SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -1.3581273801943898
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and trends observed in the molecular structures and their corresponding property values, I will predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chain Length**: 
   - Longer hydrocarbon chains (e.g., alkanes or alkyl groups) tend to have property values that decrease (become more negative) as the chain length increases. For example:
     - `CC=C` (propene): 0.8255
     - `CCCCCC` (hexane): 0.0973
     - `CCCCCC(C)C` (branched heptane): -0.7834
     - `CCCCCCC(C)O` (branched octanol): -1.0008
     - `CCCCCCCC(C)O` (branched nonanol): -2.1122
   - This suggests that increasing chain length correlates with more negative property values.

2. **Presence of Ester Group (=O)OC**:
   - Esters (R-COO-R') tend to have moderately negative or near-zero property values unless other functional groups dominate. For example:
     - `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl decanoate) is structurally similar to `CCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl octanoate), which has a value of -0.1581.
   - The ester group does not strongly push the property value toward extreme positives or negatives.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `CCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl octanoate): -0.1581
   - `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl decanoate) has two additional carbons in the chain compared to methyl octanoate. Based on the trend of increasing chain length leading to more negative values, we would expect the property value to decrease further.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Methyl octanoate (`CCCCCCCC(=O)OC`) has a value of -0.1581.
- Adding two more carbons (to make methyl decanoate) would likely decrease the property value further, but not as drastically as adding highly polar or bulky groups.

A reasonable estimate would be slightly more negative than -0.1581, but not as extreme as -2.1122 (which has a long chain + hydroxyl group). 

**Predicted property value for `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`: -0.35** (approximate, based on trends). 

This accounts for the increased chain length while recognizing that the ester group does not strongly influence the property value.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -1.251062122089329
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **benzofuran-3-one** scaffold (a benzene fused to a furanone ring) with a **lactam-like** group (`oc(=O)[nH]`). This suggests some polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.
2. **Substituents**: 
   - A **chlorine atom** is attached to the benzene ring (electron-withdrawing, increases polarity).
   - The **lactam-like group** (`oc(=O)[nH]`) introduces hydrogen-bonding capability and dipole moments.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Cl-containing aromatic systems**: 
  - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` has a property value of **0.3926** (multiple Cl atoms increase hydrophobicity slightly).
  - `Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has a value of **-1.7160** (highly chlorinated, but OH group adds polarity).
- **Lactam-like structures**: 
  - `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)` has a value of **0.5694** (highly polar due to multiple carbonyls and NH groups).
  - `Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C` has a value of **-1.0826** (bulky tert-butyl groups reduce polarity).

### Key Observations:
1. The presence of **Cl** and the **polar lactam-like group** suggests moderate polarity.
2. The **fused aromatic system** adds some hydrophobicity, but the **NH and C=O** groups counterbalance this.
3. No strongly electron-donating groups (like OH or NH2) are present, so the value won't be extremely negative.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance between the **chlorine (slightly positive contribution)** and the **polar lactam-like group (negative contribution)**, the property value is likely in the **low positive or near-zero range**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: ~0.25**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend of polar vs. nonpolar features in the examples.)  

Would you like to clarify the property being predicted (e.g., logP, dipole moment, etc.) for a more precise estimate?

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.5473444099133413
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitrate/Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O or similar)**:
   - `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` has a property value of **-1.04442108**.
   - The presence of a nitro group (N(=O)=O) tends to decrease the property value (negative contribution).

2. **Alkyl Groups**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., `CCCOCC`, `CCCCCl`) have small positive or near-zero values (e.g., 0.29375326, 0.36149239).
   - Branched alkyl groups (e.g., `CC(C)C`) have slightly lower values than linear ones.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The nitro group's negative contribution is dominant when paired with alkyl groups.
   - For example, `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` has a value of **-1.04442108**, where the nitro group is attached to a heterocycle with alkyl substituents.

### Analysis of **CC(C)N(=O)=O**:
- The molecule is a simple nitroalkane with a branched alkyl group (isopropyl, **CC(C)**) attached to a nitro group (**N(=O)=O**).
- The nitro group will strongly reduce the property value (likely between -1.0 and -1.5 based on examples).
- The isopropyl group is less stabilizing than a methyl or ethyl group, so the value may be slightly more negative than `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` (-1.044).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the dominance of the nitro group and the branched alkyl substituent, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-1.15** (approximately between -1.0 and -1.3).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is **-1.15**.

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 1.2508056779062064
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and the presence of polar or nonpolar groups. The molecule to predict is:

**CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**

### Key structural features:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a polycyclic structure resembling steroids (e.g., fused cyclohexane and cyclopentane rings), which often contribute positively to the property (e.g., see `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` with a value of **1.16721652**).
2. **Polar functional groups**: 
   - A hydroxyl group (`-OH`), which is polar and can hydrogen bond.
   - A carbonyl group (`C=O`), which is also polar and can contribute to the property.
   - A hydroxymethyl group (`-CH2OH`), adding polarity.
3. **Size and rigidity**: The molecule is large and rigid, which may increase the property value compared to simpler aliphatic or aromatic systems.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The closest example is `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` (property = **1.16721652**), which is a steroid-like molecule with two carbonyl groups but no hydroxyl or hydroxymethyl groups. The additional polar groups in the target molecule (OH and CH2OH) may slightly increase the property value.
- Another example is `CC(C)OC(=O)C(O)(c1ccc(Br)cc1)c2ccc(Br)cc2` (property = **1.21649214**), which has a high value due to aromatic rings, bromine substituents, and polar groups (ester and alcohol). The target molecule lacks halogens but has a similarly complex polar structure.

### Prediction:
Given the steroid-like core and additional polar functional groups, the property value is likely **higher than 1.16721652** but not as extreme as some halogenated or highly conjugated systems. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.25** (rounded to two decimal places). 

This balances the contributions from the polycyclic core and the polar groups.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.5188517780949552
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). From the examples:
   - Aromatic rings with halogens (e.g., Cl, Br) tend to have negative property values (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1: -0.476, Brc1ccc(Br)cc1: -1.250).
   - Fluorinated aromatics (e.g., FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1: -0.021) have less negative values than chlorinated/brominated ones.

2. **Amide/Carbamate Linkage**: The molecule has two amide-like groups (C(=O)NC(=O)N). From the examples:
   - NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1: -3.074 (thiourea-like, more negative).
   - NC(=O)c1cccnc1: -0.126 (amide, less negative).
   - The presence of two amides may push the value more negative.

3. **Chlorine Substituent**: The Cl on the second ring adds negativity (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1: -0.476).

4. **Fluorine Substituents**: The two F atoms on the first ring are less negative than Cl/Br (e.g., FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1: -0.021).

5. **Overall Polarity**: The molecule is polar due to the amides and halogens, which typically correlates with more negative values in the given examples.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest examples are:
  - NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1: -3.074 (similar amide/aromatic structure but with thiourea).
  - Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1: -0.476 (similar halogenated aromatic but no amides).
  - NC(=O)c1cccnc1: -0.126 (single amide, less negative).

Given the two amides and halogenated aromatics, the value should be more negative than -0.476 but less extreme than -3.074 (since the amides here are not thiourea-like). 

### Predicted Value:
A reasonable estimate is **-1.8** (between the more negative amide/aromatic examples and the less negative halogenated aromatics). 

### Final Answer:
**-1.8** (approximate, based on structural analogies).

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.01676695013714975
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl propyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - Molecules with ether linkages tend to have moderate property values, often around **0.0 to 0.5**, unless other strongly influencing groups are present.
   - Example: `CCOC(=O)CC` (ethyl propanoate) has a value of **0.2853058**.
   - Example: `COc1ccccc1O` (guaiacol) has a value of **-0.29453044**, but this includes an aromatic ring and a phenol group, which may lower the value.

2. **Alkyl Chains**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., `CCCCCO`, pentanol) have values around **0.30412891**.
   - Branched alkanes (e.g., `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C`) tend to have lower values (e.g., **-1.63178302**), but this is likely due to increased hydrophobicity or lack of polar groups.

3. **Branching**:
   - Branching (e.g., `CC(C)C`) often reduces the property value slightly compared to linear analogs, but the effect is not drastic unless combined with other features.

4. **Polar vs. Non-Polar**:
   - More polar molecules (e.g., with -OH, -CN, or multiple halogens) tend to have higher or lower values depending on the context.
   - Non-polar molecules (e.g., `CCCCCC1CCCC1`, decalin) have very low values (e.g., **-2.58401585**).

### Analysis of **CCCOC(C)C**:
- This is a simple ether with a linear propyl group and a branched isopropyl group.
- It lacks strongly polar or aromatic features, so the value should be moderate.
- Compared to `CCOC(=O)CC` (value **0.2853058**), this molecule is less polar (no carbonyl), so the value might be slightly lower.
- Compared to `CCCCCO` (pentanol, value **0.30412891**), this molecule is less polar (ether vs. alcohol), so the value might be slightly lower.
- Branching (isopropyl) might reduce the value slightly, but not drastically.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **CCCOC(C)C** is likely in the range of **0.0 to 0.3**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 0.15** (moderate, slightly positive due to the ether oxygen, but offset by branching and lack of strong polar groups). 

However, looking at similar examples like `CCCCCO` (0.304) and `CCOC(=O)CC` (0.285), and considering the branching reduces polarity slightly, a more precise estimate would be:

**Final predicted value: 0.20** (closer to the ether examples but accounting for reduced polarity from branching). 

Given the data, the most consistent prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 0.20**

Iteration: 7
SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: -0.6846758899605176
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **bromine (Br)** substituent, which is highly electronegative and often associated with negative property values (e.g., **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** has a value of **-7.60011593**).
   - It also has a **hydantoin-like core** (two carbonyls and an NH group in a 5-membered ring), which is polar and can influence the property.
   - An **alkyl group (CCC(C))** is attached, which typically reduces polarity but is not as dominant as electronegative substituents.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **Br** tend to have strongly negative values (e.g., **-7.60011593** for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**).
   - However, the presence of **alkyl groups** and **carbonyls** can moderate this effect (e.g., **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OC(C#N)c2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2** has a value of **1.6092497** despite having Cl substituents).
   - The **hydantoin-like core** is somewhat similar to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC**, which has a value of **-1.98209707**, but the Br here is more dominant.

3. **Expected Influence**:
   - The **Br** will likely dominate, pulling the value negative.
   - The **alkyl group and carbonyls** will partially offset this but not enough to make the value positive.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong electronegativity of Br and the moderating effects of the other groups, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-2.5 to -3.5**.  

Looking at the examples, **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is **-7.60011593**, but this molecule has fewer polar groups to offset the Br. Here, the carbonyls and alkyl group provide some balance, so a less extreme (but still negative) value is expected.  

A precise prediction based on the trend is:  
**-3.1**  

### Final Answer:
**-3.1** (approximate, based on structural analogy and trends in the given data).

Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -2.134997770831975
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), we can infer the following trends to predict the property:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative unless functionalized with strongly polar or charged groups.
   - Fused aromatic systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatics like **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67**) have higher positive values (e.g., 1.54353199), likely due to extended conjugation.

2. **Biphenyl Structure**:
   - The molecule is **biphenyl**, which consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond. This is less conjugated than fused polycyclic aromatics but more conjugated than a single benzene ring.
   - From the examples:
     - **c1ccccc1** (benzene) is not explicitly given, but substituted benzenes with simple groups (e.g., **CCCCCCC**, **CCC(C)(C)C**) have values around -0.2 to 0.1.
     - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a fused aromatic with nitrogen) has a value of 0.91257466, while **C1CCc2ccccc2C1** (a non-fused bicyclic) has -1.52028231. This suggests that non-fused linked aromatics may have intermediate values.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Biphenyl is more conjugated than a single benzene ring but less than fused polycyclics. Given the examples, its value should be slightly positive, likely in the range of **0.2 to 0.6**.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl) is:  
**0.41234567**  

*(This is an estimate based on interpolation of the given data, assuming the property scales with conjugation and aromaticity.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.16908210960103742
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as size, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and polarity. Let's analyze the molecule **CCCCS** (1-butanethiol) in this context:

1. **Structure**: A linear aliphatic chain (4 carbons) with a terminal thiol (-SH) group. 
2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **CCCC(=C)C** (property: 0.10389343): A branched alkene with 5 carbons. The property is slightly positive.
   - **CC(C)I** (property: 0.14268027): A small branched alkane with iodine. The property is slightly positive.
   - **CCCCCC(C)C** (property: -0.78339927): A larger branched alkane (7 carbons). The property is negative but modest.
   - **CCC1CCCCC1** (property: -0.52144302): A cyclohexane with an ethyl substituent. The property is moderately negative.
   - **CCCCCCCC=C** (property: -1.64392589): A larger alkene (8 carbons). The property is more negative.

3. **Thiol Group Impact**:
   - Thiols are polar but less polar than alcohols. The presence of sulfur might slightly lower the property compared to pure hydrocarbons, but the effect is likely modest given the small size of the molecule.
   - No direct examples with thiols are provided, but sulfur-containing molecules like **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O** (property: -0.58274171) and **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (property: 1.20914877) show varied properties, suggesting sulfur's impact depends on the broader context.

4. **Prediction**:
   - **CCCCS** is a small, linear molecule with a weakly polar thiol group. It lacks aromaticity, halogens, or complex functional groups that would significantly sway the property.
   - Based on similar-sized aliphatic examples (e.g., **CCCC(=C)C** at ~0.10 and **CCC1CCCCC1** at ~-0.52), the property is likely slightly negative but closer to zero due to the small size and weak polarity.

**Predicted Property Value for CCCCS**: **-0.35** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

This estimate balances the modest polarity of the thiol against the small aliphatic chain, placing it between slightly positive (for very small nonpolar molecules) and more negative values (for larger or cyclic aliphatics).

Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.40433668407084516
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or structural features that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Size**: Larger, more hydrophobic molecules (e.g., alkanes, aromatic rings) tend to have higher property values, especially if they lack polar groups. For example:
   - **CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane) has a value of **0.10222302**.
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (larger branched alkane) has a lower value of **-1.63178302**, suggesting size alone isn't the only factor.
2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - **-OH groups**: Generally decrease the property value (more negative). For example:
     - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** has a value of **-0.40927309**.
     - **CC(C)CC(C)O** has a value of **0.00165589** (less negative, possibly due to smaller size).
   - **-Cl, -Br, -NO2, -NH2**: These groups often reduce the property value (more negative), especially in aromatic systems.
3. **Branching vs. Linear**:
   - Branching can slightly increase the property value (e.g., **CCC(C)(C)C** vs. linear alkanes).
4. **Combined Effects**:
   - Molecules with both hydrophobic regions and polar groups (e.g., **CCCC(=O)OCC**) tend to have intermediate values (here, **-0.02918456**).

### Analysis of **CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
- This is a branched alkane with a terminal **-OH** group (similar to **CCCC(C)(O)CC**, which has a value of **-0.40927309**).
- The molecule is slightly smaller than **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (value: **-1.63178302**) but has a polar **-OH** group.
- The **-OH** group will likely reduce the property value compared to purely hydrophobic alkanes, but the branching may offset this slightly.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (-0.409) but with one fewer methylene group, the property value should be slightly less negative (closer to zero). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.35**  

This balances the effect of the **-OH** group (reducing the value) with the branching and smaller size (increasing the value slightly). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. If the property is something like logP, this aligns well; if it's another property, the reasoning may differ.)

Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -5.909556998368863
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is a **methyl-substituted naphthalene** (specifically, 1-methylnaphthalene). It consists of a naphthalene core (two fused benzene rings) with a methyl group (-CH3) attached to one of the rings.

### Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple benzene (c1ccccc1) has a property value of **0.31416228**.
   - Adding a methyl group to benzene (e.g., Cc1ccccc1) reduces the value (though not directly given, similar substitutions like Cc1cccc(C)c1C show negative values).
   - Naphthalene (c1ccc2ccccc2c1) is not explicitly given, but fused aromatic systems tend to have values between simple benzene and substituted versions.

2. **Substituted Aromatics**:
   - Methyl substitution generally reduces the property value (e.g., Cc1cccc(C)c1C: -1.0358692, Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1: -1.0358692).
   - Larger fused systems with substitutions (e.g., Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12: -1.64375098) show more negative values.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - The closest given example is **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (2-methylnaphthalene), which has a value of **-1.64375098**. 
   - The target molecule is **1-methylnaphthalene**, which is structurally very similar to 2-methylnaphthalene but with the methyl group at a different position. The property value is likely similar but slightly less negative due to less steric hindrance or electronic effects.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Naphthalene (unsubstituted) would likely have a value slightly lower than benzene (e.g., ~0.1 to 0.2).
- Adding a methyl group reduces the value significantly (as seen in the 2-methylnaphthalene example: -1.64375098).
- The 1-methylnaphthalene isomer might have a slightly higher (less negative) value than 2-methylnaphthalene due to positional differences.

Thus, a reasonable estimate for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (1-methylnaphthalene)** is:  
**-1.2 to -1.5**. 

A specific predicted value could be:  
**-1.4** (interpolating between the unsubstituted naphthalene and 2-methylnaphthalene examples). 

However, since the exact value for unsubstituted naphthalene isn't provided, and the 2-methylnaphthalene value is -1.64375098, a more conservative estimate might be closer to:  
**-1.3**. 

### Final Answer:
Predicted property value for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**: **-1.3**. 

*(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or additional data would be needed.)*

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: -0.2332484994223307
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic imide with two carbonyl groups and two nitrogens. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **-1.95019216**.
   - The core is identical, but the substituents differ.

2. **Substituents**: 
   - The hydantoin core is substituted with **C(C)CCC** (a branched alkyl chain) and **CC=C** (an alkenyl group). 
   - Compared to the example molecule (which has **C** and **CC=C**), this molecule has a longer/bulkier alkyl chain (**C(C)CCC** instead of just **C**).

### Comparison with Examples:
- The presence of the hydantoin core is associated with **very negative property values** (e.g., **-1.95019216** for the simpler analog).
- Adding a longer/bulkier alkyl chain (**C(C)CCC**) may slightly increase the property value (make it less negative) due to increased hydrophobicity, but the effect is likely small because the core dominates the property.
- The **CC=C** group is already present in the example and does not significantly alter the trend.

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong influence of the hydantoin core and the minor effect of the slightly larger substituent, the property value should be **close to the example but slightly less negative**. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**-1.85** (rounded from an estimated value between -1.95 and -1.75).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C** is approximately **-1.85**.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.021735150749987532
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents**:
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene): Not explicitly given, but derivatives provide clues.
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): Not given, but similar to **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), which has a value of **-2.16692781**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (dichlorobenzene): Not given, but **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (iodochlorobenzene) has **-1.81240408**, and **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) has **0.85772694**.

2. **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs)**:
   - EWGs like **-NO2**, **-CF3**, or halogens tend to increase the property value (less negative or more positive) compared to electron-donating groups (EDGs).
   - **FC(F)(F)** (trifluoromethyl) is a strong EWG, similar to halogens but more pronounced.

3. **Halogenated Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**: **-1.81240408**
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: **0.39262043**
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: **0.85772694**
   - The more halogen substitutions, the higher the property value (less negative).

4. **Trifluoromethyl Group**:
   - The **-CF3** group is more electron-withdrawing than halogens, so it should increase the property value compared to simple halogenated benzenes.

### Prediction for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1:
- The molecule is **trifluoromethylbenzene**, with a single strong EWG (-CF3) on benzene.
- Comparing to **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (**-1.81240408**), the -CF3 group is more withdrawing than -I or -Cl, so the property value should be higher (less negative).
- However, it has only one substituent, so the effect is less than heavily halogenated benzenes (e.g., **0.85772694** for hexachlorobiphenyl).
- A reasonable estimate is between **-1.0** and **0.0**, closer to **-0.5** based on the trend.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is approximately:  
**-0.75** (interpolated between simpler halogenated aromatics and heavily substituted ones). 

However, looking at **COc1ccccc1O** (anisole with -OH) at **-0.29453044** and considering -CF3 is more withdrawing than -OCH3, the value might be slightly higher. Adjusting, a better estimate is:  
**-0.50**.

But **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** is **-1.81**, and -CF3 is stronger than -I, so perhaps closer to **-1.0**. Given the ambiguity, I'll settle on:  
**-0.90** as a balanced prediction. 

### Refined Answer:
After reconsidering the examples, the most consistent prediction for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is:  
**-0.65** (reflecting the strong EWG effect but limited substitution). 

However, to align better with the given data (e.g., **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** at **-1.81** and **COc1ccccc1O** at **-0.29**), the final predicted value is:  
**-0.70**. 

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**-0.70**

Iteration: 14
SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.42619784015512546
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and overall molecular complexity. The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar alcohol (likely **sorbitol** or a similar polyol). 

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Highly polar and hydrogen-bonding molecules** (e.g., polyols, sugars) tend to have **negative or near-zero property values**:
   - `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (a hexose sugar) has a value of **-0.68037757**.
   - `CC(C)(O)CC` (a simple alcohol) has a value of **-0.00362015**.
   - `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (catechol) has a value of **0.1004389**.

2. The molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** has **five hydroxyl groups and a cyclic ether**, making it even more polar and hydrogen-bonding than the linear hexose sugar in the examples. 

3. Cyclic structures with multiple hydroxyl groups (like this one) are likely to have **more negative values** due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding.

### Prediction:
Given the trend, the property value for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** should be **more negative** than the linear hexose sugar (`-0.68037757`) but not as extreme as very nonpolar or aromatic systems (e.g., `-2.13499777` for biphenyl). 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: -0.85**  

This accounts for the additional polarity from the cyclic structure and high density of hydroxyl groups. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 1.53331989783143
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - Two acetyl (CH3-CO-) groups (ester and ketone).
   - Multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups.
   - A conjugated carbonyl (C=O) in a cyclic system.
   - A steroid-like core structure (tetracyclic ring system with fused cyclohexane and cyclopentane rings).

2. **Polarity**: 
   - The molecule is highly polar due to multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (esters, ketones, hydroxyls).

3. **Size and Complexity**: 
   - Large, polycyclic structure with significant steric bulk.

4. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The molecule resembles **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (property = 1.34011897), which also has a steroid-like core with carbonyl groups and an ester. The main difference is the additional acetyl group and hydroxyl groups in the new molecule.
   - Another similar example is **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** (property = 1.05307495), which has a hydroxyl and carbonyl in a steroid-like structure but lacks the ester/acetyl groups.

### Prediction:
The additional polar groups (acetyl and hydroxyl) in the new molecule will likely increase its property value compared to the two similar examples. The ester/acetyl groups may contribute more than the hydroxyls, as seen in the first example (1.34011897). 

Given the structural similarity but increased polarity/complexity, I predict a property value slightly higher than 1.34011897 but not excessively so due to the balancing effect of the hydroxyls. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 1.45** (rounded to two decimal places based on the trend in the examples). 

This is an estimate based on the provided data and structural reasoning. For precise predictions, computational tools or experimental measurements would be necessary.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 0.8887072716788379
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, aromaticity, functional groups, and overall molecular complexity. The molecule in question is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, hydroxyl groups, and a ketone, which suggests moderate polarity and significant molecular complexity.

Breaking it down:
1. **Rings and Saturation**: The molecule has multiple fused rings (steroid backbone), which often contribute to lower property values (more negative) due to increased hydrophobicity, but the presence of polar groups can offset this.
2. **Functional Groups**:
   - A ketone (`C=O`) is present, which is polar and tends to increase the property value (more positive).
   - A hydroxyl group (`OH`) is also present, which is highly polar and tends to increase the property value.
3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with fused rings and polar groups (e.g., `OC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O`, property = 0.72605168) have positive property values.
   - The given molecule is structurally similar to such examples but with slightly less polarity (only one `OH` and one `C=O`).

Given these observations, the predicted property value for `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O` is likely in the range of **0.5 to 0.8**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: 0.65**  

This aligns with the trend observed for similarly complex, moderately polar molecules in the provided examples.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -3.6047843205675103
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH3-CO-NH-)**: Present in the molecule (CC(=O)N-). 
     - Example with acetamide-like group: `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` has a value of **-0.74135928**.
   - **Nitro group (-N(=O)=O)**: Present on the aromatic ring. 
     - Example with nitro group on aromatic ring: `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` has a value of **-0.1548329**.
     - Another example: `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has a value of **-0.87849529**.
   - **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The molecule has a para-substituted benzene ring with acetamide and nitro groups.

2. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, while the acetamide group is moderately electron-withdrawing (due to the carbonyl). This creates a polarized system.
   - The presence of both groups on the aromatic ring may lead to additive effects on the property.

3. **Similar Examples**:
   - `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (methoxy and nitro substituents) has a value of **-0.87849529**.
   - `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (tertiary acetamide) has a value of **-0.74135928**.
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (nitrobenzene) has a value of **-0.1548329**.

### Prediction:
The molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has:
- An acetamide group (similar to the tertiary acetamide example but slightly less negative due to primary amide).
- A nitro group (similar to nitrobenzene but more negative due to additional electron-withdrawing effects).
- The combined effect of two electron-withdrawing groups (acetamide and nitro) is likely to make the property more negative than nitrobenzene but less negative than the methoxy-nitro example (due to lack of methoxy).

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate would be between **-0.5 and -1.0**. Averaging the effects of similar molecules, a predicted value of **-0.7** seems plausible.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**-0.7** (approximate, likely in the range -0.6 to -0.8). 

For specificity, we can refine this to **-0.72** based on the examples. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend of the given data.)

Iteration: 18
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 1.1589017319637231
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S)(OCC))**: This is a relatively polar and bulky functional group. Similar phosphorus-containing groups are not present in the examples, but polar/charged groups often contribute to lower or more negative property values (e.g., sulfonates or phosphates).
2. **Thiocarbamate-like linkage (SC)**: The sulfur-carbon linkage is moderately polar but less polar than an oxygen-carbon linkage. Sulfur-containing groups in the examples (e.g., CSSC, thiophenes) have property values ranging from moderately positive to negative.
3. **Chlorinated aromatic ring (cc(Cl)ccc)**: Chlorine substituents on aromatic rings in the examples (e.g., Clc1cccc2ccccc12, Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1) tend to correlate with negative property values (e.g., -4.7375016, -1.17987475).
4. **Lactam-like heterocycle (n1c(=O)oc2)**: The presence of a carbonyl (C=O) in a heterocycle (similar to the uracil-like fragments in some examples) can contribute to polarity. Examples with such groups (e.g., O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1) have negative values.
5. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**: Ether linkages are moderately polar but not as strongly as hydroxyl or carboxyl groups. Examples with ethers (e.g., COC(=O)Nc2nc1ccc(cc1[nH]2)C(=O)c3ccccc3) have positive values, but this is likely due to other dominant features.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule combines a chlorinated aromatic system (strongly negative contribution) with a phosphorothioate group (likely negative or neutral) and a polar heterocycle (negative contribution). 
- The closest analog in the examples is **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (property = -4.7375016), which is also a chlorinated aromatic system but lacks the additional polar/heterocyclic features. The additional polar groups in the target molecule may further lower the property value.
- Another relevant example is **Oc1c(Br)cc(C#N)cc1Br** (property = -5.40993693), which has highly polar substituents (Br, C#N) on an aromatic ring, leading to a very negative value. The target molecule has Cl and P(=S), which are less electron-withdrawing than Br/C#N but still significant.

### Predicted Property:
Given the combination of a chlorinated aromatic ring, phosphorothioate group, and polar heterocycle, the property value is likely **strongly negative**. A reasonable estimate is between **-3.0 and -5.0**, leaning toward the more negative end due to the cumulative effect of polar groups. 

A specific predicted value: **-4.2**. 

This aligns with the trend observed for heavily substituted aromatic systems with polar/electron-withdrawing groups in the examples.

SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.308299029251801
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - **CCCCCCC(C)O**: -1.00084878  
     (branched alcohol with a long chain)
   - **CC(C)CO**: 0.55753724  
     (branched alcohol with a shorter chain)
   - **CCCCCCCC(C)O**: -2.1121991  
     (longer chain, more negative value)
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**: -0.68037757  
     (polyol, less negative than some simpler alcohols)

2. **Branched vs. Linear Alcohols**:
   - Branched alcohols (e.g., **CC(C)CO**) tend to have higher (less negative) values than their linear counterparts (e.g., **CCCCCCC(C)O** has a more negative value).

3. **Steric Effects**:
   - More branching (e.g., **CC(C)(C)CO**) likely increases the property value compared to less branched alcohols (e.g., **CC(C)CO** has 0.55753724, so **CC(C)(C)CO** should be higher).

4. **Other Functional Groups**:
   - The presence of halogens, nitro groups, or aromatic rings can significantly affect the property, but **CC(C)(C)CO** is a simple branched alcohol.

### Prediction for **CC(C)(C)CO**:
- This is a tertiary alcohol with significant branching (more than **CC(C)CO**).
- From the trend, increased branching correlates with higher (less negative) values.
- **CC(C)CO** has a value of **0.55753724**, so **CC(C)(C)CO** should be higher due to more branching.

### Estimated Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **CC(C)(C)CO** is:  
**~0.75** (higher than **CC(C)CO** but not exceeding values like **CCC (0.82175121)** for non-alcohols).

However, looking more closely, **CC(C)CO** is already at **0.55753724**, and **CC(C)(C)CO** is even more branched, so it might be closer to **0.7-0.8**. 

A refined estimate:  
**Predicted property value for CC(C)(C)CO: 0.65**  
(conservative, accounting for branching but not exceeding simple hydrocarbons like **CCC**). 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CC(C)(C)CO: 0.65**

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -0.28050717636422934
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a bicyclic heteroaromatic system with two fused rings (imidazole and pyrimidine-like), containing multiple nitrogen atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O). This suggests significant polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.
2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Carbonyl (C=O) attached to a nitrogen-rich ring (similar to uracil or purine derivatives).
   - Multiple NH groups (hydrogen bond donors).
   - Nitrogen atoms (hydrogen bond acceptors).
3. **Similar Examples**:
   - **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (property = 0.13780296): This is a pyrimidine derivative with a carbonyl and NH group. The property is slightly positive.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)CC=C** (property = -1.56143957): This is a more saturated cyclic urea derivative with carbonyls and NH groups, but the property is more negative due to less aromaticity and more flexibility.
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property = -1.21912421): This is a purine-like system with methoxy substitution; the property is negative but less so than fully saturated cases.

### Key Observations:
- Aromatic nitrogen-rich systems with carbonyls tend to have properties in the range of **-1.5 to +0.5**, depending on substitution and hydrogen bonding capacity.
- The presence of multiple NH groups (hydrogen bond donors) and aromatic nitrogens (acceptors) can lead to moderate polarity, but the exact value depends on the balance of these features.
- The given molecule is most similar to **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** but with an additional fused ring (increasing conjugation and rigidity).

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (property = 0.13780296) but with increased hydrogen bonding capacity and rigidity, the property is likely slightly more negative. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **-0.5 to -1.0**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: -0.75** (approximate, based on structural analogy). 

This balances the polarity of the carbonyl and NH groups with the aromaticity and rigidity of the fused ring system.

Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.5396646760523234
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that might correlate with the property values:

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with polar functional groups (e.g., alcohols, esters, amines) tend to have lower (more negative) property values.
   - Nonpolar or weakly polar molecules (e.g., hydrocarbons, halogens) tend to have higher (more positive) property values.

2. **Examples with Similar Structures**:
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a steroid-like molecule with ketones and esters) has a high value of **1.34011897**.
   - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (a phosphate ester) has a very low value of **-1.38311605**.
   - **CCCOC(C)C** (an ether) has a near-zero value of **-0.01676695**.
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) has a relatively high value of **0.76473442**, likely due to its small size and hydroxyl group.

3. **Methyl Acetate (CC(C)OC=O)**:
   - This is an ester with a polar carbonyl (C=O) and ether (O) group, but it is smaller and less polar than phosphate esters or polyfunctional molecules.
   - Compared to **CCCOC(C)C** (ether, -0.01676695), the addition of the carbonyl group in methyl acetate would likely decrease the property value slightly due to increased polarity.
   - However, it is less polar than **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC**, so its value should be higher than -1.38311605.

### Prediction:
Given the trends, methyl acetate (**CC(C)OC=O**) is expected to have a property value in the slightly negative range, similar to other small polar molecules but not as extreme as highly polar or bulky ones. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

This aligns with:
- Ethers being near zero (e.g., **CCCOC(C)C** at -0.016).
- Esters with additional complexity having lower values (e.g., **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** at -1.38).
- Methyl acetate being a simple ester, so its value should be between these examples.

SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: -0.023646473203203094
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structure and compare it with the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl rings (one attached to each nitrogen of the urea group). The structure can be broken down as:
- A central urea group (**O=C(N-)2**).
- Two aromatic phenyl rings (**Nc1ccccc1** and **Nc2ccccc2**).

### Key Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings and polar substituents (e.g., **Oc1ccccc1Cl**: -0.156, **Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1**: -0.189) tend to have small negative values.
   - Molecules with multiple aromatic rings (e.g., **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12**: -1.644, **c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3**: -0.624) have moderately negative values.

2. **Urea/Carbamate Groups**:
   - Molecules with urea-like or amide groups (e.g., **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1**: -2.528, **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1**: -6.154) tend to have more negative values, especially if they are cyclic or constrained.

3. **Symmetry and Conjugation**:
   - The molecule here is symmetric and conjugated (phenyl rings attached to urea), which may stabilize the structure and influence the property.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
- Two phenyl rings (contributing to a negative value, similar to other aromatic systems).
- A urea group (likely contributing a more negative value, as seen in other amide/urea examples).
- No strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups (like NO2, OH, etc.) to significantly shift the value.

The property value is likely in the **moderately negative range**, similar to other aromatic-urea/amide structures. Comparing with:
- **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** (-2.528): This has a urea-like group and aromatic rings, but with additional alkyl substitutions (which may make it more negative).
- **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (-0.156): Simpler aromatic system with one polar group.

For **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, the symmetry and lack of additional substituents suggest a value **less negative** than **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** but more negative than simple mono-substituted aromatics.

### Estimated Property Value:
A reasonable prediction is **-1.8 to -2.5**. Given the symmetry and conjugation, I'll lean toward the middle of this range.

**Final Predicted Value: -2.1** (approximate, based on structural analogy). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend of the given data.)

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -1.3458269362054782
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is **fluorene**, which consists of two benzene rings fused to a central five-membered ring (cyclopentadiene). It is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with a rigid, planar structure and significant aromatic character.

### Comparison to Given Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Molecules like `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (property: 0.73592312) and `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` (property: 0.39262043) are also polycyclic aromatic systems. Fluorene is structurally similar but smaller and less substituted.
   - The property tends to be positive for rigid, conjugated systems.

2. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Fluorene has no polar substituents (like -Cl, -OH, or -NO₂), which often reduce the property value in the examples. Its lack of substituents suggests a moderate property value.

3. **Size and Conjugation**:
   - Fluorene is smaller than `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (a larger PAH with property 0.73592312) but larger than simple benzenes (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1` with property ~-1.0). Its intermediate size and conjugation suggest a property between these extremes.

### Prediction:
Given the above, fluorene's property should be **positive but lower than larger PAHs**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

This aligns with the trend where:
- Smaller aromatic systems (e.g., benzene derivatives) have negative or near-zero values.
- Larger, rigid, and conjugated systems (like PAHs) have higher positive values.
- Fluorene fits in the middle of this range.

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -1.734895676550033
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **NC(=N)N**: A guanidine-like group (highly polar, basic).
   - **NS(=O)(=O)**: A sulfonamide group (polar, hydrogen-bonding).
   - **Aromatic ring with NH2**: An electron-donating amino group (polar, basic).

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - The molecule has multiple polar groups (guanidine, sulfonamide, and amino) capable of strong hydrogen bonding, which typically lowers hydrophobicity (logP) or similar properties.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with sulfonamides (e.g., **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O**, property = -3.705) tend to have very low (negative) values due to high polarity.
   - Molecules with aromatic amines and polar groups (e.g., **NNc1ccccc1**, property = -0.256) have moderately negative values.
   - The guanidine-like group (NC(=N)N) is even more polar than a simple amine, further lowering the property value.

4. **Size and Aromaticity**:
   - The aromatic ring and sulfonamide add some bulk, but the polar groups dominate the property.

### Predicted Property:
Given the high polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity, the property value is likely **strongly negative**. A reasonable estimate, based on similar molecules, is:

**Predicted property value: -2.8**  

This aligns with highly polar sulfonamide/guanidine-containing molecules in the dataset (e.g., the sulfonamide example at -3.7, but slightly less extreme due to the smaller size of this molecule).

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.6697023508216349
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, I will analyze the structural features of the new molecule and compare them to the trends observed in the dataset to predict the property value.

### Molecule to predict:
**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**

### Structural features:
1. **Aromatic ring with two nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**: Nitro groups are strongly electron-withdrawing and polar. In the examples, nitro groups tend to reduce the property value (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a value of -0.304, `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` has 0.924, but the latter also has other complex features).
2. **Trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)**: This is another strong electron-withdrawing group, which likely further reduces the property value.
3. **Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C)**: Amines can increase the property value if they are basic, but here it is part of a conjugated system with the aromatic ring and nitro groups, which may reduce its impact.
4. **Alkene (CC(C)=C)**: This is a neutral feature but may slightly increase the property value due to unsaturation.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has one nitro group and a hydroxyl group, with a value of -0.304.
- `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` has two nitro groups and a complex heterocycle, with a value of 0.924.
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1` has polar amide groups and a value of 0.696.

Given the two nitro groups and the trifluoromethyl group, the molecule is highly electron-deficient and polar, which likely reduces the property value. However, the tertiary amine and alkene may offset this slightly.

### Predicted property value:
Considering the strong electron-withdrawing effects dominating, I predict a value slightly higher than `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` but lower than molecules with fewer electron-withdrawing groups. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.15**  

This balances the strong electron-withdrawing effects with the presence of the amine and alkene.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.5396646760523234
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the given data:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Alcohols (R-OH)**: Tend to have negative property values (e.g., CCCCCO → -1.004, OC1CCCCCC1 → -0.208).
   - **Ethers (R-O-R')**: Mixed, but often negative or near zero (e.g., CCOC(=O)C → -0.444, COC(=O)c1cccnc1 → -0.384).
   - **Carbonyls (C=O)**:
     - Aldehydes (R-CHO): Positive values (e.g., CCCC=O → 0.603, C=CC=O → likely high).
     - Ketones (R-CO-R'): Mixed but often positive (e.g., CC(=O)C → -1.779, but others like C=O in rings → 0.213).
   - **Esters (R-COO-R')**: Tend to be negative (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 → -3.043, CCOC(=O)C → -0.444).
   - **Halogens (Cl, Br)**: Can increase the property (e.g., ClC(Cl)Cl → 0.586, ClC=C → 0.818).
   - **Aromatic rings**: Neutral to positive (e.g., c1ccccc1 → 0.314).

2. **Structure of CC(C)OC=O**:
   - This is an ester (**methyl acetate-like structure**) with the formula CH3-COO-CH(CH3). 
   - The molecule has:
     - A carbonyl (C=O) group (ester).
     - An ether linkage (O).
     - A branched alkyl group (isopropoxy, CH(CH3)).

3. **Similar Molecules in the Data**:
   - **CCOC(=O)C** (ethyl acetate): Property = -0.444.
   - **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate, same as above): -0.444.
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): Property = 0.305 (but this is an alcohol, not an ester).
   - **CC(=O)N** (acetamide): Property = 0.865 (not directly comparable, but shows carbonyl contribution).

### Prediction:
- The molecule **CC(C)OC=O** is an ester with a branched alkoxy group (isopropoxy). 
- Esters in the data tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.444 for ethyl acetate).
- The branching (isopropoxy) might slightly increase the property compared to a straight-chain ester (due to steric/electronic effects), but not drastically.
- Given the similarity to ethyl acetate (-0.444), and accounting for branching, a reasonable estimate would be slightly less negative.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.35** (approximate, based on ester trends and branching). 

However, looking more closely:
- The isopropoxy group might add a slight positive bump (similar to how CC(C)O is 0.305 vs. CCCCCO is -1.004). 
- Thus, adjusting the ethyl acetate value (-0.444) upwards slightly (toward zero) gives a more precise estimate.

### Final Predicted Value:
**-0.23** (reflecting the ester's negative contribution offset slightly by the branched alkoxy group). 

But to align more closely with the data trends (e.g., CCOC(=O)C is -0.444, and CC(C)O is +0.305), a weighted average might land near:

**-0.15** (best guess, balancing ester and branching effects). 

Given the uncertainty, I'd lean toward **-0.20** as a conservative estimate. 

However, reviewing the data again, the closest analog is **CCOC(=O)C** (-0.444), and **CC(C)O** is +0.305. The ester dominates, so the value is likely closer to -0.4 than +0.3. 

### Revised Final Prediction:
**-0.30** (split the difference between pure ester and branched alcohol effects). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is:

**-0.30**

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.6042712133374376
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **3-methylphenol** (meta-cresol) with the structure:
- A benzene ring with:
  - A methyl group (`-CH3`) at position 1.
  - Another methyl group (`-CH3`) at position 3.
  - A hydroxyl group (`-OH`) at position 5.

### Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol) has a property value of **0.21166789**.
   - `Oc1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` (pyrogallol) has a value of **-1.44799178** (more negative due to multiple hydroxyl groups).
   - `Oc2ccc1CCCCc1c2` (tetralin with OH) has a value of **-2.00022666** (likely due to the aliphatic ring system).

2. **Methyl Substitutions**:
   - `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (xylene-like) has a value of **-0.3856455**.
   - `CCc1ccccc1C` (ethylbenzene-like) has a value of **-1.01998383**.
   - `CCc1ccccc1CC` (diphenylethane-like) has a value of **-2.16692781**.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - Methyl groups tend to slightly decrease the property value (more negative) compared to unsubstituted benzene.
   - Hydroxyl groups can either increase or decrease the value depending on context, but in phenol, it is positive (0.21166789).

### Prediction for `Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1`:
- The molecule has **two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group** on a benzene ring.
- Compared to phenol (`c1ccccc1O` = 0.21166789), adding methyl groups would likely reduce the value (as seen in xylene-like structures).
- The hydroxyl group is electron-donating, but the methyl groups are weakly electron-donating, so the net effect is likely a slight reduction from phenol's value.
- The closest analog is `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (-0.3856455), but with an added hydroxyl group, which might partially offset the reduction.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** is approximately:  
**-0.2 to -0.4**.  

A specific estimate would be:  
**-0.3**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on interpolating trends from the given data. The value is likely slightly negative due to the methyl groups but not as negative as di- or tri-substituted non-polar aromatics.)

**Final Answer:**  
**Predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1: -0.3**

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.3911140654574108
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns in the property values based on molecular features.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P=S) Groups**: 
   - Molecules with **COP(=S)(OC)O** fragments tend to have positive property values, typically in the range of **0.3 to 1.3** (e.g., 0.456, 0.698, 1.267, 0.305).
   - The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) in the aromatic ring increases the value slightly (e.g., 0.456 for Br, 0.698 for I, 0.305 for Cl).

2. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, Br, NO₂) tend to increase the property value.
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., OCH₃, CH₃) tend to decrease the property value or have a neutral effect.

3. **Thioether (S-C) Group**:
   - The presence of **SC** (thioether) in the aromatic ring is not directly represented in the examples, but sulfur-containing groups (like **S(=O)(=O)** in other molecules) tend to decrease the property value (e.g., **-1.328** for **S(N)(=O)=O**).

4. **Methyl (CH₃) Group**:
   - Methyl groups on the aromatic ring tend to slightly decrease the property value (e.g., **-0.133** for **Cc1ccccc1O**).

### Analysis of **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**:
- The molecule has a **COP(=S)(OC)O** group (similar to examples with values ~0.3–1.3).
- The aromatic ring has:
  - A **thioether (SC)** group (likely decreases the value).
  - A **methyl (CH₃)** group (likely slightly decreases the value).
- No halogens are present, which would otherwise increase the value.

### Prediction:
Given the **phosphorothioate** core (positive contribution) but the **thioether and methyl** groups (negative contributions), the property value is likely in the **lower range of the phosphorothioate examples**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**0.25** (slightly lower than the 0.305 value for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** due to the absence of halogens and presence of SC/CH₃).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.25**

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.6457712325092838
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene-like, highly chlorinated phenol): Property = **-5.09537436** (very negative).
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (polychlorinated biphenyl-like): Property = **0.85772694** (moderately positive).
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (perchlorinated biphenyl): Property = **1.04003716** (positive).

2. **Structural Features**:
   - The property seems to become more positive as the number of chlorines increases symmetrically on aromatic rings (e.g., biphenyls with many chlorines tend to have positive values).
   - Asymmetrical or highly substituted chlorinated phenols (like the first example) can have very negative values.

3. **Target Molecule Analysis**:
   - The target molecule is **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, which is a polychlorinated biphenyl derivative with 6 chlorines (similar to the third example above but with one less chlorine on the second ring).
   - The substitution pattern is less symmetrical than the perchlorinated biphenyl (which had a value of 1.04), but more chlorinated than the second example (value = 0.857).

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 0.857) but with one additional chlorine (though not fully perchlorinated), the property value should be slightly higher but not as high as the perchlorinated biphenyl (1.04). 

Thus, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.92**  

This aligns with the trend where increasing chlorination on biphenyls tends to increase the property value, but not as dramatically as in highly symmetrical or phenol-like cases.

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.5462543151417629
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** (1-nitropropane), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (NO2)**: 
   - The molecule **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** (trinitrobenzene) has a very low property value of **-2.76185978**, likely due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of multiple nitro groups.
   - The molecule **CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O** (a nitroaromatic with additional substitutions) has a higher value of **0.67393481**, suggesting that nitro groups in less conjugated or less electron-deficient systems may not depress the property as much.

2. **Aliphatic Nitro Compounds**:
   - The molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** is an aliphatic nitro compound (1-nitropropane). Aliphatic nitro groups are less conjugated than aromatic nitro groups, so their effect on the property may be less extreme.
   - Comparing to other aliphatic compounds:
     - **CCC** (propane) has a high value of **0.82175121**.
     - **CCCCCC=O** (heptanal) has a low value of **0.0697869**, suggesting that polar/aliphatic carbonyl groups reduce the property.
     - **CCCCCCCCO** (octanol) has a value of **-1.00441938**, showing that polar aliphatic groups (OH) can significantly reduce the property.

3. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The nitro group is highly polar and electron-withdrawing, similar to carbonyl or hydroxyl groups, but more strongly so. This suggests it would reduce the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.
   - However, since it is only one nitro group on a small aliphatic chain (propyl), the effect may not be as extreme as in poly-nitroaromatics.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Aliphatic nitro groups are less destabilizing than aromatic nitro groups.
- The molecule is small (3-carbon chain) with only one nitro group.
- Similar polar aliphatic compounds (e.g., **CCCCCC=O**, **CCCCCCCCO**) have property values in the range of **0.0 to -1.0**.

A reasonable estimate for **CCCN(=O)=O** would be slightly negative but not as extreme as poly-nitroaromatics. 

**Predicted property value: -0.45** (approximately midway between small polar aliphatics and nitroaromatics). 

### Note:
This is an educated guess based on the examples. For a precise prediction, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or computational tools would be needed. However, given the data, **-0.45** is a plausible estimate.
==================================================
Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.24283356723373453
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends based on molecular features that correlate with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogen Substitution (Cl, Br, F)**:
   - Molecules with halogen substitutions (especially on aromatic rings) tend to have negative property values. 
   - Example: 
     - `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` → **-0.80721655** (two halogens: Cl and Br)
     - `COc1cccc(Cl)c1` → **-0.65590597** (one Cl)
     - `COc1ccccc1Cl` → **-0.65590597** (same as above, positional isomer)
     - `Fc1ccc(F)cc1` (not in the list, but similar to Cl analogs) would likely be negative.

2. **Bromine vs. Fluorine**:
   - Bromine is larger and more polarizable than fluorine, but both are electronegative. 
   - In `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1`, the property is **-0.80721655**. Replacing Cl with F (smaller, less polarizable) might slightly increase the property (less negative), but the Br is still present.

3. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic systems with halogens (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1`) tend to have moderately negative values. Adding more halogens or electron-withdrawing groups makes the property more negative.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` → **-0.80721655** (Cl and Br on phenyl)
   - `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` is similar but replaces Cl with F. Fluorine is less polarizable than Cl, so the property might be slightly less negative (closer to zero) than the Cl/Br analog.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is expected to be slightly less negative than **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (-0.807). A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.70 and -0.75**.

#### Final Predicted Value:
**-0.73** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

This aligns with the observation that F is less polarizable than Cl but still contributes to a negative property value due to its electronegativity and the presence of Br.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -2.1819766948375245
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a bicyclic system (decane-like framework) with a hydroxyl group (OH) attached. It resembles steroid-like or terpene-like structures in the examples (e.g., molecules with multiple fused rings and polar groups like OH or C=O).
   - Example similarities:
     - **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**: Property = 1.62333163 (complex polycyclic with OH and C=O).
     - **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**: Property = 1.42029077 (similar polycyclic with OH and C=O).
     - **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: Property = 1.19766443 (polycyclic with OH and C=O).

2. **Functional Groups**: 
   - One hydroxyl group (OH), which is polar and can increase the property value (as seen in examples with OH).
   - No other polar groups (e.g., C=O, Cl, Br) that might significantly alter the property.

3. **Size and Complexity**: 
   - Smaller than the steroid-like examples above but still a fused bicyclic system. Simpler fused rings in the examples (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54**) have a property of 1.00339066.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule is less complex than the steroid-like examples with property values ~1.2–1.6 but more complex than simple linear or monocyclic molecules.
- The presence of OH suggests a higher value than non-polar molecules (e.g., **CCCC(C)(C)O** has -0.00362015, but this is linear with OH).
- Fused rings with OH (but no other polar groups) in the examples tend to have values between **0.3 and 1.2**.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to polycyclic molecules with OH groups (but fewer polar features than the highest examples), a reasonable estimate is:  
**~0.8 to 1.0**.  

A specific prediction based on the closest examples:  
**Predicted property = 0.95** (interpolating between simpler fused rings and more complex steroid-like structures).

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.5281381169167167
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: This is a notable functional group, similar to the molecule:
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property = **1.33191501**).
   The presence of **P(=S)** and the **SC(CCl)** substituent in this molecule likely contributes to its higher property value (~1.33). In our target molecule, the **SC(CCl)** is replaced with **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, which is a phthalimide-like structure.

2. **Phthalimide-like Structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: This is a cyclic imide with aromatic character, similar to other cyclic/aromatic structures in the dataset (e.g., **c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1** with property = **0.73592312**). However, the presence of **P(=S)** and the **OCC** groups may elevate the value.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - The molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** has a property of **1.33191501**.
   - Our target molecule replaces **SC(CCl)** with a less electron-withdrawing (but still conjugated) phthalimide group. This might slightly reduce the property value compared to the thioether analog.

4. **Other Influences**:
   - The **OCC** groups (ethoxy) are not strongly electron-withdrawing or donating, so their impact is likely moderate.
   - The **P(=S)** group is polarizable and may contribute positively to the property.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (1.33191501) but with a slightly less electron-rich substituent (phthalimide vs. thioether), the property value is expected to be slightly lower but still in a similar range. 

**Predicted value: ~1.25** (e.g., **1.25 ± 0.05**). 

### Final Answer:
**1.25** (approximate, based on structural analogy). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data. The actual value could vary if the property depends on subtler features not captured here.)

True Property: -1.138766218340369
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Polar Groups**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings and polar groups (e.g., C=O, N, O) tend to have higher property values. For example:
     - **COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (1.079) has multiple aromatic rings and polar Cl groups.
     - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C** (1.092) has aromatic rings, C=O, and N groups.
   - Conversely, simple aromatic systems without polar groups (e.g., **c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2**, -0.939) have lower values.

2. **Ketones (C=O)**:
   - The presence of a ketone (C=O) often increases the property value. For example:
     - **CCC(=O)C** (0.603) has a simple ketone.
     - **O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (-1.040) is an exception because it lacks additional polar groups.

3. **Heterocyclic Nitrogen Systems**:
   - Molecules with nitrogen in aromatic heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrrole) tend to have moderate to high values. For example:
     - **Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (-0.911) has multiple nitrogens but lacks polar groups, leading to a lower value.
     - **CN2C(=C(O)c1ccccc1S2(=O)=O)C(=O)Nc3ccccn3** (0.929) has nitrogens and polar groups, resulting in a high value.

4. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, C=O) increase the property value, while alkyl groups (e.g., CH3) tend to decrease it.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, which has:
- A fused aromatic system with two nitrogens (n1 and n2).
- A ketone (C=O) group directly attached to the aromatic ring.
- Two methyl groups (electron-donating).

This structure is similar to:
- **CN2C(=C(O)c1ccccc1S2(=O)=O)C(=O)Nc3ccccn3** (0.929), which has aromatic nitrogens and a ketone.
- **Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (-0.911), which lacks polar groups.

Given the presence of the ketone and aromatic nitrogens, the property value should be moderately high. However, the methyl groups may slightly reduce it.

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the above, a reasonable prediction is **0.55**. This balances the contributions of the polar C=O and aromatic nitrogens against the electron-donating methyl groups.

### Final Answer:
**0.55**

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -1.0563397461760424
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural and functional group trends that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains (Alkanes/Alkenes)**:
   - **CCC(=C)C** (isoprene-like): 0.391  
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): 0.386  
   - **CC(C)C(C)O** (branched alcohol): 0.310  
   *Trend*: Simple hydrocarbons or slightly polar groups (e.g., -OH) yield modest positive values (~0.3–0.4).

2. **Esters (RCOOR')**:
   - **CCOC(=O)N** (ethyl carbamate): 0.592  
   - **CC(C)OC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate): 0.287  
   *Trend*: Esters tend to have positive values (0.2–0.6), with simpler esters closer to 0.3–0.5.

3. **Polar/Oxygenated Groups**:
   - **O=C1CCC(=O)N1** (succinimide): 0.535  
   - **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCC1)C(=O)N2** (cyclic imide): -0.651  
   *Note*: Cyclic imides with multiple polar groups can lower the value, but linear esters are less negative.

4. **Halogenated Compounds**:
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, I) often reduce the property value (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1I**: -1.812), but this molecule lacks halogens.

5. **Long-Chain Esters**:
   - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (nonanoate ester): -3.186 (outlier, possibly due to long hydrophobic chain).  
   - **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is a shorter ester (ethyl hexanoate), so it should be less negative.

### Prediction for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- It is a linear ester with a 6-carbon chain and ethoxy group, similar to **CCOC(=O)N** (0.592) but with a longer alkyl chain.  
- The chain length may slightly reduce the value compared to simpler esters, but not as drastically as very long chains (e.g., nonanoate).  
- Expected range: **0.2 to 0.5**.

### Final Prediction:
**0.35** (moderate positive value, consistent with mid-length esters in the dataset).  

*Note*: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on structural analogs.

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6285043486288615
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and analyzing the structural features of the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Structural Similarity**: The molecule is an ester (COC=O) attached to a benzene ring. This is similar to:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC** (property = 1.29648248), but this is a diester with a longer alkyl chain, so its value is higher.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (property = -1.3645696), which is ethyl benzoate (very similar to methyl benzoate but with an ethyl group instead of methyl).
   - **O=C1N(COC(=O)CCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (property = 1.28576943), which has a more complex structure but shares the aromatic ring + ester motif.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Simple aromatic esters like **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** have negative property values (e.g., -1.3645696 for ethyl benzoate).
   - The methyl group (**COC=O**) is slightly less hydrophobic/larger than ethyl, but the difference is small.
   - The presence of the benzene ring and ester group tends to pull the property toward negative values unless balanced by bulky/hydrophobic substituents.

3. **Prediction**: Since methyl benzoate is structurally very similar to ethyl benzoate (just one carbon shorter), its property value should be close but slightly less negative due to the smaller alkyl group. 

   - Ethyl benzoate: -1.3645696  
   - Methyl benzoate (predicted): **-1.2 to -1.3** (interpolating between similar examples).

Given the data, the most reasonable prediction is:  
**Predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1: -1.28**  

*(This aligns with the trend where simpler aromatic esters have negative values, and methyl benzoate fits this pattern.)*

Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.3962586717082646
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, conjugation, halogenation, and molecular size. Let's analyze the molecule **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene) in the context of the given data:

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Simple alkenes**: 
   - **CC/C=C/C** (2-pentene) has a property value of **0.39102142**.
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene) has a value of **-0.48457973**, likely due to the aromatic ring.
   - **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane) has a value of **0.49918682**, suggesting cyclic alkanes are slightly higher than linear alkenes.

2. **Conjugated systems**:
   - Conjugation (alternating single and double bonds) often increases polarity and may influence the property value. For example, aromatic systems (like benzene derivatives) tend to have lower values unless paired with strongly polar groups.

3. **1,3-Butadiene (C=CCC=C)**:
   - This is a simple conjugated diene (no halogens, no heteroatoms, no aromaticity).
   - Compared to **CC/C=C/C** (0.391), the conjugation in 1,3-butadiene might slightly increase the property value due to enhanced electron delocalization.
   - However, it lacks the complexity or polarity of many other examples, so the value should be in the same ballpark as simple alkenes/alkanes.

### Predicted property value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate for **C=CCC=C** would be slightly higher than **CC/C=C/C** (0.391) but lower than **C1CCCC1** (0.499). 

**Predicted value: 0.45** (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity). 

However, looking at the examples more closely, the value might align more closely with **CC/C=C/C** (0.391) since conjugation alone doesn't seem to drastically increase the value in other cases. 

Thus, a more precise prediction would be:  
**Predicted value: 0.40** (to reflect slight conjugation effects while staying close to simple alkene values). 

But to match the precision of the given examples, let's provide a more specific estimate:  
**Final predicted value: 0.42**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. The true property could be something like logP, solubility, or another molecular descriptor.)

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.04360941315453432
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - Molecules with multiple heavy halogens (Br, Cl, I) tend to have more negative property values, especially when the halogens are on a small or simple hydrocarbon framework.
   - Example: 
     - **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (dichloronaphthalene-like) has a very negative value: **-4.7375016**.
     - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has **-2.22700695**.
     - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (a polyhalogenated small alkane) has **0.41765671**, but this is less negative due to fluorine's smaller size and lower polarizability.

2. **Symmetry and Size**:
   - Small, symmetric polyhalogenated molecules (e.g., **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** or **BrC(Br)Br**) often exhibit more negative values due to their high polarizability and steric/electronic effects.
   - Example: 
     - **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a trichloromethyl group) has **-4.44647219**, heavily influenced by the **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** moiety.

3. **Bromine vs. Chlorine**:
   - Bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine, so **BrC(Br)Br** would likely have a more negative value than a similar chlorinated compound (but not as extreme as very large polyhalogenated aromatics).

4. **Tribromomethane (BrC(Br)Br)**:
   - This is a small, symmetric molecule with three heavy bromine atoms, analogous to chloroform (**CHCl3**) but with bromine. 
   - Given the examples, we expect a negative value, likely between **-2.0** and **-4.0**, but not as extreme as **-4.7375016** (which is for a larger polyhalogenated aromatic system).

### Prediction:
Considering the above, **BrC(Br)Br** should have a property value close to **-3.0**, reflecting its highly halogenated nature but smaller size compared to the most negative examples. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-3.2** (specific value chosen based on interpolation of the given data). 

However, looking at the closest analog in the examples:
- **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** has **0.41765671**, but this is less negative due to fluorines.
- **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** has **-4.7375016**, but this is a much larger system.

Given that **BrC(Br)Br** is simpler but heavily brominated, a value around **-3.5** seems plausible. 

### Final Answer:
**-3.5** (approximate interpolation based on the given examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend of halogenation and molecular size in the provided data.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 1.3319150138295481
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphate-like group (P(=S)(OCC))**: This is similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**, which has a property value of **1.28369402**. The presence of a thiophosphate group (P=S) with ethoxy (OCC) substituents suggests a moderately positive contribution to the property.

2. **Aromatic system (c1ccccc1)**: Aromatic rings are common in the examples, and their contribution varies. For instance, **c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2** has a value of **-0.93892582**, while **N#Cc1ccccc1** has a value close to **0**. The presence of a benzene ring here is likely neutral to slightly negative.

3. **Lactam-like group (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: This resembles a phthalimide-like structure. Similar groups (e.g., **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O**) have values around **0.90533136**, suggesting a positive contribution.

4. **Chlorine substituent (C(CCl))**: Chlorine atoms often reduce the property value (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** has **-2.81070472**), but in this case, it is part of a larger functionalized group, so its impact may be mitigated.

5. **Ethoxy groups (CCOP and OCC)**: These are present in **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**, which has a value of **1.28369402**, suggesting they contribute positively.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 (1.28369402)**, which shares the P(=S)(OR)2 motif and aromatic/amide features.
- The lactam group in the target molecule is similar to **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O (0.90533136)**.

### Estimated Property:
Given the combination of the thiophosphate group (positive contribution), aromatic system (neutral), and lactam (positive), the property value is likely in the range of **0.9 to 1.3**. 

Considering the slightly less polarizable structure compared to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**, I would predict a value closer to the lower end of this range.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 1.05** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the given data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the examples provided.)

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 1.092224826376166
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values appear to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group contributions (e.g., nitro groups, carbonyls, halogens, etc.). The property seems to be a composite of these factors, where electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) and hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors (e.g., OH, NH) tend to decrease the value, while nonpolar/aliphatic regions and certain heterocycles may increase it.

Let's analyze the target molecule:  
**CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**  

### Key features:
1. **Polar/hydrogen-bonding groups**:  
   - Amide (**C(=O)N**): Strong H-bond acceptor/donor (lowers value).  
   - Urea-like fragment (**N(C)C(=O)N**): Further enhances polarity (lowers value).  
   - Chloro-substituted aromatic ring (**c(Cl)c1**): Electron-withdrawing (lowers value).  
   - Oxadiazole heterocycle (**n2nc(oc2=O)**): Polar and H-bond accepting (lowers value).  

2. **Nonpolar/bulky groups**:  
   - Tert-butyl (**C(C)(C)C**): Sterically bulky but nonpolar (may slightly raise value).  
   - N,N-dimethyl (**N(C)C**): Moderately polar but less impactful than H-bond donors.  

3. **Aromatic systems**:  
   - Chlorinated phenyl ring and fused oxadiazole: Aromaticity with electron-withdrawing effects (net lowering).  

### Comparison to examples:  
- Similar to **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (value: **-3.074**), but with additional polar groups (oxadiazole, Cl) and less acidic thioamide.  
- Closer to **Nc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (value: **-0.596**) but more polar due to the amide and oxadiazole.  
- The tert-butyl may offset slightly, but the net effect is strongly negative.  

### Predicted value:  
Given the cumulative polarity and electron-withdrawing effects, the predicted property value is likely in the range of **-1.5 to -2.5**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**-1.92**  

This balances the strong polar contributions against the bulky tert-butyl group.

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 0.2597823803126098
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Rings**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine substitutions on aromatic rings tend to have negative property values, often more negative with increasing chlorine count.
   - Example: 
     - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** → **-0.67127911** (2 Cl)
     - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** → **-5.09537436** (4 Cl)
     - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2** → **-0.33648783** (2 Cl)

2. **Phenol Groups (-OH on Aromatic Rings)**:
   - Phenol groups (especially multiple -OH) often contribute to negative property values, but the effect is less pronounced than heavy halogenation.
   - Example: 
     - **COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1** → **-1.44799178** (3 OH)
     - **Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1** → **-0.18901671** (1 OH)

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The presence of both phenol groups and chlorine substitutions tends to make the property more negative, with chlorine dominating the effect.
   - Example: 
     - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** → **-5.09537436** (extreme due to 4 Cl + 1 OH).

### Target Molecule: **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**
- **Structure**: Two phenol-linked chlorinated benzene rings (3 Cl total: 1 Cl on one ring, 2 Cl on the other).
- **Comparison**:
  - Similar to **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (2 Cl, 1 OH → **-0.67127911**) but with an additional phenol and 1 more Cl.
  - The additional phenol and Cl will likely make the property more negative, but not as extreme as **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (4 Cl).
  - The symmetric structure with two phenol groups and 3 Cl suggests a moderate to strong negative value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate is between **-1.5 and -2.5**. A specific prediction could be:  
**-1.892**.  

This accounts for:
- The 3 Cl substitutions (strong negative contribution).
- The 2 phenol groups (moderate negative contribution).
- The lack of extreme halogenation (unlike the -5.09 case with 4 Cl).

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.39102141977369026
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the molecule **CC/C=C\C** is very similar to **CC/C=C/C** (which has a property value of **0.39102142**). The only difference is the stereochemistry of the double bond (trans vs. cis).  

Given that stereochemistry can influence molecular properties but often not drastically for simple hydrocarbons like this, I would predict a value close to the trans isomer.  

**Predicted property value for CC/C=C\C: ~0.38 to 0.40**  

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**0.39** (similar to the trans form, with slight variation due to minor steric differences).  

(Note: If the property is logP or a similar descriptor, cis-alkenes tend to be slightly less favorable than trans due to steric clashes, so the value might be marginally lower.)

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 0.293753259868807
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes**: 
   - **C** (methane): 1.14804528 (high value)
   - **CC#C** (propyne): 0.87900534 (moderately high)
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): 0.68835418 (slightly lower than propyne)
   - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-octene): -0.78011019 (lower due to longer chain and unsaturation)

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): 0.76473442 (alcohol, moderately high)
   - **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol): 0.30544096 (alcohol, lower than isopropanol)
   - **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate): -0.02380443 (ester, near zero)
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (methoxyphenol): -0.29453044 (ether + phenol, slightly negative)
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate): -1.3645696 (ester, negative)

3. **Ethers**:
   - **CCCOCC** is an ether (diethyl ether). From the examples, ethers seem to have property values in the middle range, but there are no exact ether examples. The closest is **COc1ccccc1O** (methoxyphenol), which has a value of -0.29453044, but this also includes a phenol group.

4. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer chains tend to decrease the property value (e.g., **CCCCCCC=C** is lower than **CC#C**).
   - Branching may increase the value slightly (e.g., **CC(C)O** is higher than **CCC(O)CC**).

### Prediction for CCCOCC:
- **CCCOCC** is a simple, symmetric ether with no branching and a moderate chain length (5 carbons total). 
- Compared to **CC(C)O** (isopropanol, 0.76473442), the ether linkage (**O**) might reduce the value slightly because ethers are less polar than alcohols.
- Compared to **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol, 0.30544096), the absence of an OH group might further reduce the value.
- The closest analog is **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate, -1.3645696), but this is an ester with an aromatic ring, so it's not directly comparable.
- Given the lack of exact ether examples, I estimate the value to be slightly positive but lower than simple alcohols.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, I predict the property value for **CCCOCC** to be approximately **0.25**. This is based on:
- Ethers being less polar than alcohols but still having some polarity.
- The symmetric, small size of the molecule suggesting a moderate value.

**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value for **CCCOCC** is **0.25**.

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.8926636243116302
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary amide** group (`N(C=O)`), which is polar and can influence the property value.
   - It has two **phenyl rings** (aromatic systems: `c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`), which are hydrophobic but can participate in π-stacking or dipole interactions.
   - The **tert-butyl group** (`C(C)(C)C`) attached to one phenyl ring adds steric bulk and hydrophobicity.

2. **Similar Molecules in the Dataset**:
   - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property: -0.50319576): This is a simple biphenyl-like structure with no polar groups. The property is moderately negative due to hydrophobicity.
   - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property: 0.97096049): This has a tertiary amide and aromatic rings, similar to our target molecule, but with an additional heterocyclic system (`COc1nc2ccccc2s1`). The property is positive, likely due to the polarizable sulfur and oxygen atoms.
   - **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23** (property: -0.22863742): This has a tertiary amide and aliphatic rings, resulting in a slightly negative property.

3. **Key Differences**:
   - Our target molecule lacks highly polarizable heteroatoms (like S or additional O/N) seen in **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3**, which likely pushes its property toward positive values.
   - It is more hydrophobic than **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23** due to the phenyl rings, but the tert-butyl group adds steric hindrance, which may reduce polarity further.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between:
- The polar tertiary amide (tending to increase the property value),
- The hydrophobic phenyl and tert-butyl groups (tending to decrease the property value),
- The absence of strongly polarizable groups (like S or multiple O/N),

The property value is likely **slightly positive but closer to zero** compared to the examples. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

This is based on interpolation between:
- The slightly negative value of **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23** (-0.23) due to aliphatic hydrophobicity,
- The higher positive value of **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (0.97) due to additional polarizability,
- The neutral-to-moderate hydrophobicity of the phenyl/tert-butyl system. 

Thus, **0.45** is a plausible prediction.

To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a substituted benzene ring with:
   - An acetamido group (**CC(=O)N-**).
   - A bromine substituent (**Br**).
   - The substitution pattern is para (1,4-disubstituted benzene).

2. **Key Functional Groups**:
   - **Amide (CC(=O)N-)**: Amides are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (as acceptors). In the examples, amides often appear with moderately negative or positive values depending on other substituents.
   - **Bromine (Br)**: Halogens like bromine tend to contribute negatively to the property (e.g., see `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` with -0.242, `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` with -0.407).
   - **Aromatic Ring**: The benzene ring itself is neutral, but substituents dominate the property.

3. **Similar Examples**:
   - `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` has a property of **-0.40762555**. This is a phenol with a para-bromine.
   - `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` (toluene with para-amino) has **-0.3856455**.
   - `Clc1ccccc1` (chlorobenzene) has **-0.42755549**.
   - `Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1` (benzaldehyde with para-hydroxy) has **-0.18901671**.

4. **Effect of Acetamido (CC(=O)N-)**:
   - The amide group is more polar than a simple hydroxy or amino group but less polar than a nitro or carbonyl. It may slightly increase the property value compared to simple halogens or hydroxy groups.
   - In `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`, the amide contributes to a positive value (**0.89266362**), but this is a more complex case with two aromatic rings.

### Prediction:
The bromine substituent pulls the property value down (negative contribution), while the acetamido group may partially offset this. Given the similarity to `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (-0.407) and `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` (-0.385), but with the amide being slightly less negative than hydroxy or amino, we expect a value slightly less negative than these.

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.3 and -0.4**. Averaging the trends, I predict:

**Predicted property value: -0.35** (specific value: **-0.35000000**).

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, dipole moment, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. The value is most consistent with the trend of halogenated aromatic compounds with polar substituents.

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -2.0848534333399713
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): Property = **-0.3856455**
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene): Property = **-1.01998383**
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene): Property = **-2.19493433**
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24** (polyaromatic): Property = **0.73592312**

   The property becomes more negative as the alkyl chain on the benzene ring becomes bulkier (methyl → ethyl → isopropyl). This suggests that larger alkyl groups attached to the aromatic ring decrease the property value.

2. **Isobutyl Group**:
   - **CC(C)CCO** (isobutanol): Property = **0.30829903**
   - **CC(C)CO** (isopropanol): Property = **0.55753724**
   - **CC(C)CCCO** (branched alcohol): Property = **0.0**

   The isobutyl group (CC(C)C-) appears in these examples with positive or neutral property values when not attached to an aromatic ring.

3. **Combined Structure (Isobutylbenzene)**:
   - The molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** has an isobutyl group attached to a benzene ring. Based on the trend:
     - Toluene (methylbenzene): **-0.3856455**
     - Ethyltoluene: **-1.01998383**
     - Isopropyltoluene: **-2.19493433**
   - The isobutyl group is larger than ethyl and isopropyl, so we might expect a further decrease in the property value. However, the isobutyl group is less bulky than a tert-butyl group (not in examples), so the decrease may not be as extreme as for isopropyltoluene.

### Prediction:
Given the trend, the property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** should be more negative than ethyltoluene (-1.01998383) but less negative than isopropyltoluene (-2.19493433). A reasonable estimate would be around **-1.5**, considering the branching in the isobutyl group.

However, looking at the examples more carefully:
- The jump from methyl (-0.38) to ethyl (-1.02) is ~ -0.64.
- The jump from ethyl (-1.02) to isopropyl (-2.19) is ~ -1.17.
- The isobutyl group is intermediate in bulkiness between ethyl and isopropyl, so the decrease might be slightly less than the ethyl-to-isopropyl jump.

Thus, a refined estimate would be closer to **-1.6**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is **-1.6**.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.05159531359236796
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Polar Substituents**:
   - **COc1ccccc1** (anisole): Property = -0.14617854  
     (Methoxy group on benzene)
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (paracetamol-like): Property = -0.4946276  
     (Amide and hydroxyl on benzene)
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): Property = -0.89369585  
     (Strongly electron-withdrawing nitro groups)

2. **Carbonyl Groups on Aromatic Rings**:
   - **Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1** (thiazole with carbonyl): Property = -0.07373578  
     (Heterocyclic carbonyl, less negative)
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (imide): Property = 0.30143268  
     (Two aromatic rings + carbonyl, slightly positive)

3. **Benzaldehyde-Like Structures**:
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** has a single aldehyde group (–CHO) directly attached to benzene.  
     This is less electron-withdrawing than nitro groups but more polar than methoxy.

### Comparison:
- The aldehyde group is moderately electron-withdrawing but lacks the strong negative impact of nitro groups or multiple halogens (e.g., **Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl** with property = -5.09537436).
- The property values for monosubstituted benzenes with polar groups tend to fall in the range of **-0.5 to 0.0**.

### Prediction:
Given the examples, **benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1)** is likely to have a property value slightly more negative than anisole (-0.146) but less negative than paracetamol-like structures (-0.494). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.35**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the trend. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -1.7036816069816887
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key structural observations:
1. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Present in the molecule, similar to the first example (Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2, which has a property value of **0.2585225**. Nitro groups often contribute positively to the property value when attached to aromatic systems.
2. **Heterocyclic core with two amide (C=O) groups**: The central structure is a 5-membered ring with two amide groups (O=C2CN...C(=O)N2). This resembles polar, hydrogen-bonding motifs, which may moderately influence the property.
3. **Aromatic system with an oxygen (o1)**: The presence of an aromatic ring with an oxygen (likely furan-like) is somewhat similar to the third example (Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2), which has a property value of **-1.25106212**, but here the nitro group and additional polar groups may counteract negative contributions.
4. **Overall polarity**: The molecule is highly polar due to the nitro group, amides, and heterocycle. Polar molecules in the examples span a wide range, but nitroaromatics tend to have positive values (e.g., the first example at **0.2585225**).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The closest analog is the first example (Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2), which has a nitro group attached to an aromatic system and a property value of **0.2585225**. However, the given molecule has additional polar amide groups and a heterocycle, likely increasing the property value slightly.
- Another similar example is CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (property **0.89266362**), which has amide and aromatic groups but lacks the nitro group. The nitro group here may add some positive contribution.

### Predicted property:
Given the nitro group's positive contribution and the polar amide/heterocyclic core, the property value is likely in the **moderately positive range**, similar to other nitroaromatics but slightly higher due to the additional polar groups. 

**Predicted value: 0.45**  
*(This is an estimate based on the structural trends observed in the examples, particularly balancing the nitro group's effect and the polar heterocycle.)*

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.5213240612743102
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **0.02265308**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene-like structure) has a property value of **-0.92139193**.
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but with a single bond between the nitrogens instead of a double bond. This suggests it might have a less negative (or more positive) value than **-0.92139193**.

2. **Electron-Donating vs. Electron-Withdrawing Effects**:
   - The **N-N** linkage in **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is less electron-withdrawing than the **N=N** linkage in **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, so the property value should be less negative.

3. **Symmetry and Conjugation**:
   - The molecule is symmetric and conjugated, similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but the single bond reduces the conjugation extent compared to the double bond.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** should be between the value for **Nc1ccccc1** (**0.02265308**) and **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (**-0.92139193**). A reasonable estimate would be slightly negative but less so than the azo compound.

**Predicted property value: -0.45** (approximate, based on interpolation between the two reference points). 

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at the trend:
- **Nc1ccccc1**: +0.022
- **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: Likely closer to zero than **N=N** but still negative due to reduced electron density from the additional nitrogen.
- **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: -0.921

A plausible midpoint is around **-0.45 to -0.50**. Given the examples, I'll lean toward **-0.48**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: -0.48**

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -1.4045544537187122
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure (cyclohexane-like ring, **CCCC1**). It is a bicyclic system with fused 5- and 6-membered rings (imidazolidine-2,4-dione core, similar to hydantoin derivatives).
2. **Polarity**: The amide groups are polar, but the cyclohexane-like ring reduces overall polarity.
3. **Similar Examples**:
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = **-6.15396577**): This is a similar bicyclic diamide (hydantoin derivative) with additional alkyl substitution. Its very low value suggests strong polarity or specific interactions.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = **-0.7213568**): Another hydantoin derivative with alkyl chains, less negative than the first example.
   - **O=C1CCCN1** (property = **0.54172067**): A simple cyclic amide (lactam), less polar than the diamide.

### Key Observations:
- The presence of two amide groups in a small, rigid bicyclic system (like hydantoin) tends to lower the property value due to high polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.
- Lack of bulky alkyl groups (unlike **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1**) means the effect is less extreme than **-6.15** but still significant.
- The cyclohexane-like ring adds some hydrophobicity, offsetting the polarity slightly.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to hydantoin derivatives and the balance between polarity (from amides) and hydrophobicity (from the ring), the property value is likely **negative but not as extreme as -6.15**. A reasonable estimate is between **-1.0 and -2.0**.

Looking at the examples:
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (-0.72) is a good analog but with more alkylation.
- The simpler bicyclic diamide here should be slightly more negative due to less alkyl shielding.

### Final Prediction:
**-1.25**.

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data. If the property is logP, the value aligns with expectations for a polar bicyclic diamide.)

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.07830232425245458
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Heavy halogen substitution**: The molecule is a biphenyl derivative with **three chlorine atoms** (two on one ring, one on the other). Halogens (especially multiple substitutions) often increase the property value (e.g., see `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` with a value of **0.973** due to heavy Cl substitution).
2. **Biphenyl core**: The biphenyl scaffold is present in some examples, but the property depends heavily on substituents. For instance:
   - `Clc1ccccc1Cl` (dichlorobenzene) has a value of **-0.477**.
   - `C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13` (polycyclic aromatic) has a value of **0.408**.
3. **Symmetry and conjugation**: The conjugated biphenyl system with chlorine substitutions suggests moderate polarity and potential for higher values than simple chlorobenzenes.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The closest analog is `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (property = **0.973**), which has even more Cl substitutions and a bulky central group. Our molecule has fewer Cl atoms but a similar biphenyl core.
- Another relevant example is `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` (property = **0.924**), where the Cl is part of a complex heterocyclic system.

### Prediction:
Given the **three chlorine substitutions** and the **biphenyl scaffold**, the property value should be **slightly lower** than the heavily chlorinated example (0.973) but higher than simple dichlorobenzene (-0.477). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.75**  

This balances the electron-withdrawing effects of the Cl atoms and the conjugated system while accounting for the lack of additional bulky substituents.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -2.1669278124562092
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline): Property = -0.3856455  
     (Aromatic ring with a methyl and an amino group.)
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): Property = -1.43221004  
     (Aromatic ring with a long alkyl chain.)
   - **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine): Property = -0.19956551  
     (Heteroaromatic ring with an ethyl group.)

2. **Symmetry and Branching**:
   - **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is a symmetric molecule with two ethyl groups on a benzene ring (para-diethylbenzene). Symmetric alkyl-substituted aromatics in the examples tend to have moderately negative to near-zero property values (e.g., hexylbenzene is -1.43, while ethylpyridine is -0.20).

3. **Polar vs. Nonpolar Groups**:
   - The absence of polar groups (like -OH, -NO2, -CO) in **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** suggests the property will be less negative than molecules with polar substituents but more negative than highly nonpolar branched alkanes.

4. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): -1.43221004  
     (Long alkyl chain reduces the property significantly.)
   - **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine): -0.19956551  
     (Ethyl group + heteroatom in the ring.)
   - **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** has two ethyl groups, which are less hydrophobic than a hexyl group but more than a single methyl. Symmetry may slightly increase the property compared to mono-substituted aromatics.

### Prediction:
Given the symmetry and the presence of two ethyl groups (less hydrophobic than a hexyl but more than a methyl), the property value for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is likely to be between **-0.5 and 0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.25**  

This aligns with the trend that symmetric, lightly alkyl-substituted aromatics have moderately low (but not extremely negative) property values in the given dataset.

Iteration: 53
SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -1.328477757978199
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains an **aniline (Nc1ccccc1)** core, which is a benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2). 
2. **Substituent**: The aniline is substituted with a **sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O)** at the para position relative to the amino group. This is a strongly electron-withdrawing and polar group.
3. **Similar Examples**:
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (nitroaniline) has a property value of **-0.59568616**. The nitro group (-NO2) is also strongly electron-withdrawing, similar to the sulfonamide group here.
   - **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12** (purine-like structure) has a value of **-0.437741**, which is less negative than nitroaniline, likely due to less electron withdrawal.
   - **Oc1ccncc1** (pyridinol) has a value of **0.34576295**, showing that heterocycles with polar groups can have positive values.

### Key Observations:
- The sulfonamide group is even more polar and electron-withdrawing than a nitro group, so we expect the property value to be more negative than nitroaniline (-0.59568616).
- However, the sulfonamide group is bulkier and may have additional steric or conformational effects that could moderate its impact compared to the nitro group.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the stronger electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonamide group compared to the nitro group, but also considering potential steric effects, a reasonable estimate would be slightly more negative than nitroaniline. 

**Predicted property value: -0.75** (approximate, based on structural analogy and trends in the given data). 

This aligns with the trend that strongly electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings (especially when paired with an electron-donating group like -NH2) tend to yield more negative property values in the dataset.

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 0.17861917484091686
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings, forming a **tetracene-like structure** (though not linear; it's a bent or angular arrangement). The SMILES notation breaks down as:
- **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**: This describes a system where:
  - Ring 1: Benzene (c1ccc...)
  - Ring 2: Fused to Ring 1 (c2...)
  - Rings 3 and 4: Additional fused benzene rings forming a bent tetracyclic system.

### Comparison to Examples:
1. **Similar PAHs in the Dataset**:
   - **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (property: **0.92467327**): A tetracyclic PAH with a methyl group.
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (property: **1.00339066**): A pentacyclic PAH (5 fused rings).
   - **Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32** (property: **0.02642707**): A smaller tricyclic PAH with a methyl group.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Larger, more conjugated PAHs tend to have **higher positive values** (e.g., 0.92–1.00 for 4–5 rings).
   - The absence of electronegative substituents (like Cl, Br, NO₂) avoids negative shifts.
   - The molecule lacks heteroatoms or polar groups, which often reduce the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the **tetracyclic aromatic structure** and similarity to the examples with values ~0.92–1.00, the predicted property value for **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** is likely slightly lower than the pentacyclic example (1.003) but higher than the tricyclic one (0.026). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.95** (approximate; likely between 0.90 and 1.00 based on conjugation and size).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend that larger, more conjugated systems in the dataset have higher values.)*

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 0.3893656244995204
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH), an ether linkage (-O-), and a carbonyl group (C=O). These polar groups suggest some degree of hydrophilicity or hydrogen-bonding capacity.
2. **Aromaticity**: The molecule has two aromatic rings (benzene-like structures), which contribute to its rigidity and potential for π-π interactions.
3. **Symmetry and Conjugation**: The system is conjugated (alternating single and double bonds), which can stabilize the molecule and influence its electronic properties.
4. **Size and Complexity**: The molecule is moderately large with fused rings and multiple substituents, similar to some of the higher-molecular-weight examples in the dataset.

### Comparison to Examples:
- Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, property = 1.043) or fused aromatic systems (e.g., **c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45**, property = 1.003) tend to have property values in the **0.5–1.5 range**.
- The presence of electron-donating groups (-OH) and conjugation may increase the property value, as seen in **OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5** (property = 2.194), though this is an extreme case due to its size.
- The carbonyl group and ether linkage may moderate the effect, as in **O=C1CNC(=O)N1** (property = 0.576).

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarities to molecules with property values in the **1.0–1.5 range**, and considering the balance of polar groups and aromaticity, a reasonable prediction for **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3** would be:

**Predicted Property Value: 1.25**  

This estimate is based on the molecule's resemblance to moderately polar, conjugated, and aromatic systems in the dataset, which typically exhibit values in this range.

True Property: -1.271340146117321
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., P=O, P=S)**:
   - Molecules with phosphate/thiophosphate groups (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) tend to have **moderate positive values (~0.3 to ~0.7)**.
   - The presence of **P=O** (as in `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) gives a higher value (**0.69461505**) compared to **P=S**.
   - The property seems to increase with additional electronegative substituents (e.g., Cl atoms).

2. **Amide/Carbamate groups (e.g., NC=O)**:
   - Molecules like `CCCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2` (with carbamate) have **higher positive values (~0.9)**.
   - Simple amides (e.g., `NC(=O)c1cccnc1`) have **slightly negative to near-zero values (-0.126)**.

3. **Sulfur-containing groups (e.g., SC)**:
   - Thioether/thiol groups (e.g., `Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1`) tend to have **near-zero or slightly negative values (-0.073)**.
   - Thiophosphates (e.g., `COP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C`) have **higher positive values (~1.267)**.

4. **Combined effects**:
   - When **P=O**, **NC=O (amide)**, and **SC** are combined (as in the target molecule), the property is likely **moderately positive**, similar to other phosphorus-amide-thioether hybrids.

### Target Molecule: **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**
- Contains:
  - A **phosphate group (P=O)** (tends to increase the property).
  - An **amide (NC=O)** (moderate effect, depends on context).
  - A **thioether (SC)** (slight positive or neutral effect).
- No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, NO₂) to push the value higher.
- Structurally similar to `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (value = **0.69461505**), but without the Cl substituents (which would reduce the value slightly).
- The amide (NC=O) may slightly increase the value compared to pure phosphate/thioether systems.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted value for **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** is likely in the range of **0.5 to 0.7**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.62**

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.609458681731124
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a high positive value (**0.85772694**), suggesting that multiple chlorines can increase the property value.
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (dichlorophenol) has a negative value (**-0.67127911**), indicating that chlorines attached to aromatic rings with polar groups (like -OH) may decrease the property.
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (chloroaniline) has a negative value (**-0.41356646**), similar to the dichlorophenol case.

2. **Alkenes and Simple Chlorinated Alkenes**:
   - **CCC=O** (butyraldehyde) has a positive value (**0.80600104**), suggesting that double bonds (C=O) can increase the property.
   - **CC(=O)C** (acetone) has a positive value (**0.36371755**), reinforcing that C=O increases the property.
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane) has a positive value (**0.67296978**), indicating that halogens (Br, Cl) on small aliphatic chains may increase the property.

3. **Dichloroethene (Cl\C=C/Cl)**:
   - This is a small, symmetrical molecule with two chlorines on a double bond. 
   - The presence of halogens (Cl) and a double bond (C=C) suggests a moderate positive contribution to the property, similar to **CCBr** or **CCC=O**, but less than highly chlorinated aromatics.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends:
- Small aliphatic chlorinated compounds (**CCBr**) have values around **0.6–0.8**.
- The double bond (C=C) may add a slight positive contribution, but the symmetry and lack of additional functional groups likely limit the effect.

Thus, a reasonable prediction for **Cl\C=C/Cl** is:  
**0.65** (approximate, based on the closest analogs like **CCBr** and **CCC=O**).  

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at **CCBr (0.67296978)** and **CCC=O (0.80600104)**, and considering that two chlorines might balance the effect of the double bond, the value is likely slightly lower than **CCBr** but still positive.  

**Final Prediction: 0.55** (conservative estimate, accounting for symmetry and lack of additional contributions).  

---  
**Answer:** The predicted property value for **Cl\C=C/Cl** is approximately **0.55**.  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on structural analogs in the dataset.)*

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 0.43860211543816224
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic rings with no substituents or simple substituents tend to have property values around **-0.5 to -1.5**.
     - Example: `CNc1ccccc1` (N-methylaniline) has a value of **-0.4264797**.
     - Example: `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43` (polycyclic aromatic) has **1.06373116**, but this is a much larger system.
   - Pyridine (`c1ccncc1`) is a simple aromatic heterocycle, similar to benzene but with a nitrogen atom.

2. **Heteroatom Effects**:
   - Nitrogen in aromatic rings (e.g., `CNc1ccccc1`) slightly reduces the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.
   - Oxygen substituents (e.g., `Oc1cccc(Cl)c1`) tend to lower the value further (e.g., **-0.15656388**).

3. **Simple Heterocycles**:
   - `COc5cc4OCC3Oc2c1CC(Oc1ccc2C(=O)C3c4cc5OC)C(C)=C` (complex heterocycle) has **1.56343991**, but this is a very large and complex system.
   - `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (a fused nitrogen heterocycle) has **-1.21912421**, suggesting nitrogen-rich systems may lower the value.

4. **Pyridine-Specific**:
   - Pyridine is a simple 6-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen. It is more polarizable than benzene but lacks additional substituents or complexity.
   - From the examples, simple aromatic systems with one heteroatom tend to have values around **-0.5 to -1.0**.

### Prediction:
Given that pyridine is a simple aromatic heterocycle with one nitrogen and no substituents, its property value is likely slightly more negative than benzene-like systems but less negative than highly substituted or polycyclic systems. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value for c1ccncc1: -0.75**  

This aligns with the trend of simple heteroaromatics having moderately negative values in the given dataset.

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 1.417963548002568
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Polar functional groups**: 
   - Hydroxyl groups (`OCC(O)CO-`) – similar to polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (property = -0.680).
   - Ester (`COC(=O)-`) – similar to `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` (property = -0.737).
   - Amine linkage (`Nc2ccnc3...`) – similar to `Nc1ccccc1` in some examples (e.g., `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2`, property = -0.024).
   - Chloro-substituted aromatic (`cc(Cl)ccc23`) – similar to `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (property = -1.812) or `Clc1ccccc1` (property = -0.448).

2. **Aromatic systems**: 
   - Benzene (`c1ccccc1`) and fused heteroaromatic (`nccnc`) rings – similar to polyaromatics like `c1ccc2cnccc2c1` (property = -1.231) or `c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3` (property = -0.624).

3. **Molecular size and complexity**: 
   - The molecule is large and multifunctional, akin to `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54` (property = +1.064) or `CN(CC)C(=O)C(C)Oc1cccc2ccccc12` (property = +0.859), but with more polar groups.

### Property Trends Observed:
- **Polar groups (OH, COO, NH)** tend to *lower* the property value (e.g., polyols and amines have negative values).
- **Aromatic systems** with halogens (Cl) further reduce the value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` = -1.812).
- **Large conjugated systems** can increase the value (e.g., polyaromatics with +1.064 or +1.544).
- **Balanced polar/nonpolar** features (e.g., `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2`) yield values near zero (-0.024).

### Prediction:
This molecule has:
- Multiple polar groups (OH, ester, amine) pushing the value downward.
- A chloro-substituted aromatic system (further lowering).
- Significant size/conjugation (partially offsetting the polar effect).

Given these competing factors, the value is likely **moderately negative**, similar to other polar aromatic compounds like `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1N` (-3.043) or `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` (-0.024). However, the additional chloro and hydroxyl groups suggest a stronger negative contribution.

### Final Prediction:
**Property value = -1.85**  
*(Rationale: Between the highly negative chloro-aromatic examples (-1.812) and the large polar/aromatic hybrids (-0.737 to -3.043), this molecule's complexity places it near the middle of this range.)*

Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 0.3041289147921487
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values appear to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, size, and aromaticity. The molecule in question, **CCCCCO (1-pentanol)**, is a linear aliphatic alcohol with a hydroxyl group (-OH) at the end of a 5-carbon chain.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aliphatic alcohols**: 
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1 (cycloheptanol)**: Property = -0.69658239  
     This is a cyclic alcohol with a larger ring, showing a moderately negative value.
   - **CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1 (tert-butylbenzene)**: Property = -3.59676261  
     This is a non-polar aromatic with bulky aliphatic substitution, showing a highly negative value.
   - **CCC(C)Cl (2-chlorobutane)**: Property = 0.36274807  
     This is a simple halogenated alkane, showing a positive value.

2. **Polarity and chain length**: 
   - Longer aliphatic chains tend to have more negative values (e.g., **CCCCCCCI** = -3.9362095), while polar groups like -OH or -Cl can increase the value.

3. **CCCCCO (1-pentanol)**:
   - It has a polar -OH group but a relatively short aliphatic chain (5 carbons). 
   - Compared to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol, -0.69658239), 1-pentanol is less cyclic and less bulky, but similarly polar.
   - Compared to **CCC(C)Cl** (0.36274807), 1-pentanol is less polar than a halogen but more polar than a pure hydrocarbon.

### Prediction:
Given these trends, **CCCCCO** is expected to have a property value between the moderately negative value of cycloheptanol and the slightly positive value of 2-chlorobutane. The -OH group will pull the value up compared to pure hydrocarbons, but the short chain limits its impact.

**Estimated property value for CCCCO: ~ -0.5 to -0.3**

A reasonable specific prediction based on the examples would be:  
**-0.45** (similar to or slightly higher than cycloheptanol due to the linear -OH group). 

However, looking more closely, **CCC(C)Cl** (0.36274807) is a fair comparison for polarity, but 1-pentanol is less polar than a chloride. Adjusting downward, a better estimate might be closer to **-0.4**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.40** (approximate, based on analogous examples).

Iteration: 61
SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 0.12035462667225826
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as functional groups, aromaticity, polarity, and structural complexity. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:**  
`CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1`

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic ring (c2ccccc2):** Contributes negatively to the property (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2` has a value of -0.458).  
2. **Sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)):** Often increases the property (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of 0.355).  
3. **Amide group (C(=O)N):** Tends to decrease the property (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1` has a value of -1.044).  
4. **Heterocyclic ring (CCO1 with S=O and C=C):** Likely increases the property due to polarity and rigidity.  
5. **Methyl group (CC1):** Neutral or slightly negative influence.  

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- The sulfonyl group and heterocycle suggest a higher value (similar to phosphorothioates like `CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C` with 1.195).  
- The aromatic ring and amide group pull the value down (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2` is -0.458).  
- The overall balance suggests a moderately positive value.  

### Predicted property value:  
**0.75** (similar to molecules with sulfonyl groups and aromatic systems).  

This aligns with the trend where polar/rigid functional groups increase the property, while aromaticity and amides decrease it. The exact value is estimated based on the examples.

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 1.0886106271619251
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂, halogens)** tend to have higher (less negative) property values. For example:
   - `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` (large conjugated system) → **1.54353199**
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (highly chlorinated) → **1.04003716**
   - `c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2` (simple aromatic with NH) → **-0.69310759**

2. **Aliphatic chains or non-conjugated systems** tend to have lower (more negative) values unless functionalized with polar groups. For example:
   - `CCCCC` → **0.09733876**
   - `CCC(C)(C)CC` → **-0.26691005**

3. **Nitro groups (NO₂)** often increase the property value (less negative):
   - `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` → **-0.63484478** (still negative due to lack of other strong features)
   - `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` (two NO₂ + CF₃) → **0.67393481**

4. **Esters (COOR) and carbonyls (C=O)** can contribute to higher values:
   - `CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC` (diester) → **1.73090526**
   - `CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (ketone + steroidal) → **1.19766443**

5. **Fused aromatic systems with polar groups** can have intermediate values:
   - `O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23` → **0.54620274**

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The given molecule has:
- A **fused aromatic system** (`c2ccccc2` attached to a 6-membered ring).
- **Two ester groups** (`C(=O)OC` and `COC(=O)`).
- A **nitro group** (`N(=O)=O`).
- A **methyl group** (`C(C)`).
- A **double bond conjugated with the aromatic system** (`C1=C(C)NC=C`).

This structure is highly polar and conjugated, with strong electron-withdrawing groups (esters and NO₂) and aromaticity. Comparing to similar examples:
- The presence of **two esters + nitro + fused aromatic** is reminiscent of molecules with values in the **0.5 to 1.5 range**.
- The nitro-aromatic + ester combination is similar to `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` (0.67393481), but with more conjugation here.
- The fused aromatic + ester is similar to `OC4=C(C1CCC(CC1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(=O)c3ccccc3C4=O` (1.44454421), though that has additional rings.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing effects and conjugation, the value is likely in the **higher range of the examples**, but not as extreme as the largest values (e.g., 1.73090526 for the long-chain diester). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.1227778**  
*(This aligns with the upper-middle range of the examples, similar to molecules like `CCN2c1nc(N(C)(CCO))ccc1NC(=O)c3cccnc23` which has nitro-like features and aromaticity.)*

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.17637822219031574
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). The amide groups are part of a cyclic structure (a diketopiperazine-like core).
2. **Polarity**: The presence of two amides suggests moderate polarity, but the cyclopropane ring adds some rigidity and reduces flexibility.
3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., amides, carbonyls) often have property values in the range of **0.5 to 1.5** (e.g., **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** has **1.340**).
   - Cyclic amides (e.g., **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O**) have values around **0.701**.
   - Rigid structures with polar groups tend to have higher values than flexible aliphatic chains.

### Prediction:
Given the cyclic amide structure and rigidity, the property value is likely in the **0.6 to 0.8** range. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.68**  

This aligns with similar cyclic polar structures in the examples.
==================================================
Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 0.8044155262100751
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **ClCC** (chloroethane, or ethyl chloride) by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Comparison to similar molecules**:
   - **CCCC** (butane) has a property value of **0.38576308**.
   - **CCC** (propane) is not in the dataset, but **CCCCC** (pentane) has a value of **0.38576308**, suggesting alkanes have values around **0.38–0.39**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) has a value of **-0.02234793**, indicating that adding a chlorine atom to a benzene ring slightly reduces the property compared to pure hydrocarbons.
   - **CC#N** (acetonitrile) has a value of **0.99720532**, but this is a nitrile, which is quite different from chloroethane.

2. **Effect of chlorine substitution**:
   - Chlorine tends to reduce the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons (e.g., chlorobenzene vs. benzene, which isn't in the dataset but would likely be higher).
   - In **ClCC**, the chlorine is attached to a small alkane (ethane), which is simpler than chlorobenzene. The effect might be less pronounced than in aromatic systems.

3. **Size and simplicity**:
   - **ClCC** is a very small molecule, and small halogenated alkanes might not follow the same trends as larger or aromatic systems. However, the presence of chlorine likely lowers the value compared to **CCC** (propane, hypothetical) or **CCCC** (butane).

4. **Estimate**:
   - If **CCCC** is ~0.385, adding a chlorine might reduce the value by ~0.2–0.4, similar to the reduction seen in chlorobenzene (-0.022 vs. benzene, which would likely be ~0.7 based on other aromatics).
   - For **ClCC**, I'd estimate a value roughly halfway between **CCCC** and **Clc1ccccc1**, but slightly higher due to the simpler structure.

### Predicted property for **ClCC**: **~0.15**

This is a rough estimate, but based on the examples, a reasonable prediction would be in the range of **0.1 to 0.2**. For specificity, I'll predict:

**Predicted value: 0.18**
==================================================
Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: -9.380146833223609
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2**: -1.61210487 (chlorinated biphenyl)
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2**: -0.94789078 (chlorinated biphenyl)
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl**: 0.07830232 (polychlorinated biphenyl)
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl**: -0.76540296 (hexachlorinated with nitro group)
   - **Clc1cccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: 0.97346467 (polychlorinated with CCl3 group)

2. **Trichloromethyl (CCl3) Group**:
   - The presence of **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (trichloromethyl) tends to increase the property value, especially when attached to an aromatic system. For example:
     - **Clc1cccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: 0.97346467
     - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O**: 0.54064377

3. **Nitrogen in Aromatic Ring**:
   - A nitrogen in the aromatic ring (e.g., pyridine-like structures) often reduces the property value slightly, but the effect is overshadowed by strong electron-withdrawing groups like CCl3.
   - Example: **c2ccc1ocnc1c2**: -0.23460522 (nitrogen in a fused ring).

4. **Combined Effects**:
   - The molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has:
     - A chlorinated aromatic ring (similar to examples with property values around -0.9 to 0.9).
     - A trichloromethyl group (CCl3), which tends to push the value toward the positive side (as seen in examples with CCl3).
     - A nitrogen in the aromatic ring (pyridine-like), which may slightly reduce the value.

### Prediction:
Given the strong influence of the **CCl3** group (which tends to increase the property value) and the moderate influence of the chlorinated aromatic system, the property value is likely in the **positive range but not extremely high**. 

Comparing with similar structures:
- **Clc1cccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: 0.97346467 (similar CCl3 and aromatic system).
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl**: 0.07830232 (less chlorination than our molecule).

The nitrogen in the ring may slightly reduce the value compared to purely carbocyclic systems, but the **CCl3** group dominates. 

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** is approximately **0.65**. 

This is based on:
- The strong positive contribution from **CCl3** (as seen in other examples).
- The slight reduction due to the nitrogen in the ring.
- The chlorinated aromatic system's intermediate effect. 

Thus, the answer is:  
**0.65** (estimated range: 0.6 to 0.7).

Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.003620153594649705
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (which is 2-hexanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (3-heptanol): Property value = **-0.40927309**
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (1-phenylethanol): Property value = **-0.54521394**
   - **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol): Property value = **0.0**
   - **CCC(CC)CO** (3-methyl-1-pentanol): Property value = **0.0**

   Alcohols generally have property values in the range of **-0.5 to 0.0**, with primary alcohols (e.g., CCC(C)CCO) tending toward **0.0** and secondary alcohols (e.g., CCCC(O)CCC) being slightly more negative.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer carbon chains or branching (e.g., CCC(C)CCO vs. CCCC(O)CCC) do not show a clear trend in the given examples, but secondary alcohols seem slightly more negative than primary alcohols.

3. **CCCCC(C)O (2-hexanol)**:
   - This is a **secondary alcohol** with a 6-carbon chain, similar to **CCCC(O)CCC** (3-heptanol, 7-carbon chain, secondary alcohol, property = **-0.40927309**).
   - The property value for 2-hexanol should be close to this, but slightly less negative due to the shorter chain (6 vs. 7 carbons).

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CCCC(O)CCC** (-0.409) but with one fewer carbon, I predict the property value for **CCCCC(C)O** to be slightly less negative, around **-0.35**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.35** (estimated based on trends in the data).

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **-0.33648783**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (a biphenyl with chlorine substituents) has a value of **-0.33648783** (same as 1,4-dichlorobenzene, suggesting symmetry matters).
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (symmetrical dichlorophenol) has a value of **-0.67127911**, indicating that adding an OH group lowers the value further.

2. **Bromine vs. Chlorine**:
   - **CI** (iodomethane) has a value of **0.65137868**, but this is not directly comparable due to being an alkyl iodide.
   - No direct examples of brominated aromatics are provided, but bromine is heavier and more polarizable than chlorine, which may slightly increase the property value compared to chlorine analogs.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution**:
   - Symmetrical disubstituted aromatics (e.g., 1,4-dichlorobenzene) tend to have moderate negative values.
   - The presence of bromine (heavier halogen) might increase the value slightly compared to chlorine due to greater polarizability.

### Prediction for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 (1,4-dibromobenzene):
- Structurally similar to 1,4-dichlorobenzene (**Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**, **-0.33648783**), but with bromine instead of chlorine.
- Bromine is more polarizable and larger, which could lead to a slightly higher (less negative) property value.
- No strong electron-withdrawing or donating groups are present, so the value should remain close to the chloro analog but adjusted for bromine's effects.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, I predict the property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** to be slightly higher (less negative) than 1,4-dichlorobenzene. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.25**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or additional data would be needed.)

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 0.8577269427859634
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, particularly the degree of halogenation (chlorination or bromination) and aromaticity. The property values tend to increase with more halogen atoms and larger, more conjugated systems.

Let's analyze the given molecule:  
**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**  

This is a highly chlorinated biphenyl-like structure with two benzene rings connected, each heavily substituted with chlorine atoms. Here's the breakdown:
- Total chlorine atoms: **7**  
- Aromatic rings: **2** (biphenyl core)  
- Conjugation: Extended across both rings due to the biphenyl linkage and halogen substitution.  

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
1. **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property = **1.47091699**):  
   - This is a hexachlorinated biphenyl with **12 chlorine atoms** (very high halogenation).  
   - The given molecule has **7 chlorine atoms**, which is fewer but still significant.  

2. **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** (property = **1.06373116**):  
   - This is a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with **no halogens**, but high conjugation.  
   - The given molecule has less conjugation but compensates with heavy chlorination.  

3. **ClC(Br)Br** (property = **0.25027491**):  
   - A simple trihalomethane with **3 halogens**, much smaller than the given molecule.  

### Prediction:
The given molecule is intermediate in complexity between the highly chlorinated biphenyl (1.47) and the non-halogenated PAH (1.06). With **7 chlorines** and a biphenyl core, I would expect its property value to be **slightly lower than 1.47091699** but higher than 1.06373116.  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value = ~1.35**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured—e.g., logP, polarizability, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend of increasing values with halogenation and aromaticity.)  

Would you like to refine this further with additional context about the property?

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 1.4962960068342634
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and polarity. The molecule in question is:

**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

This is a relatively large, aromatic-rich molecule with a central phosphate group (P=O) linking two aromatic rings (one with a methyl substituent and another with a methyl substituent on a phenyl ring). The presence of the phosphate group (polar, hydrogen-bonding) and multiple aromatic rings (hydrophobic, bulky) suggests moderate polarity but significant steric hindrance.

Looking at similar molecules in the examples:
- Molecules with phosphate groups (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O`) have values around **1.33**.
- Aromatic-rich molecules with polar substituents (e.g., `Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1`) have values around **1.28**.
- The phosphate group here is less sterically hindered than in some examples, but the bulky aromatic substituents may offset this.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for **Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1** is likely in the range of **1.1 to 1.3**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: 1.25**

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.12976476772143022
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: The presence of **CF3** (a highly electronegative and lipophilic group) is seen in some of the provided examples, such as:
   - `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C` (property = 0.20715507)
   - This group tends to increase the property value slightly due to its electron-withdrawing nature and hydrophobicity.

2. **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The molecule has a benzene ring with a **CF3** and a **N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O** substituent. The latter is a complex heterocyclic group with:
   - A **pyrrolidinone-like ring (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O)** with two chlorine atoms and a ketone. Chlorine substituents are present in many of the provided examples and generally increase the property value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a high value of 1.04003716).

3. **Polar functional groups**: The **N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O** group introduces polarity (amide-like character) and halogenated (Cl) steric bulk, which can moderately increase the property value.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- The molecule `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` (multiple Cl substituents) has a property value of **0.78971552**.
- The molecule `COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (aromatic + Cl and OMe groups) has a value of **1.07928067**.
- The molecule `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C` (CF3 + polar groups) has a value of **0.20715507**.

Given the combination of **CF3**, **aromatic ring**, and **chlorinated heterocycle**, the property value is likely in the **moderate-positive range**, similar to molecules with multiple halogens and polar groups.

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the above, a reasonable estimate for **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O** is:

**0.65** (approximate, likely between 0.5 and 0.8 based on structural similarity to the given examples). 

For a more precise prediction, statistical modeling or QSAR would be needed, but this is a reasonable heuristic estimate.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.8784952948336319
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **methyl nitrophenyl ether** (or **nitroanisole**), with the structure:
- A benzene ring with:
  - A methoxy group (**-OCH3**) at one position.
  - A nitro group (**-NO2**) at another position (meta, ortho, or para; exact position unspecified but likely para given the SMILES notation).

### Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Nitrogen-Containing Aromatic Compounds**:
   - `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(N=CNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` has a value of **-0.396**.
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (dinitrobenzene) has a value of **-0.894**.
   - Nitro groups tend to decrease the property value (more negative).

2. **Ether-Linked Aromatics**:
   - `Oc1ccccc1O` (hydroquinone) has a value of **0.212**.
   - `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (dimethyl phthalate) has a value of **-4.342**, but this is an ester, not a simple ether.
   - Ethers (e.g., **-OCH3**) alone may not strongly influence the property unless combined with other groups.

3. **Combined Substituents**:
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which may lower the property value.
   - The methoxy group is electron-donating, which may counteract the nitro group's effect slightly.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol) has a value of **0.212**.
   - Adding a nitro group (as in `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`) reduces the value to **-0.894**.
   - The methoxy group in **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is less polar than a hydroxyl group, so the nitro group's effect may dominate.

### Prediction:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group and the moderate electron-donating effect of the methoxy group, the property value is likely **negative but less extreme** than dinitrobenzene. A reasonable estimate is between **-0.4 and -0.7**.

From the examples:
- `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(N=CNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` (complex nitro/heterocyclic) is **-0.396**.
- `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (dinitrobenzene) is **-0.894**.

For **mono-nitro with methoxy**, a plausible value is **-0.55**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is **-0.55**.

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.8292227703913823
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl)Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Polycyclic Structure**: The molecule is a heavily chlorinated polycyclic hydrocarbon, similar to **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (hexachlorocyclohexane, property value: **-0.80670525**). Both have multiple chlorine atoms attached to a rigid cyclic framework.
2. **Increased Chlorination**: The given molecule has even more chlorine substituents (9 Cl atoms) than hexachlorocyclohexane (6 Cl atoms). Higher halogenation typically reduces the property value further due to increased steric and electronic effects.
3. **Steric Hindrance and Polarity**: The bulky chlorine atoms introduce significant steric hindrance and polarity, which likely lowers the property value compared to less halogenated or non-halogenated analogs.
4. **Comparison to Other Halogenated Examples**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane): **0.58109927** (simpler, less halogenated).
   - **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (pentachlorophenol): **-5.09537436** (highly chlorinated aromatic, very low value).
   - The given molecule is aliphatic but more chlorinated than hexachlorocyclohexane, so its value should be lower than **-0.80670525** but not as extreme as pentachlorophenol.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, the property value for **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl** is likely in the range of **-1.5 to -2.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: -1.892**  

### Rationale:
- The molecule's extreme chlorination and polycyclic rigidity suggest a significant reduction in the property value compared to simpler chlorinated alkanes.
- It is less aromatic than pentachlorophenol (which has a very low value), so its value is not as extreme but still strongly negative.
- The closest analog (hexachlorocyclohexane, **-0.8067**) is surpassed in halogenation, justifying a lower value.  

This prediction aligns with the observed trend that increased halogenation and structural complexity reduce the property value.

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.5385681491759768
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NO₂, -Br, -Cl, -NH₂) tend to have negative property values.
   - Nonpolar or weakly polar groups (e.g., alkyl chains, halogens without strong electron-withdrawing effects) often lead to less negative or positive values.
   - Esters (e.g., COO) and carbonyls (C=O) can vary but often have moderately negative values unless balanced by other features.

2. **Size and Complexity**:
   - Larger, more complex molecules (e.g., sugars, polycyclic systems) tend to have more extreme values (either highly positive or negative).
   - Small, simple molecules (e.g., CCCI, CC#N) often have values closer to zero or slightly positive.

3. **Specific Examples**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate): Highly negative (-3.043) due to the combination of ester and amine.
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2**: Positive (0.916) due to the ether and ester in a larger system.
   - **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate): Not explicitly listed, but similar esters with small alkyl groups have values around -0.5 to -1.0.

### Analysis of **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate):
- It is a small ester with a propyl group and a formyl (C=O) group.
- Compared to ethyl acetate (a similar ester), it has one more carbon in the alkyl chain, which may slightly reduce polarity but not drastically.
- No strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups are present, so the value should be moderately negative.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, I predict the property value for **CCCOC=O** to be approximately **-0.65**. This is based on:
- Similarity to other small esters in the dataset (e.g., **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** is -3.04, but without the amine, the value would be less negative).
- The balance between the polar C=O and the nonpolar propyl group.

### Final Answer:
**-0.65** (estimated range: -0.5 to -0.8).

Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.6248339560149843
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Chain Length**: 
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** with a value of **-1.43221004**) tend to have moderately negative values. 
   - Shorter chains (e.g., **CC** with a value of **0.99506271**) have positive values.
   - The presence of aromatic rings often reduces the property value (e.g., **c1ccccc1NC(=O)c2c(O)cccc2** has **-0.27891544**).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Esters (e.g., COCC(=O)N(...))** tend to have positive values (e.g., **0.63784671**).
   - **Alcohols (e.g., Oc1ccc(O)cc1)** have near-neutral or slightly positive values (**0.1004389**).
   - **Carboxylic acids or derivatives** (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)C**) have negative values (**-0.37265692**).

3. **Polarity**:
   - Highly polar or halogenated molecules (e.g., **Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br**) have negative values (**-0.89392587**).
   - Nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., **CC**) have high positive values (**0.99506271**).

### Analysis of **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is a **long aliphatic chain (10 carbons)** with an **ester group (C(=O)OCC)**.
- The long hydrophobic chain would typically reduce the property value, but the ester group (which often increases the value) counteracts this.
- Similar molecules in the examples:
  - **COCC(=O)N(...)** has **0.63784671** (ester with aromatic).
  - **CC(=O)C3CCC4...** has **1.19766443** (ketone with aliphatic/cyclic).
  - **CCCOC** (simple ether) has **0.54553039**.

Given the long aliphatic chain and the ester group, the property value is likely **moderately positive**, balancing the hydrophobic effect of the chain with the polar contribution of the ester.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.45** (estimated based on the ester's positive contribution and the chain's slight negative effect). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data.)

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.74516725902808
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol group (Oc1ccc...)**: Phenolic groups (e.g., **Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1** with property **-2.342**) tend to lower the property value, but substitution can modulate this.
2. **Chlorine substituents (Cl)**: Chlorine atoms (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** with **-0.668**) often reduce the property, but not drastically.
3. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N...)**: Amides (e.g., **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** with **-0.323**) typically contribute moderately negative values.
4. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Nitro groups (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** with **-0.668**) are strongly electron-withdrawing and reduce the property.
5. **Aromatic systems**: The presence of multiple aromatic rings (e.g., **c1ccccc1** with **0.314**) can increase the property, but substituents dominate.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: Property = **-0.668** (chloro-nitrobenzene).
- **NC(=O)c1ccccc1**: Property = **-0.323** (benzamide).
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: Property = **-0.655** (chlorophenol).
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)c1ccccc1**: Property = **-0.525** (cyclic amide with aromatic).

The given molecule combines:
- A chlorophenol moiety (similar to **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1**, **-0.655**).
- An amide linkage (similar to **NC(=O)c1ccccc1**, **-0.323**).
- A nitro group (similar to **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, **-0.668**).

### Prediction:
The combined effects of the phenol, chloro, amide, and nitro groups suggest a property value more negative than simple chloro-nitrobenzene but less extreme than highly polar or polycyclic systems (e.g., **-2.342**). 

Given the additive effects:
- Base: Chlorophenol (**-0.655**).
- Add amide (**~ -0.3 contribution**).
- Add nitro (**~ -0.6 contribution**).

A reasonable estimate is **-1.2 to -1.5**. 

Looking at similar complex molecules:
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC**: **-0.721** (cyclic amide with alkyl).
- **COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1**: **-1.447** (polyhydroxy ester).

The presence of **two chlorines and a nitro group** pushes the value further negative. 

### Final Prediction:
**-1.45** (close to **COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1** but slightly less negative due to the aromatic stabilization). 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**-1.45** (approximate). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend of substituent effects in the given data.)

Iteration: 76
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 1.752930144717775
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as:  
- **Polarity/functional groups**: Presence of polar groups (e.g., carbonyls, hydroxyls, halogens) tends to increase the property value.  
- **Aromaticity**: Aromatic rings often contribute positively but can vary with substitutions.  
- **Halogens (Cl, Br, F)**: Chlorine and bromine substitutions, especially multiple ones, often increase the value (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl` = -1.18, but more complex polyhalogenated structures like `ClC1(C(=O)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C14Cl)C5(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C45Cl` = 1.08).  
- **Phosphorothioate groups (P(=S))**: These appear to significantly increase the property value (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` = 1.28).  
- **Size/branching**: Larger, more complex molecules with combined polar/halogenated/aromatic features tend to have higher values.  

### Target Molecule:  
**`COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1`**  
- Contains **two phosphorothioate (P(=S)) groups**, which are strongly associated with higher property values in the examples.  
- Has **aromatic rings** linked by a **thioether (S) bridge**, similar to some examples with aromatic systems (though sulfur bridges are less common in the training data).  
- No halogens, but the **P(=S) groups dominate** the polarity/electronic effects.  

### Prediction:  
Given the strong positive contribution of P(=S) groups (e.g., 1.28 for a single P(=S) with Cl-aromatic), and the presence of **two such groups** here, the value should be **higher than 1.28** but tempered by the lack of halogens.  

**Predicted property value: ~1.45**  
(Reasoning: The second P(=S) group likely adds less than the first due to diminishing returns, but the combined effect is still significant.)  

---  
*Note: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, binding affinity), this is an empirical estimate based on trends in the data. The highest values in the examples (~1.28) involve P(=S) + Cl-aromatic, so this molecule’s dual P(=S) + aromaticity likely places it slightly above that.*

Iteration: 77
SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.30422982097365264
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2**: Property = **0.2585225**
     - This molecule has a nitro group attached to a phenyl ring (similar to our target molecule) and additional chloro substituents. The property is positive but relatively small.
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: Property = **-0.63484478**
     - Here, the nitro group is attached to a toluene (methyl-substituted benzene), and the property is negative.

2. **Presence of Hydroxy Group (OH)**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O**: Property = **-0.4946276**
     - A hydroxy group on benzene with an amide substituent gives a negative value.
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = **-1.53308279**
     - A hydroxy group with multiple chloro substituents gives a highly negative value.

3. **Combined Nitro and Hydroxy Groups**:
   - Our target molecule has both a hydroxy and a nitro group on the same benzene ring (ortho, meta, or para position). From the examples:
     - Nitro alone (on toluene) gives **-0.63484478**.
     - Hydroxy with other groups tends to reduce the property (more negative).
     - The nitro group seems to have a less negative effect when paired with other polar groups (e.g., in **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2**, the property is positive).

### Prediction:
The molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol) has:
- A hydroxy group (tends to reduce the property).
- A nitro group (can increase or decrease depending on context).
- No other bulky or strongly electron-withdrawing/donating groups.

Given that:
- Nitro on toluene gives **-0.63484478**.
- Hydroxy on benzene with other groups gives values around **-0.5 to -1.5**.
- The nitro group here is likely para or ortho to the hydroxy group, which may slightly mitigate the negative effect.

### Estimated Property:
A reasonable prediction is between **-0.4 and -0.7**. Averaging the effects, I predict:

**Predicted property value: -0.55**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or additional data would be needed.)

- Molecules with many polar groups (e.g., hydroxyls, amines) tend to have property values in the mid-range (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has a value of `0.08588001`).
- Larger, more complex polar molecules (e.g., steroids or sugars) often have values between `0.5` and `1.5`, depending on the balance of polar/nonpolar regions.
- The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages in this sugar suggests significant polarity and hydrogen bonding, but the sheer size and branching may moderate the value.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for:
`OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O`

would likely be in the range of **`0.4` to `0.8`**. A reasonable estimate is **`0.65`**, considering its similarity to other polar, polyhydroxylated structures in the dataset (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` at `0.085`, but scaled up for size/complexity). 

**Final predicted value: `0.65`** (rounded to match the precision of the examples).

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.6883541753859564
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that might correlate with the property in question. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkynes and Nitriles**: 
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (a dinitrile compound) has a property value of **-0.41435235**.
   - The presence of triple bonds (C#C or C#N) seems to contribute to negative property values, though the exact magnitude depends on other structural features.

2. **Hydrocarbon Chains**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (a linear alcohol) has a value of **-0.40927309**.
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (a long-chain alcohol) has a value of **0.43986433**.
   - **CCCC(=O)C** (a ketone) has a value of **0.36371755**.
   - **CCC(C)C(=O)C** (a branched ketone) has a value of **0.0747751**.
   - **CCCCCC=O** (an aldehyde) has a value of **0.0697869**.
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (an alkene) has a surprisingly low value of **-5.26721844**, which seems like an outlier or suggests that unsaturation (double bonds) in long chains may drastically reduce the property value.

3. **Simple Alkynes**:
   - The given examples do not include simple alkynes like **CCC#C**, but we can infer from the trends that:
     - Triple bonds (like in **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N**) tend to reduce the property value compared to single bonds.
     - Shorter chains with triple bonds may have moderately negative values.

4. **Other Functional Groups**:
   - Halogens (Cl, F, Br, I) tend to reduce the property value (e.g., **Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** has **-1.17987475**).
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro groups) also reduce the value (e.g., **Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** has **-0.63484478**).

### Prediction for **CCC#C**:
- **CCC#C** is a simple alkyne with no other functional groups. 
- Compared to **CCCC(O)CCC** (value **-0.40927309**), the triple bond in **CCC#C** would likely make the property more negative, but not as extreme as the long-chain alkene (**-5.26721844**).
- The dinitrile example (**N#Cc1ccccc1C#N**, **-0.41435235**) suggests that triple bonds contribute to negative values, but the aromatic ring and second nitrile may also play a role.
- Given the simplicity of **CCC#C**, a reasonable estimate would be slightly more negative than **CCCC(O)CCC** but less negative than the dinitrile compound.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CCC#C** is approximately **-0.50**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, dipole moment, or another molecular descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trends in the provided data.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 0.7183142384909451
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as:

1. **Polarity and functional groups**: Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -N=O, halogens) tend to have more negative or positive values depending on their arrangement.
2. **Aromaticity**: Aromatic rings often contribute to the property value, with substitutions (e.g., halogens, -OCH3) modulating it.
3. **Size and branching**: Larger or more complex structures (e.g., polycyclic systems) tend to have higher absolute values.
4. **Electron-withdrawing/donating groups**: These can shift the property positively or negatively (e.g., nitro groups vs. alkyl chains).
5. **Phosphorus/sulfur-containing groups**: These often contribute positively to the property (e.g., P=O, P=S, S=O).

### Analysis of the target molecule:
**CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**

1. **Structure**:
   - Contains a **P=S** (thiophosphate) group, which is electron-withdrawing and often contributes positively (e.g., see `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` with value **1.28369402**).
   - Aromatic ring with **three chlorine substitutions** (electron-withdrawing). Compare to `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (value **0.85772694**) and `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl` (value **-1.17987475**). The more Cl substitutions, the higher the value tends to be.
   - Ethoxy (**CCO-**) and ethyl (**CC-**) groups are weakly electron-donating but not as impactful as halogens or P=S.

2. **Analogous examples**:
   - `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (value **1.28369402**) has P=S and Cl substitutions.
   - `Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` (value **0.2585225**) has Cl and ether-linked aromatic rings.
   - The P=S group likely dominates, pushing the value toward the higher end.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The P=S group and three Cl substitutions suggest a **positive value**, likely between **0.8 and 1.3**.
   - The lack of additional strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2) or donating groups (e.g., OH) tempers the effect slightly compared to the highest examples.
   - The closest analog is `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (1.283), but with fewer polar groups, the value may be slightly lower.

### Final predicted property value:
**1.04623096**  
*(This aligns with the trend for P=S + Cl-substituted aromatics, similar to other examples in the dataset.)*

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.41627771494792454
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (c1nccc)** with a **hydrazide group (C(=O)NN)** attached. 
   - The pyridine ring is aromatic and polar due to the nitrogen.
   - The hydrazide group is highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (donor and acceptor).

2. **Key Observations from Examples**:
   - Molecules with polar/heteroatom-rich groups (e.g., amides, nitro, halogens) tend to have negative property values (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1Cl: -0.413`, `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1: -0.634`).
   - Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `Nc1cccc2ccccc12: -6.323`) show very negative values, though this is an extreme outlier.
   - The presence of **C(=O)NN** (hydrazide) is similar to amides/carbamates, which often correlate with negative values (e.g., `c1ccccc1(OC(=O)NC): -1.189`).

3. **Comparison to Closest Examples**:
   - `Nc1ccccc1Cl` (aniline + chloro): **-0.413**
   - `COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1` (polar heterocycle with amides): **-0.154**
   - `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (aromatic + amine): **-6.323** (outlier, likely due to fused rings).
   - The hydrazide group here is more polar than a simple amide, suggesting a moderately negative value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the polarity of the hydrazide group and the pyridine ring, the value is likely **negative** and more extreme than simple halogenated aromatics but less extreme than fused polyaromatics. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property: -0.85**  

This balances the effects of the polar hydrazide and the aromatic pyridine, aligning with trends in the provided data.

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 1.2672449317958212
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: Present in the molecule. In the examples, molecules with P(=S) or similar groups (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**) have property values around **0.068**. This suggests that the P(=S) group may contribute a slightly positive or neutral value.
2. **Thioether Linkage (SCC(=O))**: The presence of sulfur (S) in a non-polar environment (e.g., **CCS**) is associated with positive values (e.g., **0.670**). However, when combined with polar groups, the effect may be moderated.
3. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: Amides (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C**) tend to have negative or near-zero values (e.g., **-0.127**). Here, the amide is part of a cyclic structure, which may slightly alter its contribution.
4. **Alkyl Chains (CCCC, OCCC)**: Long alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCI**) are associated with negative values (e.g., **-3.936**), but shorter chains or branched structures (e.g., **CC(C)C(O)C(C)C**) have less negative values (e.g., **-0.395**). The chains here are moderate in length.
5. **Cyclic Structure (N1CCCCC1C)**: Cyclohexane-like structures (e.g., **C/C1CCC(\C)CC1**) have values around **-0.514**. The inclusion of a nitrogen and methyl group may slightly increase this value.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**: Property = **0.068** (contains P(=S), aromatic, and nitro groups).
- **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C**: Property = **-0.127** (amide group).
- **CCS**: Property = **0.670** (thioether).
- **C/C1CCC(\C)CC1**: Property = **-0.514** (cyclohexane).

### Synthesis of Features:
The molecule combines:
- A **phosphorothioate group** (likely contributing a small positive value).
- A **thioether linkage** (positive contribution, but moderated by adjacent polar groups).
- An **amide group in a cyclic structure** (slightly negative contribution).
- **Alkyl chains** (neutral to slightly negative contribution).

Given these competing effects, the net property value is likely to be **slightly positive**, similar to molecules like **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1 (0.068)** but potentially higher due to the thioether and longer alkyl chains.

### Predicted Property:
**0.45** (approximate, based on the balance of structural contributions). 

This is a rough estimate given the complexity of the molecule and the limited examples with exact matching functional groups. For higher precision, a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model or additional data would be needed.

Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.793039988202186
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The property seems to correlate with molecular size, polarity, functional groups, and aromaticity. 

For the molecule **CCCCCCCC** (octane), which is a linear alkane with no functional groups or aromaticity, we can compare it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol) has a property value of **-0.41154186**. This molecule is similar but has a polar hydroxyl group, which likely reduces the property value compared to the pure hydrocarbon.
2. **CCCC/C=C/C** (an unsaturated hydrocarbon) has a property value of **-0.26469446**. The presence of a double bond slightly increases the property value compared to a saturated hydrocarbon.
3. **CCCCCC** (hexane, though not explicitly in the dataset) would be expected to have a lower property value than heptanol but higher than more polar or functionalized molecules.

Since **CCCCCCCC** is a longer, purely aliphatic hydrocarbon with no polar groups or unsaturation, its property value should be slightly higher than **CCCC/C=C/C** but lower than small polar molecules. 

Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **CCCCCCCC** is:

**Predicted property value: -0.35**  

This is based on interpolation between the values for similar molecules in the dataset, accounting for the lack of functional groups and increased chain length.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 1.053135474951878
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure features. The molecule in question is:

**CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a multi-ring structure similar to steroids (e.g., **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O**, property = 0.88779168).
2. **Carbonyl group (C=O)**: The presence of a ketone (C=O) tends to increase the property value (e.g., **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C**, property = 1.21143833).
3. **Hydroxyl groups (-OH)**: These also contribute positively (e.g., **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O**, property = 0.88779168).
4. **Alkyne group (C#C)**: This is less common in the examples, but terminal alkynes are polar and may slightly increase the property.
5. **Ring strain/rigidity**: The fused ring system likely contributes to a higher property value.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** (property = 0.88779168) is very similar but lacks the alkyne and has one fewer hydroxyl group.
- **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** (property = 1.21143833) has an additional carbonyl and hydroxyl group.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to the above examples and the presence of **two hydroxyl groups, one carbonyl, and an alkyne**, the property value is expected to be **slightly higher than 0.88779168 but lower than 1.21143833**. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**1.05** (rounded to two decimal places).  

### Exact Prediction:
Based on interpolation of the examples, the predicted property is:  
**1.098**.  

This aligns with the observed trend for steroid-like molecules with polar functional groups.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 2.1484275937375066
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and aromaticity. The molecule in question is:

**COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67**

### Observations:
1. **Structural Features**:
   - The molecule is highly complex, with multiple fused rings (aromatic and non-aromatic), ether linkages (OCH3, OCO), hydroxyl groups (OH), and a ketone (C=O).
   - It resembles polycyclic aromatic systems (e.g., naphthalene derivatives) and sugar-like moieties (e.g., furanose/pyranose rings), which often contribute to higher property values in the examples (e.g., `1.06373116` for polyaromatics).
   - The presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, alcohols, ketones) can influence the property, often lowering it slightly compared to pure hydrocarbons but not drastically (e.g., `-0.09422466` for `OCc1ccccc1` vs. `0.31416228` for `c1ccccc1`).

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The closest examples are large polycyclic systems with heteroatoms:
     - `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54` (property = `1.06373116`): A pure polyaromatic hydrocarbon.
     - `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` (property = `1.81310375`): A steroid-like structure with multiple rings and oxygen substituents.
   - This molecule is similarly large and oxygenated but lacks the pure aromaticity of the first example and the steroidal bulk of the second. It is more akin to a glycosylated flavonoid or lignan.

3. **Functional Group Contributions**:
   - Aromatic rings with ethers/alcohols (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` = `-0.15656388`) tend to have moderately negative values.
   - Fused polyaromatics (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45` = `1.00339066`) have positive values.
   - The presence of multiple O-heterocycles (e.g., `OCO` rings) may slightly reduce the property compared to pure aromatics.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between polyaromatic character (positive contribution) and oxygenated functional groups (slightly negative contribution), the property value is likely **positive but less than the pure polyaromatic examples**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.85**  
(Rationale: Closer to `1.00339066` but tempered by oxygen substituents.)

Iteration: 86
SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.15656388411901118
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol) has a property value of **-0.30422982**.
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (another nitrophenol) also has **-0.30422982**, showing consistency.
   - Phenol itself (not explicitly listed but implied) would likely have a value close to these, slightly less negative due to the absence of the electron-withdrawing nitro group.

2. **Chlorinated Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene) has **-1.81240408**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl) has **-0.33648783**.
   - **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (chloronaphthalene) has **-4.7375016**, but this is a fused ring system, which is less comparable.
   - **Fc1ccccc1** (fluorobenzene) has **0.3166468**, showing that halogens can have varying effects.

3. **Substituent Effects**:
   - The **-OH** group tends to make the property more negative (e.g., phenols are more negative than simple halobenzenes).
   - The **-Cl** group is electron-withdrawing but less so than **-NO2**, so we expect a value between phenol and nitrophenol.

4. **Direct Comparison**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: -0.30422982 (nitrophenol, strong electron-withdrawing -NO2).
   - **Oc1ccccc1Cl** should be more negative than nitrophenol because -Cl is less electron-withdrawing than -NO2, but the -OH group's influence remains. However, this seems counterintuitive (usually -NO2 is more electron-withdrawing than -Cl), so perhaps the property is not directly related to electron-withdrawing effects but another feature like hydrophobicity or sterics.

### Re-evaluating Trends:
Looking at other chlorophenols or similar systems:
- **Clc1ccccc1I**: -1.81240408 (chloroiodobenzene, no -OH).
- **Oc1ccccc1Cl** should be more negative than chloroiodobenzene due to the -OH group's contribution.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Phenol derivatives with -NO2 are around -0.30.
- Chlorobenzene derivatives are more negative (e.g., -1.81 for chloroiodobenzene).
- The presence of -OH and -Cl together (in 4-chlorophenol) would likely give a value between these, but closer to the phenol derivatives because -OH dominates.

A reasonable estimate is slightly more negative than nitrophenol but less negative than chloroiodobenzene. Thus, I predict:

**Predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl: -0.75** 

(This is close to **Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I** (-0.75068012), which has -OH and halogens, supporting this estimate.)

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -0.07102438161222774
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - **Chlorine atoms (Cl)**: Present at the terminal alkyne (ClCC#C-) and on the aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1). From the examples, Cl substituents can contribute both positively and negatively to the property value, depending on their environment (e.g., aromatic vs. aliphatic).
   - **Alkyne group (C#C)**: Rare in the examples, but similar to double bonds, which often reduce the property value slightly.
   - **Ester-like linkage (OC(=O)N)**: Similar to amide or ester groups, which often reduce the property value (e.g., COC(=O) in the example with -4.342).
   - **Aromatic ring with Cl substitution**: Similar to Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 or Clc1ccc(Cl)c1, which have property values around 0.857 to 1.040 when heavily chlorinated, but lower when less substituted.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The molecule has similarities to **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1** (property: ~0.857) but with additional polar/aliphatic groups (C#CCOC(=O)N) that may reduce the value.
   - The **OC(=O)N** group is similar to **O=C1N(COC(=O)...)** examples, which have positive values (~1.409 to 1.522), but here it's part of a smaller, less complex system.
   - The alkyne and aliphatic Cl might slightly reduce the value compared to purely aromatic Cl-substituted examples.

3. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is moderately polar due to Cl, C#C, and OC(=O)N, but not as large or complex as some high-value examples (e.g., steroids with property >1.5).
   - Smaller than the highly chlorinated examples with values ~0.8-1.0, but with additional polar features.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the balance of:
- Positive contributions from aromatic Cl substitution (~0.8-1.0),
- Negative contributions from alkyne and polar OC(=O)N (~-0.5 to -1.0),
- Overall moderate size and polarity,

The predicted property value is likely in the range of **0.2 to 0.6**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.45**

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 1.0430496325887002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a central carbon attached to:
   - A hydroxyl group (**OH**).
   - A chlorophenyl ring (**c1ccc(Cl)cc1**).
   - A pyrimidine-like heterocycle (**c2cncnc2**, resembling a pyrimidine or triazine).
   - Another chlorophenyl ring (**c3ccccc3Cl**).

2. **Key Features**:
   - Two aromatic rings (both with **Cl** substitution).
   - A heterocyclic ring (**c2cncnc2**) with nitrogen atoms, which may contribute to polarity or hydrogen bonding.
   - A polar hydroxyl group (**OH**), which can form hydrogen bonds.
   - Chlorine substituents, which are electronegative and may influence the property.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Chlorinated Aromatics**: 
  - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` has a property of **-0.47685279**.
  - `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` has a property of **0.97346467** (more chlorines and bulkier structure).
  - `Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc2Cl` has a property of **0.85772694** (highly chlorinated).
- **Heterocycles**:
  - `Nc1nc[nH]n1` has a property of **0.6118604** (similar to the **c2cncnc2** group here).
- **Hydroxyl Group**:
  - `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` has a property of **0.1004389** (polar but small).
- **Combined Features**:
  - The molecule is larger and more complex than most examples, with multiple polar/electronegative groups (OH, Cl, N-heterocycle). This suggests a balance between positive (bulkiness, heterocycle) and negative (Cl, OH) contributions.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of:
- Two chlorinated phenyl rings (similar to the higher chlorinated examples with values ~0.8–0.9).
- A polar heterocycle (contributing ~0.6).
- A hydroxyl group (contributing modest polarity).

The property value is likely **positive** due to the bulkiness and multiple electronegative substituents, but not as high as the most chlorinated examples. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.75** (range: 0.6 to 0.9). 

This aligns with the structural similarity to molecules like `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (0.973) but with slightly less contribution from the heterocycle and hydroxyl group.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with highly polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., nitro groups `N(=O)=O`, amides `C(=O)N`, or multiple halogens) tend to have more negative or positive values, depending on the context.
   - Ethers (`COC`) and esters (`COC=O`) often have intermediate values, but the exact value depends on the rest of the structure.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCCC=O`) tend to have values closer to zero unless paired with other functional groups.
   - Branching or cyclic structures can lower the value (e.g., `C1CCCCCCC1` has -0.529).

3. **Specific Examples for Comparison**:
   - `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl butyrate): **-0.02918456**  
     This is an ester with a 4-carbon chain and an ethoxy group, similar to butyl formate but with an extra carbon in the acyl part.
   - `CCCCCC=O` (heptanal): **0.0697869**  
     This is a linear aldehyde with a 6-carbon chain.
   - `CC(=O)OCC` (ethyl acetate): Not in the list, but structurally simpler than butyl formate and likely closer to zero.
   - `O=Cc1ccco1` (furan-2-carbaldehyde): **0.44619692**  
     This is an aromatic aldehyde, which is not directly comparable but shows that aldehydes can have positive values.

4. **Butyl Formate (CCCCOC=O)**:
   - This is a linear ester with a 4-carbon alkyl chain and a formate group (`OC=O`). 
   - Compared to `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl butyrate, -0.029), butyl formate has a shorter acyl chain (formate vs. butyrate), which might slightly increase the value (less negative).
   - Compared to `CCCCCC=O` (heptanal, 0.069), it replaces the aldehyde with an ester, which could slightly lower the value.

### Prediction:
Given these comparisons, the property value for **CCCCOC=O** is likely **close to zero but slightly positive**, similar to heptanal but adjusted for the ester group. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.05**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. If the property is something like logP or solubility, the reasoning would adjust accordingly.)

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.7971136249026308
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the given molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) in the context of the provided data.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Alkanes**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of **0.58109927**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene) has a property value of **-2.29331964**, but this is a highly chlorinated aromatic system, which is not directly comparable.
   - **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(NC=O)...** (a highly chlorinated and complex molecule) has a value of **1.09214977**, but this is not a simple chlorinated alkane.

2. **Simple Chlorinated Methanes**:
   - The closest simple chlorinated alkane is **ClCCCl**, with a value of **0.58109927**.
   - **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) is structurally simpler than **ClCCCl** but has similar electronegativity and polarity effects from the chlorine atoms.

3. **Trends**:
   - Smaller chlorinated alkanes tend to have positive property values (e.g., **ClCCCl** at 0.581, **CCBr** at 0.673).
   - Larger or more complex chlorinated molecules can have negative values (e.g., **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** at -2.293).

### Prediction for **ClCCl**:
- **ClCCl** is smaller and simpler than **ClCCCl**, but the presence of two chlorines will still contribute a similar electronic effect. 
- The property value is likely slightly lower than that of **ClCCCl** because of reduced size and fewer atoms contributing to the property. 
- A reasonable estimate would be slightly less than **0.58109927** but still positive.

### Predicted Property Value for **ClCCl**:
**0.45** (approximate, based on the trend and closest example). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data trends. The actual value could vary if the property depends on other factors not evident from the examples.)

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.6042712133374376
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Hydroxyl Group (-OH)**:
   - Molecules with a hydroxyl group (e.g., `Oc1cccc(O)c1`, `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O`) tend to have property values in the negative range or close to zero. 
     - `Oc1cccc(O)c1`: 0.1004389 (two -OH groups, slightly positive)
     - `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O`: -3.14139075 (one -OH, highly negative)
   - The position and substitution around the -OH group seem to influence the value significantly.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Alkyl Substitution**:
   - Aromatic rings with simple alkyl groups (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1`) often have values around zero or slightly negative.
   - Substitution with electron-donating groups (like -OH or -OCH3) can push the value more negative.

3. **Specific Example Similarity**:
   - The molecule `Cc1cccc(C)c1O` is structurally similar to `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (both are alkyl-substituted phenols with one -OH group). 
     - `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` has a value of -3.14139075.
   - However, `Cc1cccc(C)c1O` has less steric hindrance (methyl groups instead of a bulky isopropyl group), which might make the property value less negative.

4. **Other Phenol Examples**:
   - `Oc1ccccc1` (phenol) is not in the examples, but substituted phenols like `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (catechol) have a value of 0.1004389, suggesting that additional -OH groups can increase the value.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (-3.14139075) but with less steric hindrance (methyl instead of isopropyl), the property value for `Cc1cccc(C)c1O` is likely less negative but still in the negative range. 

A reasonable estimate would be between **-1.5 and -2.5**. Considering the examples, I predict:

**Predicted property value: -1.8** 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarity and trends in the data. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or experimental data would be necessary.)

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.39262042693743693
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Heavy Chlorination**: The molecule is highly chlorinated, with multiple chlorine atoms on two connected benzene rings (a biphenyl-like structure). 
   - Similar examples: 
     - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c2ccccc2)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property = 0.64577123)
     - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 0.85772694)
   - These show that heavily chlorinated aromatic systems tend to have positive property values in the range of **0.6–0.8**.

2. **Biphenyl Core**: The molecule consists of two benzene rings linked directly (biphenyl), similar to:
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24** (property = 0.73592312)
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (property = 1.00339066)
   - Biphenyl-like structures with substitutions tend to have property values in the **0.7–1.0** range.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution Pattern**: The chlorine atoms are symmetrically distributed, which may slightly increase the property value compared to asymmetric cases (as seen in the examples above).

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c2ccccc2)c(Cl)c1Cl** (0.64577123) and **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (0.85772694), but with slightly less chlorination than the latter, the property value should lie between these two. 

A reasonable estimate is **~0.75**. 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.75** (approximate, likely in the range 0.70–0.80). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the given data.)
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.39102141977369026
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isobutylene or 2-methylpropene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Branches**:
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane): Property = -0.79303999
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): Property = -1.63178302
   - **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (branched aldehyde): Property = -0.83804147
   - **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (steroid-like): Property = 1.16721652

   Branched alkanes tend to have more negative values than linear alkanes.

2. **Unsaturation (Double Bonds)**:
   - **CC=C(C)C** is an alkene (similar to **CCCCC(CC)C=O** but without the aldehyde group).
   - **COC(=O)C=C** (methyl acrylate): Property = 0.54324689 (but this has an ester group, which complicates comparison).
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): Property = -5.26721844 (very negative, likely due to long chain + double bond).

   Unsaturation (double bonds) in simpler hydrocarbons seems to reduce the property value further compared to saturated analogs.

3. **Small Branched Alkenes**:
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a small, branched alkene. The closest analog in the examples is **CCCCC(CC)C=O**, but this has an additional aldehyde group. The property for **CCCCC(CC)C=O** is -0.83804147.
   - Removing the aldehyde group (which likely contributes positively) would suggest a more negative value for **CC=C(C)C**.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Branched alkanes have more negative values than linear ones (e.g., **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** = -1.63 vs. **CCCCCCCC** = -0.79).
- Unsaturation (double bonds) further reduces the property value (e.g., **CCCCCCCCC=C** = -5.27, though this is a much larger molecule).
- **CC=C(C)C** is a small, branched alkene, so its value should be more negative than a similar-sized branched alkane but not as extreme as a long-chain alkene.

From the examples, the closest analog is **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (property = -1.63), but **CC=C(C)C** has a double bond, which would likely reduce the value further. However, it's a much smaller molecule, so the reduction won't be as drastic as in **CCCCCCCCC=C**.

### Estimated Property:
A reasonable estimate for **CC=C(C)C** would be between **-1.0 and -2.0**. Given the trends, I predict:

**Predicted property value for CC=C(C)C: -1.4** (approximately midway between the branched alkane and the long-chain alkene examples). 

This is a rough estimate based on the limited examples, but it aligns with the observed trends of branching and unsaturation reducing the property value.
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.7971136249026308
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the analysis:

1. **Simple halogenated alkanes**: 
   - `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) has a value of **0.05311701**.
   - `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` (a complex polychlorinated hydrocarbon) has a value of **0.82922277**.
   - `ClC4=C(Cl)C5(Cl)C3C1CC(C2OC12)C3C4(Cl)C5(Cl)Cl` (another polychlorinated structure) has a value of **0.67515697**.

2. **Dichloromethane (ClCCl)**: 
   - This is a much simpler molecule with only two chlorines and no additional complexity (no branching, unsaturation, or other functional groups).
   - Compared to the examples, it should have a lower magnitude than the more highly chlorinated or complex structures but may still be slightly positive due to the presence of halogens.

3. **Trend**: 
   - The property seems to increase with the number of chlorines and structural complexity.
   - Since `ClCCl` is simpler than the other chlorinated examples, its value should be closer to zero but still slightly positive.

**Predicted property for ClCCl (dichloromethane): ~0.02 to 0.05**.  
Given the closest simple example (`ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` at **0.053**), I would predict:  
**0.03 ± 0.01**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, polarizability, etc.—this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the data.)

Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -1.5330827899480353
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have lower (more negative) property values. For example:
     - `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **-1.53308279** (3 Cl atoms).
     - `Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1` has a value of **-3.66849922** (3 Br atoms, halogens behave similarly).
     - `OC1C=CC2C1C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` has a value of **0.4227045**, but this is an outlier due to its complex polycyclic structure.
   - The presence of multiple halogens (Cl, Br) generally reduces the property value.

2. **Phenol (OH attached to benzene)**:
   - Phenolic structures often have moderate to low property values unless other functional groups dominate. For example:
     - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(O)cc1` has a value of **-1.36714172**.
     - `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **-1.53308279**.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution**:
   - The molecule `Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl` is a trichlorophenol (2,4,6-trichlorophenol), which is highly symmetrical and heavily substituted with Cl atoms. This suggests a further reduction in the property value compared to less substituted phenols.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` (2,4,6-trichlorophenol) has a value of **-1.53308279**.
- `Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl` (2,3,6-trichlorophenol) is structurally very similar, with the same number of Cl atoms but slightly different substitution pattern. The property value should be close to the above.

### Prediction:
Given the strong influence of multiple Cl atoms and the phenolic OH group, the property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is expected to be slightly more negative than `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` due to the less symmetrical substitution (2,3,6 vs 2,4,6), which might slightly destabilize the molecule. 

**Predicted property value: -1.6** (approximate, likely between -1.5 and -1.7 based on the trend). 

However, since the exact value for `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` is -1.533, and the substitution pattern here is very similar, a reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: -1.55** (close to the known -1.53 for the 2,4,6-isomer). 

For consistency with the given examples, the predicted value is likely in the range of **-1.5 to -1.6**. 

### Final Answer:
**-1.55** (approximated based on the closest analogous example). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends. The property could be related to logP, solubility, or another molecular descriptor.)

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 2.1484275937375066
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to predict the property value. 

### Molecule to Predict:
**SMILES:** `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67`

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings and Substitutions**: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings (e.g., `c1cc...`) with methoxy (`OCH3`) and hydroxyl (`OH`) substitutions. From the examples:
   - `Cc1cc(C)c(O)c(C)c1` has a property value of `-1.34740246` (similar substitutions but simpler).
   - `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has `-0.30422982` (aromatic with polar groups).
   - The presence of multiple polar groups (OCH3, OH) may lower the property value.

2. **Oxygen-Rich Functional Groups**: The molecule has many ethers (`O`), esters (`COC=O`), and hydroxyl groups (`OH`). Examples with similar features:
   - `OCC(O)CO` has `0.6406138` (simpler polyol).
   - `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` has `0.19438064` (complex sugar-like structure).
   - Oxygen-rich structures tend to have moderate to low positive values.

3. **Complexity and Size**: The molecule is large and highly branched with multiple rings and functional groups. Larger molecules in the examples:
   - `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` (long alkane) has `1.88896976`.
   - `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5cccc6c(c1)c2c3c4c56` (polycyclic aromatic) has `1.32554383`.
   - However, the presence of many polar groups likely reduces the property value compared to purely hydrophobic large molecules.

4. **Specific Functional Groups**:
   - The ester (`COC=O`) is present in `CCOC(=O)N(C)C(=O)CSP(=S)(OCC)OCC` (property `0.77090339`).
   - The dioxolane (`OCOc5cc67`) is similar to `OCO` in some examples but not directly comparable.

### Comparison to Closest Examples:
The molecule most resembles complex, oxygen-rich structures like:
- `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (property `0.19438064`), but with more aromaticity and substitutions.
- `O=c2c(C3CCCc4ccccc43)c(O)c1ccccc1o2` (property `0.98537583`), which has aromatic + ester features.

Given the balance of aromaticity, polar groups, and size, the property value is likely in the moderate positive range but lower than purely hydrophobic large molecules.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.45** (estimated based on structural similarity to examples with values between `0.194` and `0.985`). 

This accounts for:
- The dampening effect of polar groups (OH, OCH3).
- The contribution of aromatic rings and size.
- The presence of ester and ether linkages. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the examples.)

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.9423928307883442
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** with a **thiomethyl (CS)** group, a **hydrazine (NH)** group, and a **tert-butyl (C(C)(C)C)** substituent. The ring also has a **carbonyl (=O)** group, which is polar and can influence the property.
2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Thiomethyl (CS)**: Moderately polar but less polar than oxygen-containing groups.
   - **Carbonyl (=O)**: Highly polar and electronegative.
   - **Tert-butyl (C(C)(C)C)**: Bulky and hydrophobic.
   - **Hydrazine (NH)**: Polar and capable of hydrogen bonding.
3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Similar to **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property = -0.05505048), which has a polar ring with a carbonyl, a sulfur atom, and a tert-butyl group. The property is slightly negative due to the balance of polar and nonpolar groups.
   - The presence of the **thiomethyl (CS)** group may slightly decrease the property compared to oxygenated analogs (e.g., **CO** has a high positive value, but sulfur is less polar).
   - The **tert-butyl group** adds hydrophobicity, pulling the property toward zero or slightly negative.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of polar (C=O, NH) and nonpolar (tert-butyl, CS) groups, the property is likely **slightly negative**, similar to the example above but potentially a bit more negative due to the additional sulfur. 

**Predicted value: -0.15** (a reasonable estimate based on structural analogs). 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data. The value is likely in the range of **-0.1 to -0.3**. If more context were provided (e.g., the property is logP), the prediction could be refined further. 

**Final answer: -0.15** (approximate).

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -1.3645695996974423
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) tend to have negative property values unless they are heavily substituted with electron-withdrawing or bulky groups.
   - Example: `c1ccc2cnccc2c1` has a value of **-1.23124883**, while `Nc1ccccc1` (aniline) has **0.02265308** due to the electron-donating NH2 group.

2. **Esters (RCOOR')**:
   - Esters generally have moderately negative or near-zero values unless combined with other functional groups.
   - Example: `CCCC(=O)OC` has **-0.44427584**, and `CCCCC(=O)OCC` has the same value (**-0.44427584**), suggesting ester groups contribute similarly.

3. **Phenyl Esters**:
   - The molecule `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` is an ethyl ester of benzoic acid (ethyl benzoate). 
   - Compare to `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (diphenyl ether), which has **-1.77297838**, but this lacks the ester carbonyl. The ester group in `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` may reduce the negativity slightly due to the polar carbonyl.

4. **Similar Structures**:
   - `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2` has **1.28431389**, but this is a much more complex molecule with additional polar groups (sulfonyl, nitroso, etc.), so it's not directly comparable.
   - Simpler esters like `CCCC(=O)OC` (**-0.44427584**) are closer analogs.

### Prediction:
Given the above, **ethyl benzoate (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1)** is expected to have a property value similar to other simple esters but slightly less negative than diphenyl ether due to the ester's carbonyl polarization. A reasonable estimate is between **-0.4 and -0.6**.

From the examples, the closest match is `CCCC(=O)OC` (**-0.44427584**). Since ethyl benzoate has a phenyl ring instead of an alkyl chain, the aromaticity may slightly lower the value (more negative), but the ester group's effect is dominant. 

### Final Prediction:
**-0.50** (approximate interpolation between simpler esters and aromatic systems). 

However, looking at the exact examples, the value for `CCCC(=O)OC` is **-0.44427584**, and `CCCCC(=O)OCC` is the same. Since ethyl benzoate is structurally similar (just replacing the alkyl with phenyl), the value is likely close to these. The phenyl ring might make it slightly more negative, but not drastically. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is:  
**-0.45** (rounded from the ester trend). 

But to match the precision of the given examples, I'd suggest:  
**-0.44427584** (same as `CCCC(=O)OC` and `CCCCC(=O)OCC`, as the phenyl ring's effect seems balanced by the ester's contribution in this context). 

However, if we consider that phenyl esters might be slightly more negative, another close example is `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (**-1.77297838**), but this is less relevant due to the lack of a carbonyl. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest bet is to use the simple ester value:  
**Predicted value: -0.44427584** (same as `CCCC(=O)OC`). 

But since the phenyl ring could modestly lower it, an adjusted estimate is **-0.5**. 

Given the data, I'll stick with:  
**-0.44427584** (matching the ester trend precisely). 

### Final Answer:

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -1.3980793073315951
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkyl Halides (e.g., CI, Cl-containing molecules):**
   - **CI** has a property value of **0.65137868** (relatively high for a small molecule).
   - Other Cl-containing molecules vary widely, but the presence of halogens often increases the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

2. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, aromatics):**
   - **CCCC (=O)CCC** (heptan-4-one): **-0.3101186**
   - **CCCCCCCO** (octanol): **-0.41154186**
   - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-octene): **-0.78011019**
   - Pure hydrocarbons (no halogens or polar groups) tend to have lower (more negative) property values.

3. **Brominated Compounds:**
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene): **-2.22700695** (this is an aromatic system, so not directly comparable).
   - No simple alkyl bromides are in the examples, but we can infer from **CI** that Br (a heavier halogen) might have a similar or slightly lower effect than Cl in an alkyl chain.

4. **Chain Length and Functional Groups:**
   - Longer alkyl chains with polar groups (e.g., **CCCCCCCO**) have moderately negative values.
   - The presence of Br in an alkyl chain likely increases the property value compared to the pure hydrocarbon but not as much as Cl in small molecules.

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCBr**:
- This is a linear alkyl bromide (1-bromoheptane), analogous to heptane but with a Br substituent.
- Compared to **CCCCCCCO** (octanol, **-0.41154186**), replacing the OH with Br would likely increase the property value (Br is less polar than OH but adds significant molecular weight and polarizability).
- Compared to **CI** (**0.65137868**), a longer alkyl chain with Br would likely reduce the property value (due to dilution of the halogen's effect over a larger molecule).
- The closest analog is **CCCCCCCO**, and Br is somewhat between H and OH in its effect.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is likely slightly negative but higher than pure hydrocarbons. A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.25 to -0.10**.  

A precise prediction based on the trends:  
**-0.18**.  

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is **-0.18**.
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.103138554570512
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property value for **CO (methanol)**:

1. **Simple Alcohols**: 
   - **CCC(C)CO** (2-methyl-1-butanol) has a property value of **0.30829903**.
   - **OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O** (a sugar-like polyol) has a property value of **-0.42849623**, likely due to high polarity and hydrogen bonding.
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (4-heptanol) has a property value of **-0.40927309**, suggesting longer aliphatic chains with a single -OH group reduce the property value.

2. **Methanol (CO)**:
   - Methanol is a very small, polar molecule with a single -OH group.
   - Compared to **CCC(C)CO**, methanol is simpler and more polar, which might lower its property value slightly.
   - However, it lacks the aliphatic bulk of larger alcohols, so its value may not be as negative as polyols or long-chain alcohols.

3. **Estimate**:
   - The simplest alcohol in the examples is **CCC(C)CO** (0.308), but methanol is even simpler and more polar.
   - Small polar molecules like **NC(=O)N** (urea, 0.906) and **NC(N)=NC#N** (0.581) have higher values, but methanol is less complex.
   - Given the trend, methanol likely has a property value between **0.2 and 0.4**.

**Predicted property value for CO (methanol): ~0.25**  
*(This is an educated guess based on the examples, assuming the property correlates with molecular size, polarity, and functional group contributions.)*  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is a rough estimate. If you clarify the property, the prediction could be refined.)*
