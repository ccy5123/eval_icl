SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 1.0423948101001925
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can identify some patterns in the property values:

1. Simple alkanes and alcohols with longer carbon chains (e.g., CCCCC(C)O, CCCCCC, CCCCCCC(C)O) tend to have high property values around 1.21408337.

2. Molecules with ester groups (C(=O)OC) tend to have slightly lower values than pure alkanes/alcohols but still positive:
   - CCOC(=O)CC: 0.83636854
   - CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC: 1.06880843

3. The molecule in question, CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, is very similar to CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (which has a value of 1.06880843), just one carbon shorter in the chain.

Given that:
- The property decreases slightly with shorter chain length in esters
- The difference between CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (10C) and CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (9C) should be small

I would predict the property value for CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC to be slightly lower than 1.06880843, approximately:

**Predicted property value: 1.05** (rounded from likely ~1.05-1.06 range)

This maintains the observed trend where longer ester chains have higher values approaching the alkane/alcohol values, with each -CH2- removal slightly decreasing the value.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic heterocycle with a lactam (amide)**: The structure contains a fused aromatic system with a lactam (cyclic amide, `oc(=O)[nH]`). This is similar to molecules like:
   - `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)` (property: -0.04496605), which also has a cyclic amide/thioamide.
   - `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1` (property: -0.67449076), which has two cyclic amides.

2. **Chlorine substitution**: The presence of a chlorine atom (`Cl`) on the aromatic ring is common in many of the examples, often associated with negative property values (e.g., `ClC=C`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl`, etc.).

3. **Fused aromatic system**: The molecule is a benzofuran derivative with an additional lactam, which introduces polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding (via the `[nH]` group).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analogs are cyclic amides/heterocycles with aromatic substitution. These tend to have property values in the range of **-0.67 to -0.04**.
- The presence of the lactam (`oc(=O)[nH]`) suggests a moderately negative value, similar to `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)` (-0.04496605) but more negative due to the chlorine.
- The chlorine's electronegativity and the aromatic system's polarizability likely push the value toward the more negative end of the range.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to cyclic amides with aromatic substitution and chlorine, the predicted property value is:  
**-0.67449076** (same as other cyclic amides with aromatic/chlorine features in the dataset).

### Note:
This prediction assumes the property is related to a metric like **logP (lipophilicity)** or a similar physicochemical parameter, where:
- Chlorine and aromatic systems decrease the value (more negative).
- Cyclic amides contribute to polarity, further decreasing the value.  
The repeated occurrence of **-0.67449076** for similar structures supports this assignment.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O):**
   - The molecule **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** has a nitro group attached to a heterocyclic ring and a property value of **0.2697963**.
   - Nitro groups generally appear to contribute to moderately positive property values when not heavily counterbalanced by other features (e.g., aromaticity or halogens).

2. **Aliphatic Nitro Compounds:**
   - The molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is an aliphatic nitro compound (specifically, **2-nitropropane**). Aliphatic nitro compounds are not heavily represented in the examples, but the presence of the nitro group is likely the dominant feature.

3. **Comparison with Other Functional Groups:**
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCOCC**, **CCCCCl**) tend to have high property values (~1.214).
   - Aromatic systems with halogens or heteroatoms (e.g., **Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1**, **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**) tend to have low property values (~-0.674).
   - The nitro group in **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** suggests that nitro groups can pull the property value toward the middle range (here, 0.2697963).

4. **Steric and Electronic Effects:**
   - The nitro group is highly electron-withdrawing, which may reduce the property value compared to pure aliphatic chains. However, in **CC(C)N(=O)=O**, the aliphatic part (isopropyl) is not heavily polar or aromatic, so the nitro group's effect is somewhat balanced.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Pure aliphatic chains have high values (~1.214).
- Nitro groups in mixed contexts (e.g., **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO**) give ~0.269.
- **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is an aliphatic nitro compound with no other strongly modulating features, the property value is likely **between 0.269 and 1.214**, but closer to the lower end due to the nitro group's electron-withdrawing nature.

A reasonable estimate is **~0.5**, but looking at the examples, the closest match is **0.2697963** (for **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO**). Since **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is simpler and lacks additional polar groups, the value might be slightly higher.

However, another example with a nitro-like group is **NC(=O)NC1NC(=O)NC1=O** (property = **-0.20234723**), but this is more complex. 

Given the lack of exact matches, the most plausible prediction is:  
**0.2697963** (same as **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO**).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is **0.2697963**.

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 0.8543549620036873
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, and molecular complexity. The molecule in question is a steroid derivative with multiple rings, hydroxyl (-OH), and carbonyl (C=O) groups. 

Breaking it down:
1. The presence of **hydroxyl (-OH)** and **carbonyl (C=O)** groups suggests some polarity, but the extensive hydrophobic ring system counterbalances this.
2. The molecule is structurally similar to **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (property = **0.85435496**), which also has a steroid-like framework and carbonyl groups.
3. The additional **-OH** and **-CH2OH** groups in the new molecule may slightly increase polarity compared to the reference, but the overall hydrophobic core dominates.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for **CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO** would be close to the reference steroid-like molecule but adjusted slightly higher due to the extra polar groups. 

**Predicted property value: ~0.89**  
*(Likely in the range of 0.85–0.92, similar to other carbonyl-containing polycyclic structures in the examples.)*  

*(Note: Without explicit training on a specific property [e.g., logP, solubility, etc.], this is an empirical estimate based on structural analogs in the provided data.)*

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **High values (~1.214)**:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., CCCCCCCCBr, CCCCCCC(C)O).
   - Small, non-aromatic, or non-polar molecules (e.g., CNN, ClCCCl).
   - Molecules with single functional groups (e.g., alcohols like CCC(O)CC).

2. **Intermediate values (~0.1 to ~0.9)**:
   - Molecules with moderate complexity or polarity (e.g., CCCCCC=O at 0.899, CCCCCc1ccccc1 at 0.184).
   - Some cyclic or partially aromatic structures (e.g., CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(=O)C2 at 1.025).

3. **Low values (~-0.2 to ~-0.7)**:
   - Aromatic systems with electronegative substituents (e.g., Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1 at -0.674, CN(C)c1ccccc1 at -0.202).
   - Polyhalogenated aromatics (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 at -0.674).
   - Heteroaromatics (e.g., c1cncnc1 at -0.674).
   - Molecules with multiple polar/aromatic groups (e.g., NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1 at -0.674).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2** has:
- Two aromatic rings (one fluorinated, one chlorinated).
- Polar amide linkages (C(=O)NC(=O)N).
- Multiple electronegative substituents (F, Cl, C=O).

This structure resembles examples like:
- **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (-0.674): Aromatic + polar amide-like group.
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (-0.674): Polyhalogenated aromatic.
- **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (-0.674): Aromatic with polar linker.

The presence of multiple aromatic rings, halogens, and polar amide groups strongly suggests a **low property value**, likely in the **-0.6 to -0.7 range**.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.67449076**  
*(This matches the recurring value for similar aromatic/polar/halogenated structures in the examples.)*

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I notice that the property value tends to cluster around certain values for specific structural features. Here are some key observations:

1. Simple aliphatic chains (especially those with oxygen functionality like -OH or -O-) often have a property value of **1.21408337**. Examples include:
   - CCCC(C)(O)CC
   - CCCCCO
   - CCCC(C)CO
   - OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO
   - CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC

2. The molecule **CCCOC(C)C** is an aliphatic ether with a structure similar to many of the examples above (e.g., CCCCCO, CCCC(C)CO). It has no strongly polar or aromatic groups that would significantly alter the property value from the typical aliphatic trend.

3. The presence of an ether linkage (-O-) in aliphatic chains does not seem to deviate from the 1.21408337 value, as seen in CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC (which is also an ether derivative).

Given this pattern, the most likely property value for **CCCOC(C)C** is:

**Predicted property value: 1.21408337**

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.3747170885981085
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, we can deduce the property value by comparing structural features and trends from the provided data.

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds (Cl/Br):**  
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine substitutions (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls like `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl`) consistently have a property value of **-0.67449076**.  
   - Bromine substitutions (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1`) yield values around **-0.43841899**.

2. **Heterocycles with Polar Groups:**  
   - Molecules like `Nc1nccs1` (thiazole) or `c1ccoc1` (furan) also show **-0.67449076**, suggesting that small heterocycles with electronegative atoms trend toward this value.  
   - Larger or more substituted heterocycles (e.g., `CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1`) deviate slightly (e.g., **0.40469446**).

3. **Carbonyls and Amides:**  
   - Compounds with amides (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC`) tend toward **0.50586807**, but if combined with halogens (e.g., Br), the value drops (e.g., **-0.43841899**).

4. **Aliphatic Chains:**  
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., `CCC(C)CC`) or thioethers (e.g., `CCSCC`) consistently show **1.21408337**.

### Target Molecule Analysis:  
**CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**  
- **Structure:** A brominated uracil derivative with:  
  - A carbonyl group (C=O).  
  - An amide-like [nH] group.  
  - A bromine substituent (electron-withdrawing).  
  - An aliphatic side chain (`CCC(C)`).  

### Comparison:  
- The bromine suggests a value close to **-0.43841899** (as in `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1`).  
- The heterocycle (uracil) with polar groups may push it toward **-0.40469446** (like `COc2cnc1cncnc1n2`).  
- The aliphatic side chain could slightly increase the value, but the bromine and carbonyl dominate.  

### Predicted Property Value:  
**-0.43841899**  
*(This aligns best with brominated aromatic/heterocyclic examples, accounting for the polar and electron-withdrawing effects.)*

Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), we can observe the following patterns:

1. **Aromatic Systems**: Molecules with extended aromatic systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or conjugated rings) tend to have negative property values. For example:
   - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (coronene): -0.67449076  
   - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a polycyclic aromatic amine): -0.67449076  
   - **c2(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1nccnc1c2(Cl)** (a chlorinated heteroaromatic): -0.67449076  

2. **Biphenyl-like Structures**: The given molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** is a simple biphenyl (two benzene rings linked directly). Similar structures in the examples (e.g., **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C**, a methyl-substituted biphenyl-like structure) have a property value of **-0.35972841**.  

3. **Trend**: The property value becomes more negative as the aromatic system becomes larger or more conjugated. Biphenyl is less conjugated/extended than the polycyclic examples (which have values around -0.67), so its value should be less negative than those but still negative.  

Given this, the predicted property value for **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** is likely similar to **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C**, i.e., **-0.35972841**.  

### Final Answer:  
**-0.35972841**
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCS** (butane-1-thiol), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, cycloalkanes, etc.) with no polar or electronegative atoms**:
   - Examples: `C1CCC2CCCCC2C1`, `CC(C)I`, `CCCCCC(C)C`, `CCC1CCCCC1`, `CCCC(C)(C)C`, `OC1CCCCCCC1`, `CC1CO1`, `CC45CCC2C(CCC3CC1SC1CC23C)C4CCC5O`, `CCCCCCCC(C)O`.
   - These consistently have a property value of **1.21408337**.
   - These molecules are non-polar, saturated, and lack functional groups that introduce significant polarity or electronic effects.

2. **Molecules with sulfur (S) in non-polar or weakly polar environments**:
   - Example: `CCCCCCCC(C)O` (with an -OH group but still 1.21408337) suggests that sulfur alone (as in thiols) may not drastically change the property if the rest of the molecule is non-polar.
   - However, sulfur in more polar or conjugated systems (e.g., `Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1`) leads to negative or lower values.

3. **Polar functional groups (e.g., -NO2, -Cl, -OH, -C=O, -N, etc.)**:
   - These typically reduce the property value, often to negative numbers (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` = -0.67449076).
   - Thiols (-SH) are weakly polar but less disruptive than halogens or nitro groups.

4. **Molecules with sulfur in non-conjugated, aliphatic environments**:
   - Example: `CCc1cccc(C)c1N(C(C)COC)C(=O)CCl` has a value of 0.33274877, but this also includes other polar groups.
   - `CCCCS` is simpler, with just a thiol group attached to butane.

### Prediction for `CCCCS`:
- The molecule is primarily aliphatic (non-polar) with a single weakly polar thiol (-SH) group.
- The thiol group is less polar than halogens or nitro groups, so it won't reduce the property as drastically.
- The closest analogs are the alkanes (property = 1.21408337), but the -SH group will likely reduce this slightly.
- No examples of simple aliphatic thiols are given, but based on the trend, I estimate a modest reduction from the alkane value.

### Estimated Property:
Given the lack of strong polar or electronic effects, I predict the property for `CCCCS` to be slightly lower than the alkane value but still positive. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.8** (approximate, likely between 0.7 and 1.0 based on trends). 

However, since the examples show alkanes rigidly at 1.21408337 and even `CCCCCCCC=C` (with a double bond) is at 0.79440023, I'll refine this to:

**Final predicted value: 0.79440023** (similar to `CCCCCCCC=C`, as the thiol is weakly polar like a double bond). 

But if we assume the property is more sensitive to sulfur, it might be closer to `CCCCCC(C)O` (1.21408337), so perhaps higher. Given the uncertainty, I'll settle on:

**Predicted property value: 0.83636854** (same as `CCNC(=S)NCC`, which also has a thioamide group, though this is a stretch). 

Given the ambiguity, the safest answer is likely **0.58455866** (as seen in `CCCC(=C)C` and `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O`, which have some similarity in branching or sulfur).

After reconsidering, the most consistent estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.58455866**. 

This aligns with weakly polar/aliphatic sulfur-containing molecules in the dataset.

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Highly positive values (~1.214)** are associated with:
   - Simple alkanes with halogen substituents (e.g., **ClC(Cl)Cl**, **BrC(Br)Br**, **CCBr**).
   - Branched alkanes with hydroxyl groups (e.g., **CCCC(C)(O)CC**, **CCC(C)(C)C**, **CC(C)CC(C)O**).
   - Ethers with short chains (e.g., **CCCCOC**).

2. **Intermediate positive values (~0.5–1.0)** are seen in:
   - Esters (e.g., **CCCC(=O)OCC**).
   - Carbonyl-containing aliphatic chains (e.g., **CC(=O)OCC(COC(=O)C)OC(=O)C**).

3. **Negative values** are associated with:
   - Aromatic rings, especially with halogens or nitro groups (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1**, **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1**).
   - Heterocycles (e.g., **NC(=O)c1cnccn1**).

### Analysis of **CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
- The structure is a **branched alkane with a terminal hydroxyl group**, similar to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (property = 1.214) and **CC(C)CC(C)O** (property = 1.214).
- The presence of **C(C)(C)CO** (tertiary carbon with OH) is structurally analogous to other branched alcohols with high positive values.
- No aromaticity or electronegative substituents (e.g., halogens, nitro groups) are present to lower the value.

### Prediction:
Given the strong similarity to molecules with **property = 1.21408337**, the predicted value for **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is:

**1.21408337**

Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.5028022025189165
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular structure.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple benzene (**c1ccccc1**) has a property value of **-0.67449076**.
   - Substituted benzenes with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1**) retain the same value (**-0.67449076**), while alkyl-substituted benzenes (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1**) have less negative values (e.g., **-0.20234723** for **CCc1ccccc1**).

2. **Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs)**:
   - Naphthalene-like structures (e.g., **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**) are present in the examples:
     - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (a methyl-substituted anthracene/phenanthrene) has a value of **-0.54858582**.
     - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (a methyl-substituted naphthalene) has a value of **-0.35972841**.
   - The property becomes less negative as the aromatic system grows or is alkyl-substituted.

3. **Alkyl Substitution**:
   - Adding methyl groups (**-CH3**) tends to increase the property value (make it less negative). For example:
     - **c1ccccc1**: -0.67449076 → **Cc1ccccc1**: -0.20234723.
     - **Cc1cccc(C)c1C**: -0.04496605 (two methyl groups on benzene).

### Analysis of **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**:
- This is a **methyl-substituted naphthalene** (methyl group on one benzene ring of naphthalene).
- Comparing to similar structures:
  - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (methyl-substituted naphthalene): **-0.35972841**.
  - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (methyl-substituted anthracene/phenanthrene): **-0.54858582**.
- The molecule is simpler than the anthracene/phenanthrene case but more complex than a single substituted benzene. The methyl group will increase the value compared to pure naphthalene (which would likely be around **-0.67449076**, like benzene).

### Predicted Property:
Given the examples, the value for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** should be close to **-0.35972841** (like **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12**), as it is a methyl-substituted naphthalene. 

However, since the methyl group is on a single position (not two like in **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12**), the value might be slightly more negative. A reasonable estimate is between **-0.4** and **-0.5**. 

Given the data, the closest match is **-0.35972841**, but since this molecule has one fewer methyl group than **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12**, we might adjust slightly downward. 

But in the absence of a direct example, the safest prediction is to use the most similar example: **-0.35972841**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is **-0.35972841**.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 0.42717748100184366
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic urea derivative with two carbonyl groups and two nitrogens. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **0.03372454**.
   - The core is identical, but the substituents differ.

2. **Substituents**: 
   - The given molecule has **C(C)CCC** and **CC=C** substituents on the hydantoin ring, which are **alkyl chains** (branched and unsaturated). 
   - The example molecule has **C** (methyl) and **CC=C** (allyl) substituents, yielding a slightly positive property value (0.03372454). 
   - The additional **C(C)CCC** (branched alkyl) substituent in the given molecule is more hydrophobic/lipophilic than the methyl group in the example, which would likely **increase the property value slightly** (since longer/branched alkyl chains correlate with higher values in the examples, e.g., **CC(C)C** = 1.21408337).

3. **Comparison to Other Examples**:
   - Molecules with **large hydrophobic groups** (e.g., **CCCCCCCCCCCCCC** = 1.21408337) have high property values.
   - Molecules with **polar/aromatic groups** (e.g., **c1ccccc1NC(=O)c2c(O)cccc2** = -0.67449076) have low property values.
   - The given molecule is **intermediate**: it has a polar hydantoin core but significant hydrophobic substituents.

### Prediction:
The property value for **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C** is likely **slightly higher** than the similar example **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (0.03372454) due to the additional hydrophobic **C(C)CCC** group. However, it won't reach the very high values of pure alkanes because of the polar core.

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.15** (between 0.03372454 and higher alkyl-dominated values).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend that hydrophobic groups increase the value and polar/aromatic groups decrease it.)  

---  
**Final answer: 0.15** (approximate interpolation from similar examples).  

(If the property is something like logP or solubility, this aligns with the trend.)

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.40469445568595713
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), we can attempt to predict its property value based on structural trends observed in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple Hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCCC, C1CCCC1, CSSC, CCO)** tend to have high property values (often **1.21408337**), suggesting that aliphatic or non-polar structures correlate with this high value.
2. **Aromatic Rings with Polar/Electron-Withdrawing Substituents** (e.g., Cl, Br, I, CF3, NO2, COOR) tend to have negative or lower property values. Examples:
   - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**: -0.67449076  
   - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**: -0.67449076  
   - **COc1ccccc1O**: -0.40469446 (polar substituents lower the value).  
   - **CC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC**: 0.45865372 (less negative due to ester groups).  
3. **Trifluoromethyl (CF3) Groups**:  
   The CF3 group is strongly electron-withdrawing and would likely behave similarly to halogens (Cl, Br) or other deactivating groups, pushing the property value toward the negative range.  

### Prediction for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1:
- The molecule is an aromatic ring with a **CF3 group**, which is highly electronegative and polar.  
- Comparable structures (e.g., **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**, **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**) have values around **-0.67449076**.  
- The CF3 group is even more electron-withdrawing than Cl or Br, but the absence of additional halogens or polar groups might place it slightly higher than -0.67449076.  
- However, **COc1ccccc1O** (less electron-withdrawing than CF3) has **-0.40469446**, suggesting CF3 could be more negative.  

Given these trends, a reasonable estimate for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is:  
**-0.67449076** (similar to heavily halogenated aromatics).  

### Final Answer:
**-0.67449076**

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can observe that the property value tends to be higher (more positive) for molecules with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and aliphatic chains, while it is lower (more negative) for aromatic systems, especially those with heteroatoms or halogens.

The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar derivative (specifically, a hexose like glucose or galactose) with multiple hydroxyl groups. 

Looking at similar molecules in the examples:
- **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (a linear sugar alcohol like sorbitol) has a property value of **1.21408337**.
- **CCC(C)(O)CC** and **CC(C)C(C)O** (both with multiple -OH groups and aliphatic chains) also have property values of **1.21408337**.

Given that the molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is structurally similar to these (multiple -OH groups and aliphatic character), I predict its property value to be:

**1.21408337**

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 0.6392999372430337
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule, I observe the following patterns:

1. Highly halogenated compounds (especially Cl/Br) tend to have high positive values (e.g., 1.21408337 for ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)...)
2. Aromatic systems with electronegative substituents (O, N, Cl) tend to have negative values (e.g., -0.67449076 for Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl)
3. Steroids and complex polycyclic structures with carbonyl groups tend to have values between 0.4-0.9 (e.g., 0.93079725 for CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C)
4. Simple aliphatic chains with polar groups often have values around 0.5-1.0

The target molecule is a complex steroid-like structure with:
- Multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)
- Hydroxyl groups (OH)
- A conjugated system (C=CC=C)
- Polycyclic framework

Comparing with similar structures in the examples:
- CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C has 0.87070625
- CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C has 0.93079725

The target molecule has additional polar groups (2 more C=O and 1 OH) which would likely increase the value slightly, but also has a conjugated system which might decrease it slightly.

Considering these factors, the predicted value would be between 0.87-0.93. Taking the average and adjusting slightly for the additional polar groups, I predict:

**0.896 ± 0.02**

The most precise prediction would be: **0.89625183**

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 1.1146847288192152
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**, I can make the following observations to predict the property:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Steroids/Terpenoids with Hydroxyl/Carbonyl Groups**: 
   - Molecules like **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O** (property = 0.58455866) and **CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O** (property = 0.58455866) have similar structural motifs (multiple rings with oxygen-containing functional groups) and show property values around **0.58**.
   - These structures often have a balance of hydrophobic (alkyl/ring) and polar (OH/C=O) groups, leading to intermediate property values.

2. **Highly Hydrophobic/Aliphatic Chains**:
   - Molecules like **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (property = 1.02522595) and **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (property = 1.21408337) have long alkyl chains or bulky hydrophobic groups with a single polar group, leading to higher property values (> 1.0).

3. **Aromatic Systems with Halogens/Polar Groups**:
   - Molecules like **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (property = -0.67449076) or **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (property = -0.67449076) have aromatic rings with halogens or polar groups, leading to low property values (around -0.67).

### Target Molecule Analysis:
The target molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O** is a **steroid/terpenoid-like structure** with:
- Multiple fused rings (hydrophobic core).
- A **carbonyl group (C=O)** and a **hydroxyl group (OH)**.
- No aromaticity or halogens.

This is very similar to the examples like **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O** (property = 0.58455866), which also has fused rings with OH groups. The presence of both C=O and OH suggests a similar balance of polarity and hydrophobicity.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to molecules with property values around **0.58**, the predicted property for **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O** is:

**0.58455866** (same as the closely matched examples). 

This value reflects the intermediate polarity/hydrophobicity of such steroid-like frameworks with oxygen-containing functional groups.

Iteration: 17
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.4384189936597869
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on structural features.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (NO2)**: 
   - Molecules with nitro groups (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1`, `O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12`, `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1`) tend to have property values around **-0.67449076**.
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which likely contributes to lower (more negative) property values.

2. **Amide Groups (CONR)**:
   - Molecules with amide groups (e.g., `CC(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1`) have property values around **1.04239481** (positive).
   - However, when combined with other polar or electron-withdrawing groups, the property value may decrease.

3. **Combination of Amide and Nitro**:
   - The molecule `CC(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` has a positive value (**1.04239481**), but when combined with a nitro group, the value is likely to decrease significantly.
   - For example, `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` has a value of **-0.35972841**, showing that the nitro group reduces the property value.

4. **Aromatic Systems with Nitro and Amide**:
   - The molecule `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has:
     - An amide group (`CC(=O)N-`).
     - A nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) attached to the aromatic ring.
     - This is similar to `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` (value = **-0.35972841**), but with a simpler aromatic system.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of both an amide and a nitro group on an aromatic ring, the property value is expected to be negative, similar to other nitro-containing aromatic compounds but slightly less negative than pure nitroaromatics (which are around **-0.67449076**). 

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.35972841** (amide + nitro) and **-0.40469446** (seen in other polar/nitro-aromatic systems).

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is **-0.35972841**.

Iteration: 18
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 0.11241512657943255
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12`, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (`P(=S)(OCC)`)**:
   - The presence of a phosphorus atom with sulfur (`P=S`) and ethoxy (`OCC`) groups is somewhat unique in the examples, but similar to ester-like or sulfur-containing functionalities.
   - Sulfur-containing groups (e.g., `CSSC`) tend to have higher positive values (e.g., `CSSC` = 1.214), but this is not always the case (e.g., `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2` = -0.404).

2. **Aromatic system with Cl substitution (`n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12`)**:
   - This is a fused aromatic system with a lactam (`c(=O)o`) and a chlorine substituent (`Cl`).
   - Chlorinated aromatics in the examples (e.g., `Clc1cccc2ccccc12`, `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1`) consistently have a value of **-0.67449076**.
   - The lactam (`c(=O)o`) might slightly modulate this, but the dominant influence is likely the chlorine.

3. **Ethoxy groups (`OCC`)**:
   - Ethoxy or alkoxy groups (e.g., `COC(=O)Nc2nc1ccc(cc1[nH]2)C(=O)c3ccccc3` = -0.556) often contribute to negative or neutral values, but this depends on context.

4. **Sulfur linkage (`SC`)**:
   - Sulfur linkages (e.g., `CSSC` = 1.214) can push the value higher, but in this case, the aromatic chlorine likely dominates.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analogs are chlorinated aromatics, which all have **-0.67449076**.
- The phosphorothioate and sulfur linkage might offset this slightly, but not enough to push the value into positive territory.
- No example with both Cl and P/S has a positive value, so the chlorine's influence is likely stronger.

### Predicted Value:
Given the dominance of the chlorinated aromatic system, the most reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.67449076** (same as other chlorinated aromatics in the dataset).

### Note:
If the phosphorothioate group were expected to have a stronger influence (e.g., like `CSSC`), the value might be higher, but the examples suggest that chlorinated aromatics consistently override other features. Thus, **-0.67449076** is the safest prediction.

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe the following patterns:

1. The value **1.21408337** appears frequently for simple aliphatic compounds, especially those with:
   - Halogen substituents (Cl, Br, I)
   - Simple alcohols (e.g., CCOH, CCC(C)O)
   - No aromatic rings or complex functional groups

2. The molecule **CC(C)(C)CO** is a tertiary alcohol (2-methyl-2-propanol) with a simple aliphatic structure, similar to other molecules like:
   - CC(C)CO (1.21408337)
   - CCC (1.21408337)
   - CCCC(C)O (1.21408337)

3. There are no complicating features (e.g., aromaticity, multiple functional groups, or conjugated systems) that would lower the value from the common **1.21408337** seen in similar cases.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CC(C)(C)CO** is:

**1.21408337**

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12`, let's break down the patterns:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Negative Values (~ -0.674)**:
   - Often associated with aromatic heterocycles containing nitrogen (e.g., `Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2`, `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F`, `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1`).
   - Presence of polar groups (e.g., carbonyls, nitro groups) or halogens in aromatic systems.
   - The value `-0.67449076` appears frequently for such structures.

2. **Moderate Negative Values (~ -0.4 to -0.5)**:
   - Seen in simpler aromatic systems with halogens or sulfur (e.g., `c1ccccc1SC`, `Cc1ccccc1N`, `Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl`).

3. **Positive Values (~ 1.214)**:
   - Associated with aliphatic, non-polar, or halogenated aliphatic structures (e.g., `CCC1CCCCC1`, `CC(C)CCO`, `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br`).

### Target Molecule: `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12`
- This is a **purine-like bicyclic aromatic heterocycle** with multiple nitrogens and a carbonyl group (lactam).
- Structurally similar to molecules like `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` and `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1`, which have the property value `-0.67449076`.
- The presence of multiple nitrogens and a carbonyl in an aromatic system strongly suggests a highly negative value.

### Predicted Property Value:
The most likely value is **`-0.67449076`**, matching the trend for similar nitrogen-rich aromatic heterocycles with polar functional groups.
==================================================
Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.7419398354242547
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain recurring numbers, particularly **1.21408337**, **-0.67449076**, and intermediate values like **0.50586807**, **-0.43841899**, etc. 

Key observations:
1. **Simple aliphatic chains with polar groups (e.g., alcohols, ethers, halides)** often have the value **1.21408337**. Examples:
   - `CCCCCC(C)O` (hexanol derivative) → 1.21408337  
   - `CC(C)O` (isopropanol) → 1.21408337  
   - `ClCCCCl` (dichloropropane) → 1.21408337  
   - `CCCCCCCO` (octanol derivative) → 1.21408337  

2. **Aromatic systems (especially halogenated or heterocyclic)** often have the value **-0.67449076**. Examples:
   - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` (chlorinated biphenyl) → -0.67449076  
   - `Oc1ccncc1` (hydroxypyridine) → -0.67449076  
   - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (nicotinamide) → -0.67449076  

3. **Molecules with mixed features (e.g., aliphatic + aromatic, complex polar groups)** have intermediate values. Examples:
   - `CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NC(C)C)n1` (chlorinated heterocycle with alkylamines) → 0.50586807  
   - `COc1ccccc1OCC(O)COC(N)=O` (complex ether/ester) → 0.01226347  

### Prediction for `CC(C)OC=O`:
- This is an **aliphatic ester** (isopropyl formate: `CH3-CH(OCH3)-C=O`). It lacks aromaticity or heavy halogens, resembling simple polar aliphatic compounds like `CC(C)O` (isopropanol, 1.21408337) or `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC` (phosphate ester, 1.21408337).  
- The presence of the ester group (`OC=O`) does not seem to deviate from the trend for aliphatic polar molecules in the dataset.  

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**1.21408337**
==================================================
Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular features.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs):**
   - Molecules with aromatic rings substituted with EWGs (e.g., Cl, Br, NO2, C=O) tend to have **negative property values**, often around **-0.674**.
   - Example: `Oc1ccccc1Cl` (-0.674), `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (-0.674), `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (-0.674).

2. **Aromatic Rings with Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs):**
   - Aromatic rings with EDGs (e.g., alkyl groups, OH, NH2) tend to have **less negative or slightly positive values**.
   - Example: `Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12` (-0.359), `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` (-0.502), `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` (-0.404).

3. **Non-Aromatic/Aliphatic Structures:**
   - Saturated or aliphatic structures (e.g., cyclohexane, alkanes, alcohols) tend to have **positive values**, often around **1.214**.
   - Example: `C1CCCCC1` (1.214), `OCC(O)CO` (1.214), `CCCCCO` (1.214).

4. **Amides and Ureas:**
   - Amides (`-CONH-`) and ureas (`-NHCONH-`) show **intermediate values**:
     - Simple amides: `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (-0.674, but this is likely due to the aromatic EWG effect dominating).
     - More complex amides/ureas: `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (0.741), `CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O` (0.584).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms of the urea core (`-NHCONH-`). Key features:
- The urea group (`-NHCONH-`) is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
- The two phenyl rings are unsubstituted (no EWGs or EDGs), so they are neutral in electronic effect but contribute to hydrophobicity.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
1. **Urea/Carbamate-Like Structures:**
   - `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (0.741) – cyclic urea with aliphatic groups.
   - `CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O` (0.584) – urea with aliphatic and carbonyl groups.
   - These suggest urea cores with non-aromatic substituents give **positive intermediate values (0.5–0.7)**.

2. **Aromatic Substituted Amides/Ureas:**
   - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (-0.674) – aromatic amide, but the pyridine ring is electron-deficient, skewing the value negatively.
   - `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` (-0.107) – aromatic carbamate with alkyl substituents (less negative than EWGs).

3. **Neutral Aromatic Rings:**
   - Unsubstituted phenyl rings (e.g., `c1ccncc1`, -0.674) tend to give negative values, but this may be due to the specific property being predicted (e.g., logP or solubility).

### Prediction:
The urea core with two neutral phenyl groups is likely to have a **less negative or slightly positive value** compared to aromatic EWGs but not as high as aliphatic structures. Given the examples:
- The closest analog is `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` (-0.107), but our molecule has two phenyl groups (more hydrophobic).
- The urea core's polarity may balance the hydrophobicity of the phenyl groups.

Thus, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted Property Value: -0.10 to 0.20**

Given the examples, I would predict:  
**0.0** (similar to `c1c(O)C2C(=O)C3cc(O)ccC3OC2cc1(OC)`, which also balances polar and aromatic features).

However, considering the urea examples with aliphatic groups (~0.5–0.7) and the aromatic examples (~-0.1 to -0.6), the phenyl groups likely reduce the value slightly.  

**Final Prediction: 0.0** (neutral balance).  

But reviewing again, `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` is -0.107, and our molecule is more aromatic, so perhaps slightly lower:  
**Adjusted Prediction: -0.10**  

Given the data, the most consistent estimate is:  
**-0.10** (similar to other aromatic amides/ureas).  

However, the urea core may push it closer to 0.0.  

After careful consideration:  
**Predicted Property Value: -0.10**  

But to align with the closest example (`CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` at -0.107), I will stick with:  
**-0.10**  

### Final Answer:  
**-0.10**

Iteration: 23
SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -0.5292158266662517
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question, **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (specifically, fluorene), I can make the following observations:

1. **Aromatic Systems**: Many aromatic systems (e.g., benzene rings, polycyclic aromatics) in the dataset tend to have negative property values, often around **-0.67449076** (e.g., `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`, `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`, `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1`, `Fc1cccc(F)c1`, `Sc1ccccc1`, `Brc1ccccc1`, `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1`). These are typically simple or halogenated aromatics.

2. **Fluorene-like Structures**: The given molecule is **fluorene**, which consists of two benzene rings fused to a cyclopentadiene ring. While not identical to the examples, it shares similarities with polycyclic aromatics like `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (which has a property value of **-0.67449076**).

3. **Substituent Effects**: The absence of electronegative substituents (e.g., halogens, nitro groups) or polar functional groups (e.g., carbonyl, amine) suggests the property value will likely be negative, similar to other unsubstituted polycyclic aromatics.

4. **Comparison to Other Examples**: 
   - `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` (property = -0.43841899) has aromatic rings but also polar amide and ether groups, making it less negative than pure aromatics.
   - `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (property = -0.67449076) is a pure polycyclic aromatic with no substituents, similar to fluorene.

### Prediction:
Given the strong similarity to other unsubstituted polycyclic aromatics in the dataset (which consistently have a property value of **-0.67449076**), the predicted property value for **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (fluorene) is:

True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O))**, which is polar and often associated with moderate to low property values in the examples (e.g., sulfonamides or similar polar groups tend to have values around **0.0 to 0.5**).
   - It also has **two amine groups (N and NC(=N))**, which add polarity and potential hydrogen bonding. Amines in the examples (e.g., **CNN** or **NNc1ccccc1**) are associated with values like **1.21408337** (for simple amines) or **-0.67449076** (for aromatic amines with electron-withdrawing effects).

2. **Aromatic Ring**:
   - The **para-substituted phenyl ring (c1ccc(N)cc1)** is present. Aromatic rings with polar substituents (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**) often have negative values (e.g., **-0.67449076**), while simpler alkyl-substituted aromatics (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1C**) have values around **-0.20234723**.

3. **Electron-Withdrawing and Donating Effects**:
   - The **sulfonamide (S(=O)(=O))** is electron-withdrawing, while the **amine (N)** on the ring is electron-donating. This push-pull effect may balance polarity, leading to a moderate value.

4. **Comparison to Similar Examples**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12** (a cyclic imide with aromaticity) has a value of **-0.67449076**.
   - **CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O** (a sulfonamide-like structure with heterocycle) has **-0.25480762**.
   - **N(CC)CC, 1.21408337** (simple aliphatic amines) have high values, but aromatic or polar-substituted amines trend lower.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of **polar sulfonamide**, **aromatic ring with amine**, and **guanidine-like (NC(=N)) group**, the molecule is likely to have a **moderate negative or near-zero value**. The closest analog is **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12** (**-0.67449076**), but the additional amine and sulfonamide here may raise the value slightly. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.25480762**  
(Similar to **CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O**, which also has a sulfonamide and aromatic system with polar substituents.)

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.051883904575122736
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, let's analyze the given molecule to predict its property value.

### Molecule to Predict:
**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Presence of Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O):**  
   - Molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative property values. For example:
     - `Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl` (no nitro): -0.674  
     - `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (one nitro): -0.674  
     - `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` (one nitro): -0.549  
     - `Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl` (no nitro): -0.674  
   - The presence of nitro groups correlates with more negative values (around -0.5 to -0.7).

2. **Fluorine Substituents (C(F)(F)F):**  
   - Fluorine substituents (especially CF3) are strongly electron-withdrawing and may further decrease the property value.  
   - Example: `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (two Cl): -0.255  
     Compared to `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1`: 0.135, the electron-withdrawing groups reduce the value.

3. **Aromatic System with Multiple Nitro Groups:**  
   - The given molecule has two nitro groups and a CF3 group on the aromatic ring, which will strongly pull electron density away, likely resulting in a more negative value.

4. **Alkylamine Substituent (CCN(CC(C)=C)):**  
   - Alkyl groups (e.g., CCN) can slightly increase the property value (e.g., `CCN(CC)c1ccccc1`: 0.081), but the strong electron-withdrawing effects of the nitro and CF3 groups will dominate.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`: One nitro group, property = -0.674.  
- `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O`: One nitro group, property = -0.549.  
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`: Two Cl groups, property = -0.255.  

The given molecule has **two nitro groups and a CF3 group**, which are even more electron-withdrawing than Cl. This suggests the property will be more negative than -0.549 but not as extreme as -0.674 (since the alkylamine may slightly offset the effect).

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing effects, the predicted property value is likely around **-0.55 to -0.60**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.58**  

This aligns with the trend observed in the examples where nitro groups and halogen substituents reduce the property value significantly.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.7419398354242547
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular structure.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **High Property Value (~1.21408337):**
   - Molecules with simple aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCCCO, ClC(Cl)Cl, BrCBr, C1CCCCCCC1).
   - Molecules with hydroxyl groups (e.g., OCC(O)C(O)CO, OC1CCCCCC1).
   - Molecules with no aromatic rings or significant electronegative substituents (e.g., CC(C)SC(C)C, CCC(C)(C)O).

2. **Intermediate Property Value (~0.5 to ~1.0):**
   - Molecules with carbonyl groups (C=O) in aliphatic chains (e.g., CC(=O)N ~0.2697963, CC(=O)N(S(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1)c2onc(C)c2C ~-0.23866596).
   - Molecules with esters or aldehydes (e.g., CC(C)CCOC=O ~0.89932101, O=C1CCCCC1 ~0.89932101).

3. **Low Property Value (~-0.67449076 or similar):**
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., c1ccccc1, Clc1ccccc1).
   - Molecules with conjugated systems or electronegative substituents (e.g., Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl, O2c1cc(C)ccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(N)cnc23).

### Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O**:
- The structure is **isopropyl formate** (an ester: R-O-C=O).
- It has an aliphatic chain (CC(C)) and a carbonyl group (C=O) but no aromaticity or highly electronegative substituents.
- Similar molecules in the examples:
  - **CC(C)CCOC=O** (property = 0.89932101): This is a similar ester with an aliphatic chain.
  - **O=C1CCCCC1** (property = 0.89932101): This is a cyclic ketone, also with a carbonyl group.
  - **CC(=O)N** (property = 0.2697963): This is an amide, slightly lower due to the nitrogen.

Given that **CC(C)OC=O** is an ester with a simple aliphatic group, its property value should be close to other aliphatic carbonyl compounds. The closest analog is **CC(C)CCOC=O** (0.89932101), which is also an aliphatic ester.

### Predicted Property for **CC(C)OC=O**:
The predicted property value is **0.89932101**. 

This is consistent with the trend where aliphatic carbonyl compounds (esters, ketones) without aromaticity or strong electronegative effects have intermediate property values in the ~0.5 to ~1.0 range.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.20234722784297857
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular features.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Negative Values (~ -0.674)**: 
   - These are often associated with molecules containing multiple aromatic rings (e.g., polycyclic aromatics like `c1ccc2ccccc2c1` or heavily halogenated aromatics like `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`). 
   - The presence of multiple halogens (Cl, Br) or conjugated systems seems to drive the property toward this extreme negative value.

2. **Moderately Negative Values (~ -0.4 to -0.45)**:
   - Seen in molecules with simpler aromatic systems and moderate substitutions (e.g., `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` or `Cc1cccc(N)c1`). 
   - Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) or extended conjugation without heavy halogenation also appear here.

3. **Near-Zero or Slightly Negative Values (~ -0.04 to -0.23)**:
   - Molecules with ester groups (`CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC`) or less conjugated systems.

4. **Positive Values (~ 1.214)**:
   - Small, non-aromatic, or aliphatic molecules (e.g., `CC(C)C`, `C1CCOC1`, `CO`). 
   - These lack aromaticity or conjugation and are often hydrocarbons or simple alcohols/ethers.

5. **Intermediate Positive Values (~ 0.08 to 0.76)**:
   - Larger aliphatic chains with some functionalization (e.g., `CCCCCCCC#C`) or partially conjugated systems (e.g., `CC12CCC(=O)C=C1CCC3C2CCC4(C)C3CCC4(O)C#C`).

### Analysis of **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**:
- The molecule is a **methyl- and hydroxy-substituted benzene** (toluene derivative with an OH group). 
- It has:
  - One aromatic ring.
  - Two methyl groups (`Cc1cc(C)...`) and one hydroxyl group (`...cc(O)c1`).
  - No halogens, nitro groups, or extended conjugation.
- Similar molecules in the examples:
  - `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (two methyl groups on benzene): Not explicitly listed, but close to `Cc1cccc(N)c1` (property = -0.404).
  - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol): Property = -0.674 (likely due to lack of substitutions).
  - `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` (multiple OH groups): Property = -0.438.

Given the **single aromatic ring with moderate substitutions (methyl and OH)**, the property is likely in the **moderately negative range**, similar to `Cc1cccc(N)c1` (-0.404) or `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` (-0.438). The hydroxyl group may slightly lower the value compared to just methyl groups.

### Predicted Property:
**-0.422** (close to the -0.404 to -0.438 range for similar substituted aromatics). 

This aligns with the trend where simple aromatic systems with polar substituents (OH) and small alkyl groups (CH3) have moderately negative values.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.08093889113719145
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular features.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **High Positive Values (~1.214):**
   - Molecules with simple aliphatic structures (e.g., **OC1CCCCC1**, **CC(C)C(C)(C)C**, **ClCC(Cl)(Cl)Cl**) or cyclic ethers (e.g., **C1CCOCC1**) tend to have high positive values (~1.214).
   - Nitro groups (e.g., **CCN(=O)=O**) or highly symmetric/aliphatic structures also correlate with this value.

2. **Intermediate Positive Values (~0.584 to ~0.930):**
   - Molecules with moderate complexity, such as alkenes with polar groups (e.g., **CCCC(O)C=C**, **CCC#CCC**) or steroids (e.g., **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C**), have intermediate positive values.

3. **Near-Zero or Slightly Negative Values (~-0.2 to ~0.1):**
   - Aromatic rings with simple substituents (e.g., **Cc1ccc(O)c(C)c1**, **Cc1ccc(O)cc1C**) or phosphoryl/thio groups (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl**) often have values around -0.2.

4. **Strongly Negative Values (~-0.674):**
   - Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., **Cl**, **NO2**, **CN**) or conjugated systems (e.g., **C=CC#N**, **C=CC=C**, **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1**) consistently show values around -0.674.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** has the following features:
- A **phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC))**, which appears in other molecules with values around **-0.2** (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl**).
- An **aromatic ring with a thioether (SC)** and a **methyl (C)** substituent. Thioethers are moderately electron-donating, similar to simple alkyl/alkoxy substituents in the examples.
- No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, NO2) that would push the value toward -0.674.

### Prediction:
The presence of the **phosphorothioate group** and **moderate aromatic substitution** suggests the property value is likely similar to other phosphoryl/thio-containing aromatics in the examples, which cluster around **-0.202**. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** is **-0.20234723**.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I notice that the property value tends to cluster around certain values for specific structural features. The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated biphenyl derivative with the structure:

**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**

Key observations from the training data:
1. Highly chlorinated aromatic systems (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl) consistently show a property value of **-0.67449076**.
2. The presence of multiple chlorine substituents on aromatic rings appears to drive the property toward this specific value.
3. The exact pattern of chlorination (ortho, meta, para) doesn't seem to affect this value as long as the molecule is heavily chlorinated.

Given that this molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl with 6 chlorine atoms in similar positions to the examples above, I predict it will have the same property value as the other heavily chlorinated aromatics in the dataset.

**Predicted property value: -0.67449076**
==================================================
Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain trends in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Simple alkanes (e.g., CCC, C1CCCCC1, CC) tend to have high values around 1.21408337
2. Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) often have negative values, typically -0.67449076
3. The presence of both aliphatic chains and nitro groups appears to result in intermediate values

For the molecule CCCN(=O)=O:
- It has a 3-carbon aliphatic chain (propyl group)
- It has a nitro group (N(=O)=O)

Looking at similar structures in the examples:
- N#Cc1ccccc1C#N (two nitrile groups) has -0.67449076
- O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (multiple nitro groups) has -0.67449076
- But CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has 0.34243377

The propyl chain is shorter than the hexyl chain in the last example, and we only have one nitro group. Considering the strong negative impact of nitro groups but the moderating effect of the alkyl chain, I would predict a value between the simple nitro compounds (-0.674) and the longer chain nitro compound (0.342).

A reasonable prediction would be approximately -0.2 to 0.0. Looking at similar examples, O=C1CNC(=O)N1 with similar complexity has -0.04496605.

Therefore, my predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O is: -0.04496605

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic rings with halogen substitutions (Cl, Br, F)** tend to have property values around **-0.67449076** or **-0.40469446**, depending on the specific substitution pattern.
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** → **-0.67449076**
   - Example: **COc1cccc(Cl)c1** → **-0.40469446**
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** → **-0.67449076**
   - Example: **c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12** → **-0.67449076**

2. The presence of **Br** and **F** on an aromatic ring (like in **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**) is structurally similar to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**, which has a value of **-0.67449076**.

3. The property seems to be more negative when the aromatic ring has multiple halogens or electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., **NO2**, **Cl**, **Br**, **F**).

### Prediction:
The molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is a halogen-substituted aromatic ring (fluorine and bromine), similar to other examples with **Cl** and **Br** substitutions that yield **-0.67449076**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is:

**-0.67449076**
==================================================
Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe the following patterns in the property values:

1. Simple aliphatic chains with halogens or oxygen (e.g., CBr, CCCCBr, CCC(C)(C)O) consistently have a property value of 1.21408337.

2. Complex cyclic structures with multiple heteroatoms or aromatic systems tend to have negative values, often -0.67449076 when they contain multiple aromatic rings or electronegative atoms in specific arrangements.

3. Structures with ketones or esters often have intermediate positive values (e.g., 0.74193984, 0.94428706).

4. Steroids and similar polycyclic structures with oxygen functionalities tend to have values around 0.7-0.9 (e.g., 0.74193984, 0.6990177).

The molecule in question is CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, which is a bicyclic structure with:
- Two fused cyclohexane rings
- Two tertiary methyl groups
- One hydroxyl group

This resembles the structural features of the steroids/polycyclic compounds in the examples (like CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO which had 0.74193984), but is simpler with fewer functional groups.

Given that:
- It's more complex than simple aliphatic chains (which get 1.21408337)
- But less complex than the full steroids (which get ~0.7-0.9)
- Contains one hydroxyl group but no ketones or other polar groups

I would predict an intermediate value between the simple aliphatics and the complex steroids. The closest analog in the examples is probably CC1CCCO1 (a simple cyclic ether) which got 1.21408337, but since this is bicyclic with more complexity, the value should be slightly lower.

A reasonable prediction would be: 0.94428706
(This matches the value seen for CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C which has similar complexity)

Final answer: 0.94428706

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.044966050631773065
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate or Phosphorodithioate Groups**: 
   - The molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** has a property value of **0.13489815**. This is structurally similar to the target molecule, with the main difference being the replacement of the **SC(CCl)** group with **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**.
   - The presence of **P(=S)** and aromatic rings seems to correlate with moderately positive property values (~0.1 to 0.6).

2. **Aromatic Rings with Carbonyl Groups**:
   - Molecules like **CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3ccccc23** (property = **-0.32038311**) and **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** (property = **-0.67449076**) have aromatic rings with carbonyl groups but lack the **P(=S)** moiety, leading to negative property values.
   - The **P(=S)** group appears to elevate the property value significantly compared to purely aromatic/carbonyl systems.

3. **Hybrid Structures**:
   - The target molecule combines **P(=S)** with an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group (similar to the phosphorodithioate example but with a slightly different linker). This suggests its property value should be close to the phosphorodithioate example but possibly slightly higher due to the more conjugated system (**N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** vs. **SC(CCl)**).

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property = **0.13489815**), but with a more conjugated and rigid aromatic/carbonyl system replacing the **SC(CCl)** group, the property value is likely slightly higher. 

**Predicted property value: 0.20** (rounded to two decimal places for clarity, though the exact value would depend on finer structural effects). 

However, looking back at the examples, the closest match is the phosphorodithioate structure with a value of **0.13489815**, and the target molecule's substitution may not drastically change this. Thus, a conservative estimate would be:

**Final predicted property value: 0.13489815** (same as the closest analogous example). 

But considering the **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** group is more polarizable than **SC(CCl)**, a slight increase is reasonable. 

**Adjusted prediction: ~0.15**. 

Given the examples, the most defensible answer is:

**Predicted property value: 0.13489815** (same as the closest match). 

If forced to provide a distinct value, I would estimate **0.14**. 

However, to align precisely with the given data, the property for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is likely:

**0.13489815**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on structural analogies from the provided examples.)

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -0.3311136455612377
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple aliphatic chains or rings (e.g., CCCCOC, CCCC(C)(C)C, C1CCCCCC1)** tend to have a property value of **1.21408337**.
2. **Aromatic systems with polar or electronegative substituents (e.g., C=O, N, O, Cl)** often have negative property values, typically around **-0.4 to -0.7**.
   - Example: **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** has a value of **-0.43841899** (contains C=O and N in an aromatic system).
   - Example: **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** has a value of **0.6990177** (contains multiple C=O and N but is less aromatic).
3. **Molecules with fused aromatic rings and heteroatoms (e.g., N, O)** often have values around **-0.5 to -0.7**.
   - Example: **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32** has a value of **-0.67449076** (fused aromatic with N).
   - Example: **O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** has a value of **-0.67449076** (two aromatic rings linked by C=O).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, which has:
- A fused aromatic system with two nitrogen atoms (n1 and n3).
- A carbonyl group (C=O) attached to the aromatic ring.
- Methyl substituents (Cc1 and n1C).
- A second aromatic ring (c2ccccc2) attached via a nitrogen.

This structure is similar to:
- **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (value = **-0.43841899**), which also has a fused aromatic system with N and C=O.
- **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32** (value = **-0.67449076**), which is a fused aromatic system with N.

Given the presence of the C=O and the fused aromatic N-heterocycle, the property value is likely closer to **-0.43841899** (similar to the first example above) rather than the more negative values seen in simpler fused aromatics.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.43841899** (same as the structurally similar example).

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.4384189936597869
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can identify patterns in the property values associated with certain molecular features. 

The molecule in question is **COC(=O)c1ccccc1**, which is **methyl benzoate**. 

Key observations from the examples:
1. **Aromatic esters** (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1) tend to have property values around **-0.25480762**.
   - Example: CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 → -0.25480762  
   - Example: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 → -0.25480762 (same scaffold as the query molecule but with an ethyl instead of methyl ester).  
2. The presence of a **benzoate (Ph-COOR)** moiety consistently correlates with this value, regardless of minor substitutions (e.g., -OCH3 vs. -OCH2CH3).  

Since the query molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is structurally very similar to these examples (only differing in the ester alkyl group), the predicted property value is:  

**Predicted property value: -0.25480762**  

This matches the trend observed for aromatic esters in the given data.
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.2967759341697019
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Simple alkanes and alkyl chains (e.g., C1CCCC1, CCC(C)(C)CC, CBr, CCN(=O)=O) tend to have high positive values around 1.214.

2. Molecules with conjugated double bonds or aromatic systems (e.g., C=Cc1ccccc1, c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34) tend to have negative values around -0.674.

3. The molecule C=CCC=C is a conjugated diene (buta-1,3-diene), which has a similar structure to other conjugated systems in the dataset that show negative values.

4. Comparing to similar structures:
   - C/C=C/C (a simple alkene) has a positive value (0.458)
   - C=Cc1ccccc1 (a conjugated system with aromatic ring) has -0.674
   - C=CCC=C is more similar to the latter in terms of conjugation.

Given that conjugated systems without bulky alkyl groups tend toward negative values in this dataset, and considering that butadiene is a classic conjugated system, the most reasonable prediction would be:

Predicted property value for C=CCC=C: -0.67449076

This matches the value seen for other conjugated/aromatic systems in the dataset.
==================================================
Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain numbers, particularly **1.21408337**, **-0.67449076**, **-0.40469446**, and intermediate values like **0.45865372** or **0.6990177**. 

Key observations:
1. **Highly halogenated aliphatic compounds** (e.g., `COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`, `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br`, `CC(C)CO`, `OCC(O)C(O)CO`) consistently have the property value **1.21408337**. These molecules often contain multiple halogens (Cl, Br, F) or polar functional groups (OH, PO).
2. **Aromatic systems with halogens or extended conjugation** (e.g., `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1`, `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1`, `c2cnc1ncncc1n2`) tend to have the value **-0.67449076**.
3. **Smaller or less polar molecules** (e.g., `Cc1cccc(C)n1`, `COc1cccc(Cl)c1`) often have intermediate negative values like **-0.40469446** or **-0.13489815**.

### Prediction for `BrC(Br)Br`:
This molecule is **tribromomethane (bromoform)**, a highly halogenated aliphatic compound with three bromine atoms. Based on the trend:
- Halogenated aliphatic compounds (especially with multiple heavy halogens like Br or Cl) consistently exhibit the property value **1.21408337**. Examples include:
  - `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` → 1.21408337  
  - `COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` → 1.21408337  
  - `CC(C)CO` (less halogenated but polar) → 1.21408337.  

Thus, the predicted property value for `BrC(Br)Br` is:  
**1.21408337**  

This aligns with the pattern that heavily halogenated or polar aliphatic structures tend to have this specific value.

Iteration: 39
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.13489815189531898
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: Present in the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**, which has a property value of **0.19715884**. This suggests that the presence of a phosphorothioate group may contribute to a value around this range.
2. **Aromatic rings (c1ccccc1)**: Aromatic systems are common in many of the examples, and their presence alone doesn't strongly push the value in a specific direction. However, when combined with other features, they may modulate the property.
3. **Chlorine substitution (C(CCl))**: Chlorine substituents are present in many molecules with negative property values (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** has **-0.67449076**), but this is not always the case (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** has **0.19715884**).
4. **Lactam/Carbonyl groups (N2C(=O)...C2=O)**: Cyclic amides (lactams) and carbonyls appear in some examples, but their influence seems secondary to other dominant features.
5. **Ethoxy groups (CCO)**: Alkoxy groups are present in some molecules, but their effect is not strongly indicative of a specific trend.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
The closest analog in the given examples is:
- **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** with a value of **0.19715884**. This molecule shares the phosphorothioate group and a chlorine substituent, though it lacks the aromatic lactam moiety.

Another somewhat similar molecule is:
- **CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O** with a value of **0.11241513**, which has an aromatic ring and a lactam-like structure.

### Synthesis of Observations:
The phosphorothioate group seems to pull the value toward the **0.1–0.2** range, while the aromatic lactam and chlorine substituent may slightly reduce it. There are no strongly electron-withdrawing or highly polar groups to push the value significantly higher or lower.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarities to the two molecules above, a reasonable estimate would be between **0.1 and 0.2**. Averaging the two closest examples (0.19715884 and 0.11241513) gives ~**0.15**, but considering the additional complexity of the target molecule, I would lean slightly lower.

**Final Prediction: 0.11241513**  
*(This matches the value of the somewhat similar molecule CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O, which seems like a reasonable fit.)*

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.08093889113719145
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the provided examples to infer the likely property value.

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Amide group**: **C(=O)N** (similar to **CN(C)C(=O)C** and **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** in the examples, which have values of **0.74193984** and **0.83636854**, respectively).
2. **Aromatic ring with chlorine substitution**: **c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)** (similar to **Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, which has a value of **-0.67449076**, but the presence of other groups here may modulate this).
3. **Heterocyclic group with nitrogen and oxygen**: **n2nc(oc2=O)** (similar to **Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23**, which has a value of **-0.46464919**).
4. **Bulky tert-butyl group**: **C(C)(C)C** (similar to **CCC(C)C**, which has a value of **1.21408337**, but this is likely offset by other polar groups).
5. **Polar and electron-withdrawing groups**: The **C(=O)N** and **Cl** substituents will reduce hydrophobicity, while the **tert-butyl** group increases it.

### Observations from Examples:
- Molecules with **amides** and **polar groups** tend to have values in the range of **0.2 to 0.8** (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)C = 0.74193984**, **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C = 0.83636854**).
- **Chlorinated aromatics** often have very low values (e.g., **-0.67449076**), but when combined with other polar groups, the effect is less extreme.
- The **heterocyclic** component (**n2nc(oc2=O)**) is somewhat similar to the **thiazole** in **Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23** (**-0.46464919**), but the presence of the **tert-butyl** group and **amide** will push the value higher.

### Synthesis of Trends:
The molecule is a mix of:
1. **Polar/amide contribution (~0.7)**,
2. **Chlorinated aromatic (~-0.4 to -0.6)**,
3. **Heterocycle (~-0.4)**,
4. **Bulky alkyl group (~+1.2, but dampened by other groups)**.

Averaging these (with more weight given to the polar/amide and chlorinated aromatic contributions), the predicted value is likely in the range of **0.2 to 0.4**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the balance of these features, the predicted property value is:  
**0.37471709** (similar to **Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2**, which also has polar and aromatic components).  

However, considering the stronger electron-withdrawing effects of the **Cl** and **C(=O)N** groups, a slightly lower value may be more appropriate.  

After careful consideration, the most reasonable prediction is:  
**0.20684383** (similar to **CCCC1COC(Cn2cncn2)(O1)c3ccc(Cl)cc3Cl**, which also combines polar, aromatic, and bulky features).  

But given the strong amide contribution, a value closer to **0.3** is plausible.  

### Final Answer:  
**0.27689621** (intermediate between the amide and chlorinated aromatic influences).  

However, reviewing the examples again, the closest structural analog is **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (**0.83636854**), but with the added **Cl** and heterocycle pulling the value down. Thus, a compromise is:  

**Predicted property value: 0.37471709** (matching the polar/amide-dominated examples).  

But to be precise, given the **Cl** and heterocycle, a slight reduction is warranted:  

**Final predicted value: 0.25480762** (similar to **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**).  

After further reflection, the best match is:  

**Predicted value: 0.20684383** (balancing all features).  

### Conclusion:  
The predicted property value for **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C** is:  
**0.27689621**.  

(Note: Without explicit knowledge of the property being predicted, this is an inferred estimate based on structural similarity to the provided examples.)

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl`, we can observe the following patterns:

1. **Aromatic rings with multiple halogens (Cl, Br, etc.) and hydroxyl (OH) groups** tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**. Examples:
   - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` → -0.67449076
   - `c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2` → -0.67449076
   - `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` → -0.67449076
   - `O=N(=O)c1c(Cl)c(Cl)ccc1` → -0.67449076
   - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` → -0.67449076

2. The molecule `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl` fits this pattern well:
   - It contains two aromatic rings.
   - Each ring has multiple chlorine (Cl) substitutions.
   - It also has hydroxyl (OH) groups attached to the aromatic rings.

3. The presence of multiple halogens and hydroxyl groups on aromatic systems consistently correlates with the value **-0.67449076** in the given examples.

Thus, the predicted property value for `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl` is:

**-0.67449076**
==================================================
Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.4586537164440847
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe certain trends in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **Simple alkanes and alkenes** tend to have positive property values, often higher when they are larger or more branched. For example:
   - `CC/C=C/C` has a value of **0.45865372**.
   - `CCCC(C)C` has a value of **1.21408337**.

2. **Conjugated systems or aromatic rings with polar substituents** (e.g., carbonyl, nitro, or halogen groups) tend to have negative property values. For example:
   - `O=Cc1ccccc1` has a value of **-0.67449076**.
   - `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a value of **-0.67449076**.

3. **Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br, I)** often have very high positive values (e.g., **1.21408337**) unless they are part of an aromatic system, where the value tends to be negative.

4. **The presence of double bonds** in non-aromatic systems (like alkenes) gives intermediate positive values (e.g., **0.45865372** for `CC/C=C/C`).

### Prediction for `CC/C=C\C`:
The molecule `CC/C=C\C` is a simple alkene (2-pentene, with a trans configuration implied by the `/` and `\` symbols). It is structurally very similar to `CC/C=C/C` (which has a value of **0.45865372**), differing only in the stereochemistry of the double bond (cis vs. trans). 

Since stereochemistry does not appear to significantly alter the property in the given examples (no clear stereochemical trends are evident), we can reasonably predict that `CC/C=C\C` will have a property value **very close to that of `CC/C=C/C`**.

### Final Prediction:
**0.45865372** (same as `CC/C=C/C`, as stereochemistry is unlikely to drastically change the property in this case).

True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property value tends to cluster around certain values, with **1.21408337** being a very common value for simple, non-aromatic, and non-halogenated hydrocarbons or alcohols. For example:

- **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): 1.21408337  
- **C** (methane): 1.21408337  
- **CCC(O)CC** (pentan-3-ol): 1.21408337  
- **C1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexane): 1.21408337  
- **CCSSCC** (a simple thioether): 1.21408337  

The molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether) is a simple, non-aromatic, non-halogenated ether with no strongly polar or electronegative substituents (like halogens or nitro groups) that would significantly alter the property value. Structurally, it resembles other simple aliphatic compounds (e.g., alcohols, hydrocarbons) that consistently have the value **1.21408337**.

### Predicted property value for **CCCOCC**:  
**1.21408337**
==================================================
Iteration: 44
SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.23012037676260308
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **High Property Values (~1.21408337)**:
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCCC`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCO`, `C`).
   - Aliphatic alcohols or ethers (e.g., `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O`, `OC1CCCCC1`).
   - No aromatic rings or polar/electron-withdrawing groups.

2. **Low Property Values (~-0.67449076)**:
   - Aromatic rings with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro `N(=O)=O`, sulfonyl `S(=O)(=O)`, halogens like `Cl`, `Br`).
   - Heterocycles with polar groups (e.g., `N=CNS1(=O)=O`, `n2ncc(N)c(Br)c2(=O)`).

3. **Intermediate Property Values**:
   - Aromatic rings with moderate substitution (e.g., `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` → `-0.40469446`).
   - Polar groups like esters or amides (e.g., `CCOC(=O)CC(=O)OCC` → `0.67449076`).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**  
- Structure: 
  - Two aromatic rings (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`).
  - Tertiary amide group (`N(C(=O)N...)`).
  - Bulky tert-butyl-like group (`NC(C)(C)...`).

### Key Features:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: Presence of two phenyl rings suggests a lower property value (similar to other aromatic systems).
2. **Amide Group**: The `N(C=O)N` group is polar but not as strongly electron-withdrawing as nitro or sulfonyl groups.
3. **No Strong Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: Unlike the low-value examples, this lacks `NO2`, `SO2`, or halogens directly on the ring.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` → `-0.40469446` (two aromatic rings, no strong EWGs).
- `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` → `-0.43841899` (amide + aromatic rings).
- `CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1` → `-0.10791852` (amide + aromatic ring).

The target molecule has two aromatic rings and a bulky amide, similar to these examples but with slightly less polarity than `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3`. Thus, its value should be slightly higher (less negative) than `-0.43841899`.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to molecules with values around `-0.4` to `-0.1`, and considering the bulky but non-polar tert-butyl-like group, the predicted value is approximately **`-0.35`**.

However, looking more closely, the molecule is very similar to `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` (`-0.43841899`), but with a less polar `NC(C)(C)` group instead of `COc1nc2ccccc2s1`. This would make it slightly less negative, so a reasonable estimate is **`-0.40`**.

But in the examples, `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (two plain phenyl rings) is `-0.40469446`, and our target has an additional amide group (which adds polarity but not as strongly as nitro/sulfonyl). Thus, the value should be similar or slightly more negative. 

Given the variability, the closest match is **`-0.40469446`**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is **`-0.40469446`**.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.4384189936597869
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular features.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWG):**
   - Molecules with aromatic rings substituted with strong EWGs (e.g., NO₂, Br, Cl, F, C=O) tend to have property values around **-0.67449076**.
     - Examples: 
       - `c1ccccc1n2ncc(N)c(Br)c2(=O)`: -0.67449076
       - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1`: -0.67449076
       - `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`: -0.67449076
       - `Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1`: -0.67449076
       - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`: -0.67449076
       - `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1`: -0.67449076

2. **Aromatic Rings with Electron-Donating Groups (EDG):**
   - Molecules with aromatic rings substituted with EDGs (e.g., OH, NH₂, alkyl groups) tend to have less negative or slightly positive values.
     - Examples:
       - `Cc1cccc(C)c1C`: -0.04496605
       - `Cc1ccc(O)cc1C`: -0.20234723
       - `Cc1ccc(N)cc1`: -0.40469446

3. **Amide Groups (-CONH-):**
   - Molecules with amide groups (especially aromatic amides) often have intermediate negative values (not as extreme as -0.67449076).
     - Examples:
       - `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`: -0.23012038
       - `OC(C(=O)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`: -0.53959261

4. **Combination of Amide + Aromatic + EWG:**
   - The molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** has:
     - An amide group (`CC(=O)N-`).
     - An aromatic ring substituted with a strong EWG (Br).
     - This is similar to `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (-0.67449076) but with an additional amide group, which may moderate the effect.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- The presence of Br on the aromatic ring would push the value toward -0.67449076.
- The amide group (`CC(=O)N-`) is not as strongly electron-withdrawing as NO₂ or C=O directly on the ring, so it may not drive the value as low as -0.67449076.
- Similar molecules with amides and EWGs (e.g., `OC(C(=O)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`) have values around -0.53959261.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is likely between -0.53959261 and -0.67449076. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.53959261** (similar to the amide + aromatic EWG trend). 

However, since the Br is directly on the ring (like many -0.67449076 examples), but the amide is not as strongly withdrawing, the value may be slightly less negative. 

Alternatively, if the amide has a stronger moderating effect, it could be closer to -0.40469446 (like `Cc1ccc(N)cc1`). 

Given the examples, the safest prediction is:  
**-0.53959261** (aligning with the amide + EWG trend). 

But if forced to pick from the most common values in the examples, **-0.67449076** is also plausible (since Br is a strong EWG). 

Given the uncertainty, I would lean toward:  
**-0.53959261** as the more nuanced prediction. 

### Final Answer:
**-0.53959261**
==================================================
Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.08093889113719145
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular structure.

### Observations:
1. **Aliphatic Chains with OH or Similar Groups**: 
   - Molecules like `CC(C)CO`, `CCCCC(O)CC`, `CC1CCCCC1`, `CCCC(C)O`, `CC(C)CCO`, and `ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl` all have a property value of **1.21408337**. These typically contain simple aliphatic chains with polar groups (e.g., -OH) or fully halogenated alkanes.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents**:
   - Molecules like `Cc1ccccc1N` (toluene with -NH2) have a value of **-0.40469446**.
   - `Cc1ccccc1` (toluene) is not explicitly given, but similar structures like `C=Cc1ccccc1` (styrene) and `N#Cc1ccccc1` (phenylacetonitrile) have **-0.67449076**.
   - `CCc1ccc(C)cc1` (ethyltoluene) has **-0.04496605**.
   - `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1` (isopropyltoluene) has **0.08093889**.

3. **Branched Alkyl-Aromatic Systems**:
   - The molecule `CC(C)Cc1ccccc1` is **isopropylbenzene (cumene)**, which has a branched alkyl group (isopropyl) attached to a benzene ring. This is similar to `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1` (isopropyltoluene), which has a property value of **0.08093889**.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1` (isopropyltoluene), which has a property value of **0.08093889**, and considering that `CC(C)Cc1ccccc1` (cumene) is a simpler analog (no methyl on the ring), the property value is likely in the same range. 

However, since cumene lacks the additional ring methyl substituent (which might slightly lower the value), the property could be marginally higher. From the examples, the closest match is **0.08093889**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is **0.08093889**.

Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities:

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic rings with polar substituents** tend to have negative property values, especially if the substituents are electron-withdrawing (e.g., nitro groups, halogens, carbonyls). Examples:
   - **Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1**: -0.674  
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O**: -0.674  
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: -0.674  
   - **c1cncnc1**: -0.674  

2. **Benzene derivatives with a carbonyl group (C=O)** directly attached to the ring (like benzaldehyde) appear in the examples with a property value of **-0.674**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + hydroxyl): -0.674  
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (imide): -0.549 (slightly less negative due to additional aromatic rings).  

3. **Non-aromatic or less polar molecules** (e.g., alkanes, alkenes, alcohols) tend to have positive property values.  

### Prediction:
The molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde) has a **carbonyl group directly attached to a benzene ring**, similar to other examples with a property value of **-0.674**. No additional functional groups are present to significantly alter this value.  

### Final Answer:

Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.4384189936597869
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly negative values (~ -0.674)** are associated with:
   - Aromatic rings with multiple electronegative substituents (e.g., Cl, Br, NO₂).
   - Heterocycles with nitrogen or oxygen (e.g., pyridine-like structures, fused rings with electronegative atoms).
   - Molecules with nitro groups (NO₂) or heavy halogens (Cl, Br).

2. **Positive values (~ 1.214)** are associated with:
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., CCO, CCCCCl, BrCCBr).
   - Non-aromatic, non-polar, or minimally functionalized structures.

3. **Intermediate values (between -0.5 and 0.5)** are associated with:
   - Moderately polar or mixed aromatic/aliphatic structures.
   - Molecules with fewer electronegative substituents or balanced polar/non-polar regions.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The given molecule has the following features:
- A **fused heterocyclic system** with two amide (N-C=O) groups and a nitro (NO₂) group.
- An **aromatic ring** with an oxygen (furan-like) and a nitro substituent.
- The structure resembles some of the examples with nitro groups and heterocycles, which tend to have **negative property values**.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2**: Nitro group + aromatic + halogens → **-0.674**.
- **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**: Fused heterocycle + electronegative atoms → **-0.674**.
- **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1**: Aromatic + polar groups → **-0.674**.

The target molecule has:
- A nitro group (like many -0.674 examples).
- A fused heterocycle (like some -0.674 examples).
- No heavy halogens, but the nitro group and polar amides dominate.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong similarity to molecules with nitro groups and fused heterocycles (all scoring **-0.674**), the predicted property value for **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2** is:

**-0.67449076** (same as the recurring value for such structures). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.67449076**
==================================================
Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question (`N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`), I observe the following patterns:

1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen**: Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) and nitrogen substitutions (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1`, `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`) tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**. This is seen in:
   - `Nc1ccccc1` → -0.67449076
   - `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` → -0.67449076
   - `c2ccc1[nH]ncc1c2` → -0.67449076
   - `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)C(C)C` → 0.64751113 (this is an exception due to the bulky aliphatic groups and carbonyls).

2. **Structure of the Query Molecule**: The molecule `N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` is structurally similar to `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (both have two aromatic rings linked by a nitrogen-containing functional group). The only difference is the substitution pattern (`N(N` vs. `N(=N`), but the aromatic systems dominate the property.

3. **Consistency in Aromatic Nitrogen Systems**: Even with variations like bromine substitutions (`Brc1ccccc1`) or fused rings (`c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3c2ccc4c5ccccc5ccc43`), the property remains **-0.67449076** as long as the core is aromatic with nitrogen.

### Predicted Property:
Given the consistency of **-0.67449076** for aromatic nitrogen systems, the predicted property for `N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` is:

**-0.67449076**

Iteration: 50
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 0.5058680696074463
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure (cyclohexane-like ring, **CCCC1**). 
   - It is a bicyclic system with two fused rings: one is a cyclohexane, and the other is a diketopiperazine-like ring (formed by the two amides).

2. **Similarity to Examples**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = 0.6990177): This is a structurally similar molecule with a diketopiperazine core and alkyl substituents. The presence of the diketopiperazine and alkyl groups seems to correlate with a moderately positive property value (~0.7).
   - **O=C1CCCN1** (property = 0.74193984): This is a simpler lactam (cyclic amide), and its property is also positive (~0.74), suggesting that cyclic amides tend to have positive values.
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = 0.74193984): Another diketopiperazine derivative with a positive value (~0.74).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Cyclic amides (lactams, diketopiperazines) with alkyl or non-polar substituents tend to have property values in the range of **0.7 to 0.74**.
   - The molecule in question is a diketopiperazine fused to a cyclohexane ring, which is structurally similar to the examples above but with slightly less branching (no extra alkyl groups beyond the cyclohexane). This might slightly lower the value compared to the more substituted examples.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to the examples with values around **0.7 to 0.74**, and considering the lack of additional branching (which might reduce the value slightly), a reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 0.69**  

This is close to the value of **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC (0.6990177)** but slightly lower due to the simpler substitution pattern. 

### Final Answer:
**0.69**

Iteration: 51
SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I can observe certain patterns in the property values:

1. Simple halogenated aromatic compounds (e.g., Clc1ccccc1Cl, Ic1ccccc1) consistently show a property value of -0.67449076.

2. The molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with three chlorine substituents. 

3. Looking at similar complex halogenated aromatics in the examples:
   - Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a value of -0.40469446
   - Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O has -0.54858582

4. The given PCB structure is more similar to simple halogenated aromatics than the more complex examples, but with slightly more complexity than mono/di-halogenated benzenes.

Given these observations and the consistent pattern for halogenated aromatics, I would predict the property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl to be intermediate between the simple halogenated benzene value (-0.67449076) and the more complex polychlorinated structures (-0.40469446).

My predicted value would be: -0.54858582

This matches the value seen for another somewhat complex chlorinated aromatic system in the examples. The three chlorines and biphenyl structure would likely have a similar effect on the property as the example with the similar complexity level.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.08093889113719145
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities between the provided molecules and their corresponding property values.

### Observations:
1. **Simple alkyl-substituted aromatic compounds** tend to have property values around **0.2697963** (e.g., **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** and **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**).
   - The molecule **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene) has a value of **0.2697963**.
   - The molecule **Cc1ccccc1N** (toluidine) has a value of **-0.40469446**, but this includes an amine group, which likely lowers the value.

2. **Diethylbenzene (CCc1ccc(CC)cc1)** is structurally similar to **hexylbenzene (CCCCCCc1ccccc1)** but with two ethyl groups instead of one hexyl group. Both are neutral, non-polar aromatic hydrocarbons with alkyl substituents.

3. The presence of **alkyl chains (ethyl or hexyl)** without strongly polar or functional groups seems to correlate with values around **0.2697963**.

### Conclusion:
Since **diethylbenzene** is a simple alkyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon like **hexylbenzene**, its property value is likely similar. No strongly polar or electronegative groups are present to significantly alter the value.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.2697963** (same as hexylbenzene and other simple alkyl-aromatics in the dataset).

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (NO₂)**: 
   - Molecules with nitro groups (e.g., `N(=O)=O`) often have property values around **-0.67449076** (e.g., `Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12`, `Oc1ccncc1`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`).
   - However, some nitro-containing molecules deviate from this (e.g., `Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` has **-0.40469446**).

2. **Sulfonamide Groups (S(=O)(=O)N)**:
   - The molecule `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O` contains a sulfonamide group (`S(N)(=O)=O`), which is somewhat analogous to nitro groups in terms of electronegativity and polarity. 
   - Sulfonamides are not explicitly present in the examples, but nitro groups (which are also strongly electron-withdrawing) suggest a trend toward negative property values.

3. **Aromatic Systems with Electron-Withdrawing Groups**:
   - Aromatic rings with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, sulfonamide) tend to have negative property values (often **-0.67449076**).
   - Examples: `Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12`, `Oc1ccncc1`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`, `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`.

4. **Specific Case of `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O`**:
   - This is an aromatic amine (`Nc1ccc(cc1)`) with a sulfonamide group attached to the ring. 
   - The sulfonamide is strongly electron-withdrawing, similar to nitro groups, and the aromatic amine is also polar but less electron-withdrawing than nitro/sulfonamide.
   - The closest analog in the examples is `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`, which has a property value of **-0.67449076**.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (aromatic amine + strong electron-withdrawing group), the property value for `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O` is likely very similar. 

Thus, the predicted property value is:

### Observations:
1. **Highly halogenated (Cl, Br) or sulfur-containing aromatic systems** tend to have a property value around **-0.67449076** (e.g., Cl/Br-substituted benzenes, thiophenes like `Sc2nc1ccccc1s2`).
2. **Simple aliphatic hydrocarbons (cyclic or linear)** tend to have a value of **1.21408337** (e.g., `C1CCCC1`, `CCCCBr`).
3. **Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)** with extended conjugation and no heteroatoms/halogens often have values around **-0.67449076** (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54`).

### Target Molecule:
The molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** is a **polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)** with four fused benzene rings (a phenanthrene-like structure). It has:
- No heteroatoms (O, N, S, etc.).
- No halogens (Cl, Br).
- Pure hydrocarbon aromatic system.

### Matching Examples:
- `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` (a larger PAH) has **-0.67449076**.
- `Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` (halogenated PAH) also has **-0.67449076**.
- Simpler PAHs like `Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32` have values closer to **-0.5 to -0.6**, but larger PAHs trend toward **-0.67449076**.

### Conclusion:
The molecule is a **pure PAH with no substituents**, similar to other PAHs in the dataset that consistently show the property value **-0.67449076**.

Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule, I can identify some patterns in the property values:

1. The property value of 1.21408337 appears frequently for simple halogenated alkanes (e.g., ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl, ClCCl), alcohols (e.g., CCCC(C)O), and other relatively simple aliphatic compounds.

2. Negative values around -0.67 appear for aromatic compounds with multiple rings and some electronegative substituents (e.g., Fc1ccccc1, o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13).

3. Intermediate values between 0 and 1 appear for more complex structures with mixed functional groups.

The target molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 is a complex polyphenolic structure with:
- Multiple aromatic rings
- Multiple hydroxyl groups
- A carbonyl group
- Ether linkage

Looking at similar complex aromatic compounds in the examples:
- OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl has -0.563
- OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O has -0.486
- OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O has 1.214 (but this is an aliphatic sugar)

Given that our target has even more hydroxyl groups and aromatic character than most of these, I would predict it should have a property value similar to or more negative than these examples.

The most similar examples suggest values around -0.5 to -0.6. Considering the additional hydroxyl groups might make it slightly more negative, I'll predict:

Predicted property value: -0.58006205

(This matches exactly with one of the similar examples: Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 which has the same value, and has comparable structural features)

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 0.7419398354242547
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular features.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkyl Halides (e.g., CCCCC, CCCCBr, CCCI)**: These tend to have a property value of **1.21408337**, suggesting that simple hydrophobic chains or halides contribute to higher values.
2. **Esters/Carbonyl-Containing (e.g., CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, CCCCCC(=O)OC)**: These have slightly lower values (~1.0042418, 0.94428706), indicating that polar carbonyl groups reduce the property.
3. **Aromatic Rings with Electron-Withdrawing Groups (e.g., Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O)**: These have negative values (~-0.40469446), suggesting strong electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro) lower the property significantly.
4. **Phosphorus-Containing Groups (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl)**: These tend to have negative or moderately negative values (~-0.20234723, -0.29677593), indicating that phosphorus (especially with sulfur or chlorine) reduces the property.
5. **Heterocycles (e.g., Cn1cnc2n(C)c(=O)[nH]c(=O)c12, Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1)**: These often have negative values (~-0.13489815, -0.67449076), especially if they contain polar or hydrogen-bonding groups.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** has the following features:
- A **phosphoryl group (P=O)** with mixed substituents (O-alkyl, N-acetyl, and S-alkyl).
- An **N-acetyl group (NC(C)=O)**, which is polar and hydrogen-bonding.
- A **thioether (S-alkyl)** group, which is less polar than oxygen but still polarizable.

Given the presence of:
- Phosphorus (P=O) with polar substituents (similar to other phosphorus-containing molecules with negative values).
- N-acetyl group (similar to other polar/amide-containing molecules with negative values).
- No strong hydrophobic chains (like long alkanes) to offset the polarity.

### Comparison to Closest Examples:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = -0.20234723 (phosphorothioate with aromatic/chlorine).
- **COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = -0.29677593 (phosphoryl with chlorine/aromatic).
- **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**: Property = 1.07918522 (phosphorodithioate with long alkyl chains, which seems anomalous but may be due to the long hydrophobic chains offsetting the polarity).

The target molecule lacks long hydrophobic chains and has polar groups (P=O, N-acetyl, S-alkyl), so it is more similar to the first two examples with negative values. However, the N-acetyl group is less electron-withdrawing than nitro or chlorine, so the value may not be as negative as -0.67449076.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate for **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** is:  
**-0.29677593** (similar to phosphoryl-containing molecules with moderate polarity).

### Final Answer:
**-0.29677593**
==================================================
Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Simple alkanes, cycloalkanes, and alcohols (e.g., CC1CCCC1, CCCCO, CCCC(C)C) tend to have a property value of ~1.214.
2. Molecules with conjugated systems, aromatic rings, or multiple heteroatoms often have negative values around -0.674.
3. Molecules with carbonyl groups (C=O) or amides tend to have intermediate values between 0 and 1.
4. Halogenated compounds (especially with Cl) often have negative values when combined with aromatic systems, but simple halogenated alkenes aren't present in the examples.

For the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl (trans-1,2-dichloroethene):
- It's a simple halogenated alkene without conjugation or aromaticity
- The presence of two chlorines might decrease the property value compared to simple alkanes
- There are no direct analogs in the examples, but comparing to similar structures suggests a value between 0.5 and 1.0

The most reasonable prediction based on structural similarity to CCC=O (0.584) and CCCC(=C)C (0.584) would be:

Predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl: 0.58455866

Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Simple aliphatic chains with halogens or alcohols (e.g., CCCC(C)(C)CO, BrC(Cl)Cl) consistently show the value 1.21408337.

2. Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups (NO2, multiple halogens) or extended conjugation tend to show -0.67449076.

3. Pyridine and similar nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., COc2ncc1nccnc1n2, Cc1ncnc2nccnc12) show -0.40469446.

The molecule in question is pyridine (c1ccncc1), which is a simple nitrogen-containing heterocycle similar to several examples in the dataset that show -0.40469446.

Therefore, the predicted property value for pyridine (c1ccncc1) is: -0.40469446

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: -0.37629484476062686
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **High Property Values (~1.214)**:
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCC**, **CCCCCOC(=O)CC**, **CSC**, **BrC(Br)Br**).
   - Small polar molecules (e.g., **C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**).
   - Halogenated aliphatics (e.g., **ClCCCl**, **ClCBr**).

2. **Intermediate Property Values (~0.1 to ~0.9)**:
   - Esters, ethers, and carbonyls (e.g., **COC1=CC(=O)CC(C)C13Oc2c(Cl)c(OC)cc(OC)c2C3=O**, **CCCCC(=O)OC**).
   - Amides and nitriles (e.g., **CC(=O)N**, **ClCC#N**).

3. **Low/Negative Property Values (~-0.04 to ~-0.67)**:
   - Aromatic systems, especially polycyclic (e.g., **c1ccc2cnccc2c1**, **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**).
   - Nitro groups (e.g., **Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O**).
   - Conjugated systems with halogens (e.g., **Cl\C=C/Cl**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23** has:
1. **Aliphatic polyol segment (OCC(O)CO-)**: This resembles **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (property = 1.214), suggesting a contribution toward higher values.
2. **Aromatic ester (-OC(=O)c1ccccc1-)**: Similar to **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC** (property = -0.045), but with additional complexity.
3. **Aromatic amine linkage (-Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23-)**: The presence of a nitrogen in a conjugated system (like **Nc2ccnc3**) and a chloro-substituted aromatic ring (similar to **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**, property = -0.674) suggests a pull toward lower values.
4. **Overall conjugation**: The extended conjugation across the aromatic systems and the ester-amine linkage likely reduces the property value.

### Balancing Contributions:
- The aliphatic polyol part would push the value higher (~1.214), but the aromatic/heteroaromatic and conjugated systems dominate, pulling it toward negative values (like **-0.674** or **-0.404**).
- The closest analog is **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccccc2** (not in the examples, but similar to **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC**, property = -0.045), but with more aromatic/N-containing complexity.

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong aromatic/conjugated influence, the predicted value is likely in the **lower range**, similar to other polyaromatic systems. A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.33111365** (matching examples like **c2c(C)cc1nc(C)ccc1c2** or **CC(OC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1)C#C**).

### Final Answer:
**-0.33111365**

Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain trends in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **Hydrocarbon chains** (especially alkanes and alcohols) tend to have higher property values:
   - `CC(C)(C)C` (isobutane) → 1.21408337
   - `CCCCCCCI` (iodohexane) → 1.21408337
   - `OC1CCCCCCC1` (cyclooctanol) → 1.21408337
   - `C1CCC2CCCCC2C1` (decalin) → 1.21408337

2. **Oxygen-containing functional groups** (ethers, esters, carbonyls) often reduce the property value but not drastically:
   - `CCOC=O` (ethyl formate) → 0.58455866
   - `COC=O` (methyl formate) → 0.2697963

3. **Polar or aromatic systems** with halogens, nitro groups, or heterocycles tend to have negative property values:
   - `O=N(=O)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1` → -0.67449076
   - `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` → -0.67449076

4. **Alcohols** with simple hydrocarbon chains tend to have high property values:
   - `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (tertiary alcohol) → 1.21408337
   - `OC1CCCCCCC1` (cyclooctanol) → 1.21408337

### Prediction for `CCCCCO` (1-pentanol):
- This is a simple aliphatic alcohol with a 5-carbon chain. 
- Based on the trend for alcohols (`OH` group) and hydrocarbon chains, this molecule should have a **high property value**, similar to other alkanes/alcohols in the dataset (e.g., `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` → 1.21408337, `OC1CCCCCCC1` → 1.21408337).
- The chain length is moderate (5 carbons), but the presence of the hydroxyl group aligns it with other high-value examples.

### Predicted property value:
**1.21408337** (same as other simple alcohols/hydrocarbons in the dataset).

Iteration: 61
SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: -0.20234722784297857
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, here's the reasoning for the predicted property value:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens, nitro, sulfonyl)** tend to have **negative property values** (often **-0.67449076**). Examples:
   - `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` → -0.67449076  
   - `Fc1ccc(F)cc1` → -0.67449076  
   - `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` → -0.67449076  

2. **Sulfonyl groups (`S(=O)(=O)`)** appear in molecules with **moderate or negative values**, especially when combined with aromatic systems (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` → 0.08093889).  

3. **Amide groups (`C(=O)N`)** are present in molecules with **variable values**, but when attached to aromatic rings, they often correlate with **negative or near-zero values** (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1` → -0.43841899).  

4. **Heterocyclic systems with aromaticity** (e.g., pyridine, thiophene) often have **-0.67449076** if they lack strong polar substituents.  

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1** has:
- A **benzene ring** (electron-rich, but with an amide substituent).  
- A **sulfonyl group (`S(=O)(=O)`)** attached to a heterocycle (dihydrothiophene-like ring).  
- An **amide group (`C(=O)N`)** linked to the aromatic ring.  
- No strongly electron-donating groups (e.g., `OH`, `NH2`) to offset the electron-withdrawing effects.  

Given the prevalence of sulfonyl + aromatic systems in the examples with **negative or near-zero values**, and the lack of strong balancing donors, the property value is likely **negative**. The closest matches are molecules like `O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (-0.54858582) or `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1` (-0.43841899).  

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.54858582**  
*(This aligns with the trend for aromatic + sulfonyl + amide systems in the examples.)*

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: -0.11902778108410503
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them with the provided examples to identify patterns or trends in the property values.

### Given Molecule:
**SMILES:** `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C`

### Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic ring with nitro group (`c2ccccc2N(=O)=O`):**  
   - Examples with nitro groups on aromatic rings:
     - `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` → **-0.40469446**
     - `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` → **0.34243377**
   - Nitro groups seem to introduce negative values unless balanced by other features (e.g., aliphatic chains or electron-donating groups).

2. **Ester groups (`COC(=O)` and `C(=O)OC`):**  
   - Examples with esters:
     - `CCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC` → **0.58455866**
     - `CCCCC(=O)OC` → **0.89932101**
   - Esters tend to increase the property value, especially when attached to aliphatic chains.

3. **Substituted heterocycle (`C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1...)C`):**  
   - Similar to structures like `c2c(C)cc1nc(C)ccc1c2` → **-0.33111365**, but the presence of esters and nitro groups complicates the comparison.

4. **Aliphatic substitutions (`C(C)`):**  
   - Aliphatic groups (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)O`) often correlate with higher values (e.g., **1.21408337**), but here they are part of a more complex system.

### Observations:
- The nitro group on the aromatic ring likely reduces the property value (as seen in other examples).
- The two ester groups (`COC(=O)` and `C(=O)OC`) likely increase the value, but their effect may be offset by the nitro group.
- The molecule lacks strongly positive features (e.g., long aliphatic chains or multiple non-polar groups) that would push the value toward **1.21408337**.

### Closest Analogues:
- `CC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2)C` (hypothetical simplified version) might resemble `c2c(C)cc1nc(C)ccc1c2` (**-0.33111365**), but with esters and nitro.
- `CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O` → **-0.09339103** (similar complexity with polar/nitro-like features).

### Prediction:
Given the competing effects of the nitro group (reducing value) and esters (increasing value), the property value is likely slightly negative but not as extreme as **-0.67449076**. A reasonable estimate is between **-0.2 and 0.1**.

From the examples, the closest match in behavior is:
- `CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O` → **-0.09339103**
- `CC1=C(CCCO1)C(=O)Nc2ccccc2` → **-0.09339103**

Thus, the predicted property value for the given molecule is:  
**-0.09339103**

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.26979630379063807
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Negative Values (~ -0.674)**:
   - These are often associated with aromatic systems, especially those with halogens (Cl, Br, I) or heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, fused aromatic rings). Examples:
     - `Clc1cccc(I)c1` (-0.674)
     - `c1ccncc1` (-0.674)
     - `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (-0.674).

2. **Moderately Negative Values (~ -0.4 to -0.5)**:
   - These often involve aromatic systems with fewer halogens or polar groups (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1Cl` at -0.404, `OCc1ccccc1` at -0.404).

3. **Near-Zero or Slightly Negative Values (~ -0.1 to -0.3)**:
   - These involve polar or functionalized aromatics (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` at -0.254).

4. **Positive Values (~ 0.8 to 1.2)**:
   - These are typically aliphatic, non-aromatic molecules with flexible chains or rings (e.g., `CCCCCCCO` at 1.214, `C1CCCCC1` at 1.214).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2** is a cyclic imide with two carbonyl groups and a cyclopropane ring fused to the imide. Key features:
- **No aromaticity**: The structure is aliphatic (no conjugated rings).
- **Polar groups**: Two amide carbonyls (C=O) and a rigid cyclopropane ring.
- **No halogens or extended conjugation**.

Given the absence of aromaticity and halogens, and the presence of polar but non-aromatic functional groups, this molecule is unlikely to fall into the highly negative category. It resembles aliphatic polar molecules (e.g., `CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` at 0.870) or rigid polar systems (e.g., `CC(=O)SC4CC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C5CCC2(C)C(CCC23CCC(=O)O3)C45` at 0.820).

### Predicted Property Value:
The molecule is most similar to aliphatic polar systems with rigid rings, which tend to have **positive property values in the range of 0.8–1.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.870** (similar to other cyclic carbonyl-containing aliphatic molecules in the examples). 

This aligns with the absence of aromaticity/halogens and the presence of polar aliphatic features.

Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCC** (chloroethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Chlorinated Alkanes**:
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): 1.21408337  
   - **CCC(C)(C)CC** (branched alkane): 1.21408337  
   - **CCC1CCCCC1** (cyclohexane with propyl substituent): 1.21408337  
   These suggest that saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes) tend to have high property values (~1.214).

   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): -0.67449076  
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene): -0.67449076  
   Chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have very low property values (~-0.674).

2. **Chlorinated Non-Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **CCN(CC)C(=S)SCC(Cl)=C**: 0.50586807  
     This is a chlorinated thioamide with some complexity, and the value is intermediate.
   - **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl**: 0.58455866  
     This is a highly chlorinated polycyclic compound, yet the value is positive but not as high as alkanes.
   - **ClCC** is a simple chlorinated alkane (chloroethane), which is less complex than the above examples.

3. **Other Simple Chlorinated Alkanes**:
   - No direct examples of simple chlorinated alkanes like **ClCC** are provided, but we can infer from the following:
     - **CC#N** (acetonitrile): 0.2697963 (polar but not chlorinated).  
     - **C1CC=CC1** (cyclopentene): 0.45865372 (unsaturated but not chlorinated).  
     - **ClCC** is likely to have a lower value than pure alkanes but higher than chlorinated aromatics.

4. **Hybrid Cases**:
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC**: 1.21408337 (this is a thiophosphate, but the value matches alkanes, suggesting sulfur/phosphorus may not always lower the value).  
   - **CSc1nc(nc(n1)N(C)C)N(C)C**: 0.50586807 (sulfur-containing heterocycle).  

### Prediction for **ClCC**:
- **ClCC** is a simple chlorinated alkane. It is less polar than chlorinated aromatics but more polar than pure alkanes.  
- Given that **CC#N** (acetonitrile, a polar molecule) has a value of 0.2697963, and **C1CC=CC1** (cyclopentene) has 0.45865372, **ClCC** likely falls in a similar or slightly lower range due to the electronegativity of chlorine.  
- Since chlorinated aromatics are consistently ~-0.674, and alkanes are ~1.214, **ClCC** is expected to be in the middle but closer to the alkane range because it lacks aromaticity.  

### Estimated Value:
A reasonable estimate for **ClCC** is **~0.5**, similar to other moderately polar non-aromatic chlorinated compounds in the dataset (e.g., **CCN(CC)C(=S)SCC(Cl)=C** is 0.50586807).  

### Final Prediction:
**0.50586807** (matching the closest analogous example in the dataset).  

(Note: If the exact value is not critical, the range is likely between 0.4 and 0.6, but the dataset suggests **0.50586807** is a plausible match for this type of structure.)

True Property: -0.35972840505418413
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **High values (~1.214)** are associated with:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**, **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC**).
   - Halogenated alkanes (e.g., **ClCC(Cl)Cl**, **BrC(Cl)Cl**).
   - Polyols (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**).
   - Highly halogenated rigid structures (e.g., **ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)...**, a perchlorinated cage).

2. **Low values (~-0.674)** are associated with:
   - Aromatic systems (e.g., **Oc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2**, **c1ccc2c(c1)sc3ccccc23**).
   - Nitro groups on aromatics (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**).
   - Heteroaromatics (e.g., **c2ccc1ocnc1c2**).

3. **Intermediate values** (between -0.5 and 0.5) often involve:
   - Polar functional groups (e.g., amides, esters, nitro groups not on aromatics).
   - Mixed aliphatic-aromatic systems with polar substituents.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has:
- A **chlorinated pyridine ring** (aromatic heterocycle).
- A **CCl3 group** (strongly electron-withdrawing but not aliphatic).

From the examples:
- Aromatic systems with halogens (e.g., **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl**) have **-0.674**.
- Pyridine-like structures (e.g., **c2ccc1ocnc1c2**) also have **-0.674**.
- The **CCl3** group is similar to **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** in **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, which has **-0.404**, but the latter has two aromatic rings.

Given the dominance of the aromatic pyridine core and the lack of aliphatic flexibility, the property is likely **-0.67449076**, matching other aromatic/heteroaromatic systems.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.67449076**
==================================================
Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property value tends to cluster around certain values for molecules with similar structural features. Here are some key observations:

1. **Simple aliphatic chains with terminal hydroxyl groups (-OH)** often have a property value of **1.21408337**. Examples include:
   - CCCC(O)CCC → 1.21408337
   - CCC(C)CCO → 1.21408337
   - CCC(CC)CO → 1.21408337
   - ClCC → 1.21408337 (despite the Cl, the small aliphatic chain dominates)
   - CCCC1CCCC1 → 1.21408337 (aliphatic cyclic structure)

2. The molecule **CCCCC(C)O** is a branched aliphatic chain with a terminal hydroxyl group, structurally similar to the examples above (e.g., CCC(C)CCO, CCC(CC)CO).

3. Other functional groups or aromatic systems tend to lower the property value (e.g., aromatic rings, halogens, carbonyls, etc.), but this molecule lacks those features.

Given this pattern, the predicted property value for **CCCCC(C)O** is:

**1.21408337**
==================================================
Iteration: 67
SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **Highly positive values (~1.214)** are associated with:
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO`, `ClCCl`, `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C`).
   - Halogenated alkanes (e.g., `ClC(Cl)Cl`, `ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl`).
   - Phosphorothioates with long/aliphatic groups (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSP(=S)(OCC)OCC`).

2. **Highly negative values (~-0.674)** are associated with:
   - Aromatic systems, especially polycyclic (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1`, `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl`).
   - Conjugated systems with halogens (e.g., `Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1`).
   - Heterocycles with multiple electronegative atoms (e.g., `O=c2[nH]c(=O)c1[nH]c(=O)[nH]c1[nH]2`).

3. **Intermediate values** depend on:
   - Mixed aliphatic/aromatic systems (e.g., `CCCCCc1ccccc1` ~0.184).
   - Polar functional groups (e.g., `CCOC(=O)N` ~0.585).
   - Halogenated aromatics with additional features (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` ~-0.549).

### Prediction for `Brc1ccc(Br)cc1`:
- This is a **dibrominated benzene** (1,4-dibromobenzene), a simple halogenated aromatic system.
- Similar examples:
  - `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (1,4-dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **-0.67449076**.
  - `Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` (2,5-dichlorophenol) also has **-0.67449076**.
  - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl` (4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl) has **-0.67449076**.

The presence of **two halogens on an aromatic ring** consistently correlates with the property value **~-0.674**. The specific halogen (Br vs. Cl) does not appear to significantly alter the value in these examples.

### Predicted property value for `Brc1ccc(Br)cc1`:
**-0.67449076** (same as the dibromo/dichloro aromatic examples).

2. **Simple aliphatic halides** (e.g., `ClC(Br)Br`, `CCBr`, `CCCCCCCBr`) tend to have a property value of **1.21408337**.
3. **Aromatic systems with multiple halogens** (e.g., `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) consistently show **-0.67449076**.
4. **Other functional groups** (e.g., carbonyls, nitro groups, ethers) influence the property in different ways, but **chlorinated aromatics are very consistent**.

### Given Molecule:

This is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-like structure**, similar to the example:  
`Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (which has a value of **-0.67449076**).  

### Prediction:
Since the given molecule is **another heavily chlorinated aromatic system**, it is highly likely to have the same property value as the other examples of this class.

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: -0.40469445568595713
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular size, polarity, functional groups, and aromaticity. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Large, non-polar hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCC, CCCCCCCCC)** tend to have high property values (~1.214).
2. **Polar or functionalized molecules (e.g., alcohols, carbonyls, nitriles)** have intermediate values (0.5–0.8).
3. **Aromatic systems with electronegative substituents (e.g., Cl, NO₂, multiple rings)** tend to have negative values (e.g., -0.674 for Cl-heavy aromatics).
4. **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., P(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)...)** have intermediate values (~0.13–0.58).

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
- **Structure**: The molecule is a **triaryl phosphate** (P=O linked to three aromatic rings, two of which are methyl-substituted phenyl groups and one is a biphenyl-like system).
- **Features**:
  - **Aromaticity**: Multiple aromatic rings (high electron density).
  - **Polarity**: The P=O and P-O-aryl bonds introduce polarity.
  - **Bulky/steric**: Large, branched structure with no long aliphatic chains.
- **Comparable Examples**:
  - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property = 0.134) has a P=S group and aromaticity.
  - **COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (property = -0.202) has multiple aromatic rings and polar substituents.
  - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** (property = -0.674) is a polyhalogenated biphenyl.

### Prediction:
The given molecule is **bulky and aromatic with polar P=O bonds** but lacks strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl or NO₂). It is most similar to **phosphorus-containing aromatics** with intermediate polarity. Given the examples, its property value is likely in the **low positive range**.

**Predicted property value: 0.08**  
*(Close to values like 0.08093889 for C1CCc2ccccc2C1 or 0.134 for P-containing aromatics)*.

Iteration: 70
SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.11241512657943255
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on structural features.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly negative values (~ -0.674)**: Often associated with aromatic systems, especially those with nitro groups (N(=O)=O), fused aromatic rings, or electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, NO2) on aromatic rings. Examples:
   - `Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (fused aromatic): -0.674
   - `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (nitro + aromatic): -0.674
   - `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (halogenated aromatic): -0.674

2. **Moderately negative values (~ -0.404 to -0.464)**: Seen in molecules with nitro groups on substituted aromatics or moderately polar/electron-withdrawing groups. Examples:
   - `Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O`: -0.404 (two nitro groups)
   - `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2`: -0.404 (polyhalogenated)

3. **Near-zero or slightly positive values (~ 0.0 to 0.37)**: Associated with molecules containing polar but balanced functional groups (e.g., amides, sulfonamides, or mixed halogens). Examples:
   - `CC(C)(C)C(=O)C(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)n2cncn2`: 0.0 (amide + heterocycle)
   - `CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`: 0.080 (phosphorothioate + halogenated aromatic)

4. **High positive values (~ 1.214)**: Typically seen in aliphatic chains, alcohols, or simple non-aromatic structures. Examples:
   - `CC(C)CC(C)O`: 1.214 (aliphatic alcohol)
   - `CCCC`: 1.214 (pure hydrocarbon)

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**  
- Contains a **trifluoromethyl (CF3)** group (strongly electron-withdrawing).
- Aromatic ring with substitution (moderate polarity).
- **Lactam (cyclic amide)**: N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O (polar but not strongly negative).
- Two **chlorine atoms** (electron-withdrawing but not as extreme as nitro groups).

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C`: Contains CF3 and sulfonamide, property = 0.012 (near zero).
- `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2`: Polyhalogenated, property = -0.404.
- `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl`: Sulfonamide + nitro, property = -0.404.

The target molecule has a **CF3 group + aromatic + lactam + Cl substituents**, which suggests moderate polarity but not extreme electron-withdrawal like nitro groups. It is most similar to molecules with property values around **-0.404**.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.40469446**  
This aligns with the trend for moderately polar, halogenated, and non-nitro aromatic systems in the examples.
==================================================
Iteration: 71
SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.40469445568595713
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's break down the structural features and correlate them with the property values:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - Molecules with a nitro group tend to have **negative property values** (e.g., `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(N=CNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` = -0.674, `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` = -0.674).
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing and often correlates with lower property values.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Electron-Withdrawing Substituents**:
   - Aromatic rings with nitro or other electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `c1ccccc1O` = -0.674, `Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2` = -0.674) consistently show property values around **-0.674**.

3. **Methoxy Group (OCH3)**:
   - The methoxy group is weakly electron-donating, but its effect is often overshadowed by strong electron-withdrawing groups like nitro. For example, `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` = -0.297 (where carbonyl dominates over methoxy).

4. **Combination of Methoxy and Nitro on Aromatic Ring**:
   - The molecule `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has both a methoxy (electron-donating) and nitro (electron-withdrawing) group on the same aromatic ring. The nitro group's effect is stronger, so the property value should align with other nitro-aromatics.

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong influence of the nitro group and the aromatic ring, the property value for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is expected to be **-0.67449076**, matching other nitro-aromatic examples.

### Final Answer:
**-0.67449076**
==================================================
Iteration: 72
SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.8363685417509781
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure. Here are some key observations:

1. **Highly negative values (-0.67449076)** are associated with:
   - Molecules containing nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`), e.g., `O=N(=O)c1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`.
   - Molecules with multiple halogens (Cl, Br) on aromatic rings, e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl`, `Clc1ccccc1`.
   - Molecules with highly conjugated or aromatic systems with electronegative substituents.

2. **Positive values (1.21408337)** are associated with:
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCOC`, `ClCCCl`, `CCCCl`).
   - Molecules with no strongly electronegative or conjugated systems.

3. **Intermediate values** (e.g., ~0.2697963, -0.04496605) are associated with:
   - Molecules with moderate polarity or small electronegative groups (e.g., `ClCC#N`, `CC#N`).
   - Some sterically hindered or branched aliphatics.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule in question is:
`ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl`

This is a **highly chlorinated polycyclic alkane** (likely a chlorinated cage-like structure, e.g., a derivative of hexachloronorbornane or similar). Key features:
- No aromaticity or conjugation.
- No nitro or other highly electronegative groups besides Cl.
- Multiple Cl substituents, but these are on aliphatic carbons (not aromatic).
- Structurally similar to `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (perchlorocyclohexane), which has a value of **1.21408337**.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (fully chlorinated aliphatic ring, value = 1.21408337), the target molecule is also expected to have a **property value of 1.21408337**. The presence of multiple Cl atoms on an aliphatic framework does not significantly perturb the property in this context, as seen in the examples.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 1.21408337**
==================================================
Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.7419398354242547
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Cycloalkanes** (e.g., C1CCCCCC1, CC(Cl)Cl, CCCI, CCCC(O)CC, OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO):
   - These tend to have the highest property value of **1.21408337**, especially if they are saturated (no double/triple bonds) and lack polar or aromatic groups.

2. **Aromatic or Conjugated Systems** (e.g., c1ccc2c(c1)sc3ccccc23, Clc1ccccc1I, NC(=O)c1ccccc1):
   - These often have the lowest property value of **-0.67449076**, especially if they contain aromatic rings or conjugated systems with electronegative atoms (e.g., N, O, halogens).

3. **Polar or Functionalized Aliphatic Compounds**:
   - Compounds with polar groups (e.g., CO, OH, Br, Cl, NO2) but no aromaticity tend to have intermediate values. For example:
     - **CC(O)c1ccccc1**: -0.20234723 (aliphatic OH + aromatic)
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: -0.25480762 (ester + aromatic amine)
     - **CC#N**: 0.2697963 (nitrile group, aliphatic)
     - **CCC#C**: 0.2697963 (terminal alkyne)

4. **Esters and Carbonyl-Containing Compounds**:
   - Esters (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1) tend to have negative or slightly negative values (-0.25480762 in this case).
   - Aliphatic aldehydes/ketones (not in examples, but similar to esters) would likely follow this trend.

### Analysis of CCCOC=O:
- **Structure**: Propyl formate (CH3CH2CH2OC=O), an aliphatic ester.
- **Key Features**:
  - No aromaticity or conjugation (except the C=O bond).
  - Contains a polar ester group (C=O and O linkage).
  - Similar to **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (property = -0.25480762), but without the aromatic ring and amine group. The absence of the aromatic system (which strongly lowers the value) suggests the property should be less negative.
  - Comparable to **CC#N** (0.2697963) or **CCC#C** (0.2697963) in being a polar aliphatic compound, but esters are more polar than nitriles or alkynes, so the value might be slightly lower.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, **CCCOC=O** is likely to have a property value in the range of **0.1 to 0.3**, similar to other polar aliphatic compounds without aromaticity. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.18395203**  
(This matches the value seen for other aliphatic polar compounds like CCN(CC)c1c(cc(c(N)c1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O and CCCCCc1ccccc1 in the examples.)
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 1.0567021898466658
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe some trends in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Long aliphatic chains (especially with terminal polar groups) tend to have positive values:
   - CCCCCCc1ccccc1 → 0.2697963
   - CCC1CCCCC1 → 1.21408337
   - CC → 1.21408337

2. The presence of ester groups (like -COO-) often gives moderately positive values:
   - COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C → 0.20684383

3. The molecule in question is CCCC(=O)OCC (likely a typo and should be CCCC(=O)OCC, an ester with a medium-length aliphatic chain).

Given that:
- Pure alkanes like CC and CCC1CCCCC1 give 1.21408337
- An ester with some complexity gives 0.20684383
- A simple aromatic ester (CCOc1ccccc1) gives -0.20234723

This molecule has:
- A long aliphatic chain (CCCC)
- An ester group (=O)OCC

Given the strong positive contribution from the aliphatic chain and moderate contribution from the ester, I would predict a value between the pure alkane (1.214) and the complex ester (0.206), likely closer to the pure alkane because of the longer chain.

Comparing with CCCCCCc1ccccc1 (0.2697963) which has a 6-carbon chain + phenyl, this molecule has a 4-carbon chain + ester, so likely higher than 0.269 but less than 1.214.

A reasonable prediction would be: 0.83636854 (same as CCNC(=S)NCC which also has a chain + polar group)

Final predicted value: 0.83636854

Iteration: 75
SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic rings with polar substituents**: The molecule contains two benzene rings with multiple polar substituents (OH, Cl, C=O, NO2). 
   - Similar examples:
     - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2**: Property = -0.42268088 (amide linker, chloro and ether substituents).
     - **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**: Property = -0.67449076 (multiple chloro and hydroxy groups).
     - **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: Property = -0.67449076 (chloro and nitro groups).

2. **Nitro group (NO2)**: The presence of a nitro group is associated with negative property values in the examples (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** = -0.67449076).

3. **Amide linker (C(=O)N)**: Amides in the examples tend to reduce the property value (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** = -0.42268088).

4. **Hydroxy group (OH)**: This is also associated with negative values (e.g., **Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1** = -0.67449076).

### Comparison:
The molecule combines:
- A hydroxy group (OH),
- Chloro substituents (Cl),
- A nitro group (NO2),
- An amide linker (C(=O)N).

These features are all associated with negative property values in the examples. The closest analogs are:
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (-0.42268088): Similar amide and chloro/ether substituents.
- **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (-0.67449076): Nitro and chloro substituents.

Given the additional nitro group and amide linker, the property value is likely more negative than -0.42268088 but not as extreme as -0.67449076 (since the molecule is more complex than the simple nitro-chloro analog).

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate is **-0.45**, interpolating between the closest examples. 

However, looking at the trend:
- The nitro group alone gives -0.67449076.
- The amide linker with chloro/ether gives -0.42268088.
- Combining these features suggests a value between these two.

Thus, the predicted property is:  
**-0.45** (approximate; exact value would require fitting a model, but this is a plausible estimate based on the examples). 

For consistency with the given examples, I would round to **-0.42268088** (similar to the amide-chloro-ether case), but the nitro group likely pushes it slightly more negative. A refined guess is **-0.47**. 

Given the data, the most justifiable answer is:  
**-0.42268088** (same as the closest analog with amide + chloro + ether). 

However, acknowledging the nitro group's effect, a more accurate prediction might be **-0.50**. 

Final answer: **-0.50**.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: -0.20234722784297857
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe the following patterns in the property values:

1. Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCC, CCCC(C)O, CCCO) consistently have a property value of 1.21408337
2. Aromatic rings without polar substituents (e.g., c1ccccc1, C=Cc1ccccc1) consistently have -0.67449076
3. Molecules with multiple chlorine substitutions on aromatic rings tend to have -0.67449076
4. Molecules with both aliphatic and aromatic character tend to have intermediate values
5. Phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)) appear in two examples with value 0.19715884

The target molecule: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1

Key features:
- Contains two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC))
- Has aromatic rings
- Has thioether linkage (S)
- No long aliphatic chains

Most similar examples:
1. CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1 (0.19715884) - contains phosphorothioate-like group and aromatic
2. COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 (0.19715884) - contains same P(=S)(OC) group

Given that our target has two P(=S)(OC) groups but more aromatic character than these examples, I would predict a value slightly lower than 0.19715884 but still in this general range.

Predicted property value: 0.16487552

This matches well with the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC=C which has mixed character and a value of 0.16487552.

Based on the provided examples, the property value for molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) and aromatic rings tends to be around **-0.67449076** (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Br)c1`, `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2`, `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O`, `c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24`, `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl`, `Sc2nc1ccccc1s2`, `C=CC=C`, `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`, `Nc1cccc(Cl)c1`, `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2`).  

The molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (a nitrophenol derivative) fits this pattern, as it contains both an aromatic ring and a nitro group.

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule:

**OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O**

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Hydrophilic/Sugar-like Molecules**: 
   - Molecules with many hydroxyl groups (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`) tend to have a property value of **1.21408337**. This suggests that high oxygen content and multiple -OH groups correlate with this high value.
   - The given molecule is a complex sugar (likely a oligosaccharide or polysaccharide derivative) with many -OH groups and ether linkages, similar to `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` but larger.

2. **Large Hydrophobic/Aliphatic Chains**:
   - Long aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` or `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`) also have a value of **1.21408337**. This suggests that size and hydrophobicity can also lead to this value, but the given molecule is not hydrophobic.

3. **Other Cases**:
   - Aromatic or halogenated molecules tend to have negative values (e.g., `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` has -0.67449076).
   - Moderately polar or small molecules have intermediate values (e.g., `CCC#N` has 0.58455866).

### Prediction:
The given molecule is a **highly oxygenated sugar with multiple hydroxyl groups**, structurally similar to `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` but more complex. Given that even simpler polyhydroxy molecules like `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` have a value of **1.21408337**, it is reasonable to predict that this larger sugar molecule would also have the same property value.

### Final Answer:
**1.21408337**
==================================================
Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.26979630379063807
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular features:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons with no polar functional groups** (e.g., alkanes, alkenes, or simple aromatic rings without substituents) tend to have **positive property values** when they are **long or bulky** (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO` = 1.21408337, `CCCC(=O)C` = 0.83636854, `CCCCCCCCC=C` = 0.83636854).  
   - Shorter or less bulky hydrocarbons (e.g., `Cc1cc(C)c(C)c1`) have **smaller positive or slightly negative values**.

2. **Polar or electronegative functional groups** (e.g., nitro, cyano, halogens, carbonyl, etc.) tend to **decrease the property value**, often to **-0.67449076** (a common negative value in the dataset).  
   - Examples: `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` = -0.67449076, `Fc1cccc(F)c1` = -0.67449076, `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` = -0.67449076.

3. **Alkynes** are somewhat intermediate in polarity due to the triple bond's electronegativity but are less polar than nitriles or nitro groups.  
   - The molecule `CCC#C` is a short alkyne with no other functional groups.

### Prediction for **CCC#C**:
- The triple bond introduces some polarity, but the molecule is small and lacks strongly electronegative substituents (like halogens or nitro groups).  
- Comparing to similar molecules:  
  - `Cc1cncc(C)c1` (methyl-substituted pyridine-like structure) = -0.13489815.  
  - `CC#N` (not in the dataset, but nitriles are more polar than alkynes) would likely be closer to -0.67449076.  
  - `CCCC(=O)C` (ketone) = 0.83636854, but carbonyls are more polar than alkynes.  

Given this, **CCC#C** is expected to have a **slightly negative or near-zero property value**, but not as extreme as -0.67449076. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.13** (similar to `Cc1cncc(C)c1`).  

However, since the dataset shows that even small non-polar or weakly polar molecules can have values around **-0.04 to -0.13**, and alkynes are more polar than pure alkanes but less than nitriles, the value is likely in this range.  

### Final Answer:  
**Predicted property value for CCC#C: -0.13** (approximate, based on trends).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The value could also be closer to **-0.09** if the alkyne's effect is milder.)  

---  
**Clarification**: If the property is something like **logP (partition coefficient)**, the trend would make sense (alkynes are slightly more polar than alkanes but less than alcohols/nitriles). If it's another property, the reasoning may differ. Based on the examples, **-0.13** is a plausible estimate.

Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 0.08093889113719145
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question, I'll attempt to predict the property based on observed patterns:

Key observations from the examples:
1. Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCCCC, CCCCOCCCC) tend to have high values (~1.214)
2. Aromatic rings with multiple chlorine substitutions consistently show values around -0.674
3. Phosphorothioate groups (P=S) appear in molecules with mid-range positive values (0.197 to 0.836)
4. The presence of both aromatic chlorines and P=S groups appears to balance out to intermediate values

The target molecule: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
- Contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S) like some mid-range positive examples
- Has a tri-chlorinated phenyl ring like the consistent -0.674 examples
- The combination suggests partial cancellation of these opposing influences

Looking at most similar examples:
- COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 → 0.197 (P=S + single Cl-phenyl)
- Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 → -0.674 (diCl-phenyl + other groups)

Given that our molecule has stronger chlorination (3 Cl) but also the P=S group with ethyl groups (which are somewhat stabilizing), I'd predict a value slightly lower than the 0.197 example but not as extreme as the -0.674 cases.

Predicted property value: -0.134 (approximately midway between the P=S-containing examples and the heavily chlorinated examples) 

However, noting that the P=S with three chlorines might be closer to the 0.197 example than the pure chlorinated cases, I'll refine to: 0.080 (matching the CC(C)(C)c1ccc(O)cc1 example which also has balancing features)

Final predicted value: 0.08093889

Iteration: 81
SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains (e.g., `CC(C)C`, `CCCCBr`, `CCCCCCC`)**: These tend to have high positive values (e.g., `1.21408337`). The property seems to favor non-polar, aliphatic structures.
2. **Aromatic Rings (e.g., `c1ccccc1`, `Nc1ccccc1Cl`, `Clc1ccccc1Cl`)**: These often have the value `-0.67449076`, especially if they are unsubstituted or have simple substituents (e.g., halogens, amino groups).
3. **Polar or Functionalized Aromatics (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`, `COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1`)**: These can deviate from `-0.67449076` depending on the functional groups. For example:
   - Amides or polar groups (e.g., `C(=O)N`) may reduce the magnitude of the negative value (e.g., `-0.25480762`).
   - Multiple polar substituents or heterocycles (e.g., `COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1`) can even lead to positive values (`0.64751113`).
4. **Conjugated Systems or Complex Aromatics (e.g., `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23`)**: These often default to `-0.67449076` unless heavily functionalized.
5. **Hybrid Structures (e.g., `CC(=O)CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O`)**: These can have intermediate values (e.g., `-0.37629484`) due to mixed aliphatic/aromatic and polar/non-polar character.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1` is a pyridine ring (heteroaromatic) with a substituent `C(=O)NN` (a hydrazide group). Key features:
- The pyridine ring is aromatic and similar to other heteroaromatics (e.g., `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23`), which often have `-0.67449076`.
- The `C(=O)NN` group is polar and may reduce the magnitude of the negative value, similar to how amides (`C(=O)N`) do in other examples.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (aromatic with amino group): `-0.67449076`.
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (aromatic with amide): `-0.25480762`.
- `COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1` (polar heterocycle): `0.64751113`.

The hydrazide group (`C(=O)NN`) is more polar than a simple amide but less polar than the heavily substituted `COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1`. Thus, the value is likely between `-0.67449076` and `-0.25480762`.

### Prediction:
Given the polarity of the hydrazide group and the aromatic pyridine ring, the property value is likely closer to `-0.25480762` but still negative. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.40469446**  
(This matches other intermediate cases like `CCN2c1cc(Cl)ccc1NC(=O)c3cccnc23` with `-0.40469446`).

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 1.0791852151625523
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **High Property Values (~1.214)**:
   - Molecules with simple aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCI**, **BrCBr**, **CCS**, **OC1C(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**) or cyclic alkanes (e.g., **C/C1CCC(\C)CC1**) tend to have high values (~1.214).
   - Presence of halogens (Br, I) or hydroxyl groups (OH) in simple structures also correlates with high values.

2. **Intermediate Property Values (~0.5–0.9)**:
   - Molecules with amides, esters, or complex aliphatic/cyclic structures (e.g., **CC12CC(=O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO**) have intermediate values (~0.58–0.85).
   - Presence of **P(=S)** (thiophosphate) in **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** gives a low value (-0.045), but this may be due to the nitro group's influence.

3. **Low/Negative Property Values (~-0.2 to -0.7)**:
   - Aromatic rings, especially with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., **NO2**, **Cl**), or fused aromatic systems (e.g., **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1**) tend to have negative values (~-0.67).
   - Conjugated systems or polar groups (e.g., **C=CC#N**, **Oc1ccncc1**) also correlate with negative values.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C** has:
- **Aliphatic chains (CCCO, OCCC, CCCCC)** → Suggests a higher property value.
- **Thiophosphate group (P(=S))** → Neutral/moderate influence (unless combined with other features).
- **Amide group (C(=O)N)** → Typically intermediate influence (~0.58–0.84).
- No aromatic rings or strong electron-withdrawing groups → No strong negative contribution.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **CCOC(=O)N** (ethyl carbamate) has a value of **0.58455866**.
- **CC12CC(=O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO** (complex aliphatic/cyclic with amide) has **0.76442286**.
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** (thiophosphate + nitro) has **-0.04496605**, but the nitro group likely dominates the negative value.

Given the aliphatic chains and amide group, the property value should be **intermediate-positive**. The thiophosphate group may slightly reduce it, but not drastically. 

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.58455866** (similar to **CCOC(=O)N**, adjusted for the larger aliphatic/amide structure). 

Thus, the predicted value is:  
**0.58455866**

   - CC(C)(C)CO (1.21408337)
   - OCC(O)C(O)CO (1.21408337)
   - CCCCC(C)(C)CO (1.21408337)
   - CCCCC1CCCC1 (1.21408337)

   These molecules are either linear or branched alkanes, alcohols, or simple cyclic alkanes with no aromaticity or electronegative substituents.

2. **Aromatic systems (especially with halogens or nitro groups)** tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**. Examples include:
   - c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45 (-0.67449076)
   - Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 (-0.67449076)
   - Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (-0.67449076)
   - c1ccsc1 (-0.67449076)
   - Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl (-0.67449076)

   - Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (-0.67449076)
   - Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F (-0.67449076)
   - Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.67449076)
   - Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O (-0.67449076)
   - Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (-0.67449076)

3. **Other structures** (e.g., complex functional groups, mixed aliphatic/aromatic systems, or specific heterocycles) have intermediate values that vary.

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCC**:
The molecule **CCCCCCCC** (octane) is a simple linear alkane with no functional groups, no aromaticity, and no halogens. Based on the consistent trend observed for such aliphatic hydrocarbons in the examples, its predicted property value is:

**Predicted property value: 1.21408337**
==================================================
Iteration: 84
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 0.7419398354242547
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain values, with **1.21408337** being a common value for relatively simple or saturated hydrocarbons (e.g., cycloalkanes like `C1CCCCCCC1`, ethers like `CCCOCCC`, and alcohols like `OCC2OC(OC1(CO)OC(CO)C(O)C1O)C(O)C(O)C2O`). 

On the other hand, molecules with **complex ring systems, carbonyl groups, or conjugated systems** tend to have lower values, often in the range of **0.5–0.9** (e.g., steroids like `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` with **0.91588745**). 

The molecule in question:  
**`CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C`**  

- It has a **steroid-like fused ring system** (similar to some examples with values around **0.7–0.9**).  
- It contains **a carbonyl group (`C=O`)** and **an alkyne (`C#C`)**.  
- It also has **hydroxyl groups (`O`)** which can influence the property.  

Given these structural features, it most closely resembles molecules like:  
- `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` (**0.91588745**)  
- `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` (**0.85435496**)  

Thus, I predict the property for this molecule to be in the **0.85–0.92 range**.  

**Final predicted value: 0.89** (rounded estimate based on structural similarity).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—possibly logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)*

True Property: 0.3674811724044898
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to cluster around certain key values, particularly **-0.67449076**, **-0.40469446**, **1.21408337**, and intermediate values like **0.2697963** or **-0.53959261**. The property appears to be influenced by molecular features such as:

1. **Aromaticity and halogenation**: Many aromatic or halogenated compounds (e.g., `c1ccccc1`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`) have the value **-0.67449076**.
2. **Polar functional groups**: Molecules with hydroxyl, carbonyl, or nitro groups often have values around **-0.67449076** or **-0.40469446**.
3. **Aliphatic chains and flexibility**: Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCOCCO`, `CCCCCC(C)O`) tend to have the value **1.21408337**.
4. **Complexity and mixed features**: Molecules with both aromatic and aliphatic components (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1N`) have intermediate values like **-0.40469446**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The given molecule is highly complex with multiple fused rings, ether linkages (`OC`), hydroxyl groups (`O`), and aliphatic components (`CO`, `C6C2C`). Structurally, it resembles a glycoside or a polycyclic natural product with significant polarity and rigidity.

Key observations:
- It lacks long aliphatic chains (which would push the value toward **1.21408337**).
- It has aromaticity (e.g., `c7cc5OCOc5cc67`) and polar groups (e.g., `OC`, `O`), similar to molecules with values around **-0.67449076** or **-0.40469446**.
- The presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, hydroxyls) suggests moderate polarity, but the fused-ring system may reduce flexibility, aligning more with **-0.40469446** than **-0.67449076**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to polar, polycyclic molecules in the examples (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1N` or `OCc1ccccc1`), the predicted property value is:

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.6744907594765952

Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structures:

1. **Aromatic rings with halogen substitutions (Cl, Br, I) or nitro groups (NO2)** tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**. Examples:
   - `Clc1ccccc1I` (-0.67449076)
   - `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (-0.67449076)
   - `Fc1ccccc1` (-0.67449076)
   - `Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl` (-0.67449076)

2. **Phenol derivatives (aromatic rings with -OH substituents)** also frequently exhibit this value when combined with halogens or nitro groups:
   - `Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (-0.67449076)
   - `Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I` (-0.67449076)

3. The molecule in question, `Oc1ccccc1Cl`, is a **chlorophenol** (phenol with a chlorine substituent), which fits the pattern of aromatic rings with -OH and halogen substitutions.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the consistent property value for similar structures, the predicted property for `Oc1ccccc1Cl` is:

**-0.67449076**
==================================================
Iteration: 87
SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -0.3311136455612377
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - **Chlorine atoms (Cl)**: Present at the alkyne terminal (ClCC#C) and on the benzene ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1). From the examples, Cl-substituted aromatic rings (e.g., Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)..., Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1) often correlate with property values around **-0.674** (indicating a negative contribution).
   - **Alkyne (C#C)**: Rare in the examples, but similar to double bonds or extended conjugation, which may slightly increase the property value.
   - **Ester-like linkage (OC(=O)N)**: Amide/ester groups (e.g., COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC) tend to have values around **-0.3 to -0.4**.
   - **Polar chain (CCOC(=O)N)**: Flexible polar chains (e.g., CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1) have values around **-0.1**.

2. **Aromatic System**:
   - The substituted benzene ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1) is similar to other Cl-substituted aromatics, which strongly favor values near **-0.674**.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The alkyne and polar chain might slightly offset the strongly negative contribution of the Cl-substituted aromatic, but the dominant feature is the aromatic Cl substitution.

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: Highly chlorinated, value = **-0.674**.
- **CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1**: Less chlorinated, polar chain, value = **-0.108**.
- **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1**: Moderately chlorinated, value = **-0.674**.

Given the strong influence of the Cl-substituted aromatic ring, the property value is likely close to **-0.674**, but the polar/alkyne chain may moderate this slightly. A reasonable prediction is between **-0.5 and -0.7**.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.55** (a compromise between the strongly negative aromatic Cl effect and the moderating polar/alkyne chain). 

However, given the consistency of Cl-substituted aromatics in the examples, the value is more likely **-0.674** (same as other similar cases). 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**-0.67449076** (matching the trend for Cl-substituted aromatics).

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains three aromatic rings (two benzene rings and one pyridine-like ring, `c2cncnc2`). Aromatic rings are common in many of the examples, and their presence often correlates with negative property values (e.g., `-0.67449076` for many simple aromatic systems like `N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` or `O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12`).
   
2. **Chlorine Substituents**: There are two chlorine atoms attached to the aromatic rings. Chlorinated aromatics in the examples (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`, `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`) tend to have property values around `-0.67449076` or slightly less negative (e.g., `-0.40469446` for more heavily substituted cases).

3. **Hydroxy Group (OH)**: The presence of an OH group attached to a central carbon (tertiary alcohol) is somewhat unique in this dataset. Alcohols are not heavily represented, but in cases like `Oc1ccc(O)cc1`, the value is `-0.67449076`. However, the OH here is part of a more complex scaffold.

4. **Heterocycle (c2cncnc2)**: The pyridine-like ring (`c2cncnc2`) is electron-deficient and may contribute to a more negative property value, similar to other nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., `Nc1nc[nH]n1` has `-0.67449076`).

5. **Steric Complexity**: The molecule is relatively bulky with three aromatic systems and substituents, which might slightly reduce the magnitude of the negative value compared to simpler chlorinated aromatics (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` is `-0.67449076`, while `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` is `-0.40469446`).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analogs are chlorinated aromatics with additional complexity. For example:
  - `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` has a value of `-0.40469446`.
  - `ClC(Cl)=C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` has `-0.67449076`.
  - The presence of the OH and the heterocycle here may push the value toward the middle of this range.

### Predicted Value:
Given the structural features and trends in the examples, a reasonable prediction for **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** is:

**-0.54858582**

This aligns with values observed for similarly complex chlorinated aromatics (e.g., `Cc1cccc2c(C)cccc12` has `-0.35972841`, and `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` has `-0.54858582`). The heterocycle and OH group likely contribute to a moderately negative value in this range.

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 0.8363685417509781
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property of **CCCCOC=O**:

1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - Molecules with **aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCCBr, CCCCCCCCC(=O)C, C1CCCCCCC1)** tend to have **higher property values (often 1.21408337)** unless other polar or aromatic groups reduce the value.
   - The presence of **carbonyl groups (C=O)** in aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCC(=O)OCC, CCCCCC=O**) gives a property value of **0.89932101**.
   - The molecule **CCCCOC=O** is structurally similar to **CCCC(=O)OCC** (butyl acetate) and **CCCCC=O** (hexanal), both of which have a property value of **0.89932101**. 

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The **ester (CCCC(=O)OCC)** and **aldehyde (CCCCC=O)** forms with a 5-6 carbon backbone yield **0.89932101**.
   - **CCCCOC=O** is a butyl formate (4-carbon chain + formyl group), which is structurally analogous to the examples above.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since **CCCCOC=O** fits the trend of aliphatic carbonyl-containing compounds with moderate chain length, its predicted property value is:

### **Predicted Property Value: 0.89932101**
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe a pattern in the property values based on the molecular structures:

1. **Simple alkanes and alkyl halides** (e.g., `CCCC`, `CCBr`, `ClCCCl`, `CCCCCCCCBr`) tend to have a property value of **1.21408337**. These are small, non-polar, or halogen-substituted aliphatic chains.

2. **Molecules with two or more chlorine atoms attached to an aromatic ring or aliphatic chain** (e.g., `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`, `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1`) tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**. These are highly chlorinated structures.

3. **Dichloromethane (`ClCCl`)** is a simple aliphatic dihalide, similar to `ClCCCl` (1,2-dichloroethane), which has a property value of **1.21408337**. 

Given that `ClCCl` (dichloromethane) is structurally analogous to `ClCCCl` (1,2-dichloroethane) and other small alkyl halides in the dataset, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will follow the same trend as other small halogenated alkanes.

### Predicted property value for `ClCCl`: **1.21408337**
==================================================
Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.20234722784297857
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Hydroxyl (-OH) Groups**:
   - Molecules like `Oc1cccc(O)c1`, `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`, and `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` have hydroxyl groups attached to aromatic rings. Their property values are:
     - `Oc1cccc(O)c1`: **-0.67449076**
     - `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`: **-0.67449076**
     - `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O`: **0.08093889** (this has an additional alkyl substitution, which seems to increase the value).

2. **Alkyl-Substituted Aromatic Rings**:
   - The presence of alkyl groups (e.g., methyl, ethyl) tends to increase the property value compared to unsubstituted or polar-substituted aromatics. For example:
     - `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O`: **0.08093889** (methyl and hydroxyl substitutions).
     - `c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32`: **-0.67449076** (no alkyl groups).

3. **Specific Case of `Cc1cccc(C)c1O`**:
   - This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol (toluene derivative with a hydroxyl group at the 1-position and a methyl group at the 2-position). It is structurally similar to `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` but with fewer alkyl substitutions.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Phenol-like structures (`Oc1ccccc1`) tend to have values around **-0.67449076**.
- Adding alkyl groups (e.g., methyl) increases the value (e.g., `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` has **0.08093889**).
- `Cc1cccc(C)c1O` has two methyl groups (one on the ring and one as a substituent), but not as heavily alkylated as `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O`.

Thus, the property value for `Cc1cccc(C)c1O` is likely **between -0.67449076 and 0.08093889**. A reasonable estimate is closer to the lower end because it is not as heavily alkylated as `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O`. 

However, looking at `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (value: **0.08093889**), which has two methyl groups and a hydroxyl, and comparing it to `Cc1cccc(C)c1O` (one methyl on the ring and one as a substituent), the value might be slightly lower but still positive due to the alkyl substitutions.

Given the examples, the most plausible prediction is:  
**0.08093889** (same as `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O`, as the substitution pattern is similar).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for `Cc1cccc(C)c1O` is **0.08093889**.

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I notice a pattern where molecules with multiple aromatic rings and heavy halogen (especially chlorine) substitutions tend to have a property value of **-0.67449076**. This value appears consistently for:

1. **Polychlorinated aromatic systems** (e.g., `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl`).  
2. **Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24`).  
3. **Nitro-substituted aromatics with halogens** (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`).  

The molecule in question, **`Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`**, fits this pattern perfectly:
- It is a **biphenyl system** (two aromatic rings).  
- It has **multiple chlorine substitutions** (5 chlorines total).  
- Structurally, it resembles other examples with the property value **-0.67449076**.  

Thus, the predicted property value for this molecule is:  
**-0.67449076**
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.4586537164440847
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Alkenes**:
   - **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (7-carbon chain with a terminal aldehyde and branching): **0.9780116**
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (9-carbon chain with a terminal alkene): **0.83636854**
   - **CCCCCCCC** (8-carbon saturated chain): **1.21408337**
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched saturated hydrocarbon): **1.21408337**
   - **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (steroid-like structure with ketone and alkene): **0.85435496**

   Saturated hydrocarbons and longer/branched chains tend to have higher property values (often >0.8), while alkenes or shorter chains reduce the value slightly.

2. **Alkenes and Branching**:
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a 5-carbon branched alkene (isoprene). Similar examples:
     - **CC(=O)C3(C)CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (steroid with alkene): **0.72141186**
     - **CC(=O)C=C** (small unsaturated ketone): **-0.20234723**
     - **CCCOC(=O)CCC** (ester with a 6-carbon chain): **0.94428706**

   The presence of a double bond (alkene) tends to lower the property value compared to saturated analogs, but branching can offset this slightly.

3. **Small Alkenes**:
   - **COC(=O)C=C** (small unsaturated ester): **-0.20234723**
   - **CC(=O)C=C** (small unsaturated ketone): **-0.20234723**
   - **CC=C(C)C** is similar in size but lacks polar groups (like C=O), which may increase the value slightly compared to these examples.

### Prediction for **CC=C(C)C**:
- It is a small branched alkene (5 carbons), similar in size to **COC(=O)C=C** but without the polar ester group. The lack of polar groups and the presence of branching/alkene suggest a value higher than **-0.20234723** but lower than saturated/branched hydrocarbons like **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (**1.21408337**).
- A reasonable estimate would be close to **0.5**, as it is more hydrophobic than small polar alkenes but less than long/branched saturated chains.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**0.5** (approximate, likely between 0.4 and 0.6 based on trends). 

For precision, I would predict **0.5** as a balanced estimate given the data.
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds** (e.g., `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`, `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl`) consistently have a property value of **-0.67449076**. These molecules contain multiple chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings or alkenes.

2. **Simple aliphatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., `CCCC1CCCC1`, `CCCC(C)(C)CO`, `CC(C)C(C)O`) consistently have a property value of **1.21408337**. These are typically saturated, non-polar molecules.

3. **Molecules with a single chlorine atom** or limited halogenation (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`, `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1`) tend to have intermediate values between -0.67449076 and 1.21408337, depending on other functional groups.

### Prediction for `ClCCl` (dichloromethane):
- This is a **small aliphatic molecule with two chlorine atoms**, but it lacks the extensive chlorination or aromaticity seen in the examples with -0.67449076. 
- It is more similar to simple aliphatic structures (which have high values) but with moderate polarity due to the chlorines. 
- The closest analog in the given examples is `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene, -0.67449076), but `ClCCl` has fewer chlorines and no double bond.

Given the lack of exact matches, the property value is likely **intermediate**. However, since the examples show that even small chlorinated aliphatics (like `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl`) default to -0.67449076, and no small chlorinated alkanes have higher values, the safest prediction is:

**Predicted property value for ClCCl: -0.67449076**  
*(This aligns with the trend that small chlorinated molecules, even non-aromatic ones, tend toward this value in the given data.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular features. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** `Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl`  
This is a chlorinated phenol derivative with three chlorine atoms and one hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, similar chlorinated aromatic compounds have the following property values:
- `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` (pentachlorophenol derivative): **-0.67449076**
- `Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1` (tribromobenzene): **-0.67449076**
- `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2` (biphenyl): **-0.67449076**
- `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2` (benzotriazole): **-0.67449076**

These molecules share common features:
1. Highly halogenated (Cl or Br) aromatic rings.
2. Lack of strongly electron-donating or polar groups (except for the hydroxyl in some cases).
3. The presence of multiple halogens or fused aromatic rings tends to drive the property toward **-0.67449076**.

The given molecule (`Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl`) is structurally similar to `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` (from the examples), differing only in the position of one chlorine. Since the examples show that such chlorinated aromatics consistently have the value **-0.67449076**, we can confidently predict the same for this molecule.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.3674811724044898
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I will analyze the given molecule and predict its property value based on observed patterns in the dataset.

### Observations from the dataset:
1. **High values (~1.214)** are associated with:
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCl`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`, `CC1CCCC1`).
   - Alcohols or polyols (e.g., `OCC(O)CO`, `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O`).
   - Halogenated aliphatics (e.g., `CCC(C)CBr`, `ClCC`).

2. **Intermediate values (~0.2 to ~0.9)** are associated with:
   - Complex cyclic or polycyclic structures with oxygenated functional groups (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO`, `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3`).
   - Sugars or glycosides (e.g., `CCOC2Oc1ccc(OS(C)(=O)=O)cc1C2(C)C`).

3. **Low values (~-0.674)** are associated with:
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`, `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N`).
   - Conjugated systems or planar heterocycles (e.g., `c2ccc1nc(ccc1c2)c4ccc3ccccc3n4`).

### Analysis of the given molecule:
`COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67`

This molecule is highly complex and contains:
- Multiple aromatic rings with methoxy (`OCH3`) and hydroxyl (`OH`) substituents.
- A polycyclic sugar-like core with multiple oxygenated functional groups (e.g., `COC2=O`, `C(O)C4O`).
- A dioxolane-like fragment (`OCOc5cc67`).

Given the presence of oxygenated cyclic structures and the absence of strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like `NO2`, `C#N`, or halogens on aromatics), this molecule is most similar to the **intermediate-value category** (e.g., sugars or polycyclic oxygenated systems). 

### Predicted property value:
Based on the examples, the most likely value is **~0.854** (similar to `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` or `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO`). 

However, the presence of additional aromatic methoxy groups might slightly reduce the value compared to purely aliphatic polycyclic cases. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.63298364**  
(Similar to `O=c2[nH]c1CCCc1c(=O)n2C3CCCCC3`, which also has a mix of cyclic and aromatic features.)

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.5058680696074463
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **High Positive Values (~1.214):**
   - Small, non-aromatic, halogenated (e.g., **CC(C)Br**, **ClC(Br)Br**) or simple aliphatic compounds (e.g., **CO**, **CC1CCCO1**, **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO**).
   - These molecules lack aromaticity or complex functional groups.

2. **Moderate Positive Values (0.5–0.9):**
   - Molecules with amides, esters, or heterocycles (e.g., **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3C(O)CC21C** = 0.803, **CCCCC(=O)OC** = 0.899).
   - Example: **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (similar to the target molecule) has a value of **0.64751113**.

3. **Near-Zero Values (-0.2 to 0.2):**
   - Molecules with mixed aromatic/aliphatic or polar/nonpolar features (e.g., **CC(C#C)N(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** = -0.202).

4. **Negative Values (~-0.674):**
   - Dominated by aromatic systems, especially those with halogens (e.g., **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl**, **c1ccccc1O**, **c1ccncc1**).
   - Conjugated systems or polyaromatics (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24**).

### Target Molecule: **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**
- **Structure:** Contains a thiol (**CS**), a triazole-like heterocycle (**nnc**), an amide (**c(=O)n1N**), and a bulky **C(C)(C)C** group.
- **Similarity to Examples:**
  - **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (value = **0.64751113**) shares:
    - A heterocycle with N and O.
    - A **C(C)(C)C** group.
    - An amide-like moiety.
  - The target lacks the **O** in the ring but has a **CS** group, which is less polar than **O** but still contributes to moderate polarity.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (0.647), but with a slightly less polar **CS** replacing **O**, the value might be slightly lower. However, the **C(C)(C)C** group and heterocycle suggest a positive value in the **0.5–0.7** range.

**Predicted Property Value: 0.58455866**  
*(This matches the value of **CCNc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(OC)n1**, which has a similar heterocycle and alkyl/amide features.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.2548076202467138
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values seem to cluster around certain key values (e.g., 1.21408337, -0.67449076, etc.) based on structural features. For the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate), I note the following:

1. **Aromatic ring presence**: Many aromatic compounds (especially simple ones like benzene derivatives) tend to have the value **-0.67449076** (e.g., Nc1ccccc1, O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, etc.).
2. **Ester functional group (-COO-)**: The molecule has an ester group, which is somewhat polar but not strongly electron-withdrawing or donating in a way that drastically changes the property from the aromatic baseline.
3. **Lack of strong polar/ionic groups**: No OH, NH2, or other strongly polar groups are present to shift the value toward positive numbers (like 1.21408337, which is often associated with aliphatic alcohols or hydrocarbons).

Comparing to similar structures:
- **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C** (an ester + aromatic system) has a value of **0.20684383**, but it has additional complexity.
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C** (multiple amides) has **0.58455866**, but this is not directly comparable.
- Simple aromatic systems with minor substitutions (e.g., Cl, Br, NO2) tend to retain the **-0.67449076** value unless the substituent is highly polar.

Given that ethyl benzoate is a simple aromatic ester without strongly perturbing substituents, the most likely property value is the recurring **-0.67449076**, which appears consistently for similar aromatic systems.

### Predicted property value: **-0.67449076**
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain trends in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Simple aliphatic chains with polar end groups (e.g., -OH, -Br, -I, -NO2) tend to have high positive values around 1.21408337:
   - CSSC: 1.21408337
   - OCC(O)C(O)CO: 1.21408337
   - CCN(=O)=O: 1.21408337
   - CI: 1.21408337
   - CCCC=C: 0.74193984 (slightly lower for double bond)

2. The presence of bromine (Br) in aliphatic chains appears to follow this high-value trend, similar to other halogens like I and Cl in simple structures.

3. The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a simple 7-carbon aliphatic chain with a bromine terminus, structurally similar to other high-value examples like CI (1.21408337) and CCCC=C (0.74193984), but more similar to the fully saturated cases.

Given that:
- Long aliphatic chains with simple polar termini tend toward ~1.21408337
- Bromine behaves similarly to other halogens in this context
- No complicating aromatic or multiple functional groups are present

The most reasonable prediction for CCCCCCCBr is: 1.21408337
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain values, particularly **1.21408337** for small, simple, and often non-polar or slightly polar molecules (e.g., `CCC`, `CCBr`, `CCC(C)CO`, `ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl`). 

The molecule `CO` (carbon monoxide) is a small, linear molecule with a polar bond but no significant functional complexity or aromaticity. Given the trend in the data, small molecules like this often have the property value **1.21408337**. 

Additionally, other small molecules with limited functional groups (e.g., `CCC`, `CC(C)C`, `CCBr`) consistently have this value, suggesting that `CO` would likely follow the same pattern.

### Predicted property value for `CO`: **1.21408337**

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC

To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alcohols/Ethers**: 
   - Molecules like **OCC(O)C(O)CO**, **CCC(C)C**, **CCOC(=O)N**, **CCCC**, **CC(C)C(C)O**, **BrC(Cl)Cl**, etc., have a property value of **1.21408337**. These are generally small, saturated, and contain oxygen (alcohols, ethers) or halogens without significant conjugation or aromaticity.

2. **Aromatic/Conjugated Systems**:
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1I**, **Oc1ccncc1**, **N#Cc1ccccc1**) or conjugated systems tend to have negative or lower property values (e.g., **-0.67449076**, **-0.40469446**).

3. **Carbonyl Groups (Ketones, Esters, Amides)**:
   - Molecules with carbonyl groups (C=O) but no strong conjugation or aromaticity (e.g., **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**) have intermediate values (e.g., **0.85435496**).
   - Esters like **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** have a value of **1.02522595**.

4. **Complexity and Functional Groups**:
   - More complex molecules with multiple functional groups or rings (e.g., steroids, polycyclic systems) tend to have values between **0.5 and 1.0**.

### Analysis of **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is an ester: **hexanoic acid ethyl ester** (ethyl hexanoate). 
- It has a saturated alkyl chain (**CCCCCC**) and an ester group (**C(=O)OCC**). 
- No aromaticity or strong conjugation is present. 
- Similar to **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (nonanoic acid methyl ester), which has a value of **1.02522595**, but with a slightly shorter chain and an ethyl ester instead of methyl ester.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to other esters and saturated alkyl chains, the property value for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is likely close to **1.02522595**. However, since the chain is shorter (C6 vs. C9), the value might be slightly higher, but the ester group dominates the trend. 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**1.02522595**
