SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.3174205400536661
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can analyze the given molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** and predict its property value by comparing it to structurally similar molecules in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Long Hydrocarbon Chain with Ester Group**:  
   The molecule has a long hydrocarbon chain (**CCCCCCCCC**) and an ester group (**CC(=O)OC**). This is similar to:  
   - **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (given in the examples with a property value of **0.96639036**).  
   This is an exact match, so the predicted value should be the same.

2. **Comparison to Other Esters/Aliphatic Chains**:  
   - **CCCCCC(=O)OC** (not explicitly in the dataset, but similar to **CCOC(=O)CC** with a value of **-0.67357611**). However, the longer chain and presence of the ester group in **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** suggest a higher value due to increased hydrophobicity and molecular weight.  
   - **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is also structurally similar to **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (value = **0.96639036**), which confirms consistency.

3. **Trends in the Data**:  
   - Longer aliphatic chains with polar groups (e.g., esters, alcohols) tend to have higher property values than shorter chains.  
   - For example:  
     - **CCCCCC(C)O** (shorter chain) = **-0.31967432**  
     - **CCCCCCCC(C)O** (longer chain) = **-0.1494452**  
     - **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (ester with long chain) = **0.96639036**  

### Conclusion:  
The molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is identical to one of the examples provided, which has a property value of **0.96639036**. Therefore, the predicted value is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.96639036**

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.27106917997738333
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **benzofuran-2-one-like** structure (a benzene fused to a lactone-like ring with a carbonyl group and NH). This is a heterocyclic system with aromatic and polar components.
2. **Substituents**: 
   - A **chlorine (Cl)** substituent on the benzene ring (electron-withdrawing, increases polarity).
   - A **lactam-like** group (NH and C=O in the fused ring), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
3. **Polarity**: The presence of Cl, C=O, and NH suggests moderate to high polarity.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Cl-containing aromatic systems** (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, property = 1.75787673) tend to have positive property values (~1-3 range when multiple Cl atoms are present).
- **Heterocycles with C=O and NH** (e.g., C1SC(=S)NC1(=O), property = -0.53212176; O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1, property = -0.76799194) tend to have negative or near-zero values unless heavily substituted with halogens or other groups.
- The given molecule is a hybrid: it has a **single Cl** but also a polar heterocycle with NH and C=O. This suggests a balance between positive (Cl contribution) and negative (polar heterocycle contribution) effects.

### Estimated Property:
Given the single Cl and the polar heterocycle, the property value is likely in the **low positive range**, similar to molecules like:
- **Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property = 0.23399166): Multiple Cl atoms offset by polar OH.
- **Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C** (property = 0.40392827): Cl + polar heterocycle + bulky groups.

For **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, the property is likely slightly lower than the above due to fewer Cl atoms but still positive due to the aromatic Cl and polar heterocycle.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.35** (estimated range: 0.2 to 0.5). 

This balances the electron-withdrawing Cl (increasing the property) and the polar heterocycle (decreasing it slightly). 

Thus, the final predicted value is:  
**0.35** (rounded to two decimal places).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data.)

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7606376089603742
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitrogen-containing functional groups** (e.g., nitro, nitroso, amide, etc.) tend to have negative property values unless they are part of a complex or aromatic system.
   - Example: `Nc1nccs1` (thiazole derivative) = -0.6814  
     `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` (fluorinated imidazole) = -0.6256  
     `NC(=O)NC1NC(=O)NC1=O` (cyclic urea) = -0.5326  

2. **Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`)** appear in some examples:
   - `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` (nitro-substituted imidazole) = -0.3107  
   - Nitro groups are electronegative and polar, often contributing to negative property values unless balanced by other structural features (e.g., aromaticity or bulk).

3. **Aliphatic nitro compounds** (like `CC(C)N(=O)=O`):
   - Simpler aliphatic nitro compounds (e.g., nitromethane, nitroethane) are not in the examples, but analogous aliphatic compounds with polar groups (e.g., `CCCOCC` = -0.6764, `CCCCCl` = -0.6987) suggest negative values.  
   - The nitro group is more polar than ether or halogen substituents, so we might expect a slightly less negative value than, say, `CCCCCl` (-0.6987) but more negative than `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` (-0.3107, where the nitro group is part of an aromatic system).

4. **Steric effects**: The `CC(C)` (isopropyl) group adds slight steric bulk but is not as influential as aromatic conjugation.

### Prediction:
Given the above, **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is an aliphatic nitro compound, likely with a property value between **-0.4 and -0.6**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

This balances the electronegativity of the nitro group with the aliphatic nature of the isopropyl substituent, consistent with the trends in the provided data.

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 5.673075656519932
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups, particularly those involving aromaticity, halogenation, carbonyl groups, and ring systems. The property values tend to increase with:

1. **Aromatic rings and conjugated systems** (higher values for polycyclic aromatics like `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` with a value of 3.87968159).
2. **Halogenation** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a value of 4.09354361).
3. **Carbonyl groups (C=O) and other polar functional groups** (e.g., `CC(C)OC(=O)C(O)(c1ccc(Br)cc1)c2ccc(Br)cc2` has a value of 5.36771291).
4. **Complexity and size of the molecule** (e.g., steroids or polycyclic structures have higher values).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
`CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO`

This is a **steroid-like polycyclic structure** with:
- Multiple fused rings (high complexity).
- A hydroxyl group (`OH`).
- A carbonyl group (`C=O`).
- A hydroxymethyl group (`CH2OH`).

Comparable examples:
- `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` (a steroid with two carbonyls) has a value of **4.96547058**.
- The target molecule has similar features but also includes an additional hydroxyl and hydroxymethyl group, which may slightly increase polarity/complexity.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to the steroid example but with additional polar groups, the predicted value would be **slightly higher** than 4.96547058. 

**Final Prediction: ~5.2**  
(Reasoning: The extra polar groups and slightly higher complexity justify a small increase over the closest example.)

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 2.042764470130697
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). Aromatic rings with halogens are present in many examples, and their contributions vary based on substitution patterns.
   - Example: `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` has a value of **0.02022094** (chlorinated biphenyl-like structure).
   - Example: `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` has a value of **-0.57521224** (heavily fluorinated benzene).

2. **Amide groups**: The molecule has two amide linkages (`C(=O)NC(=O)N`). Amides are polar and can lower the property value (more negative).
   - Example: `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` (thiourea-like) has a value of **-0.07463993**.
   - Example: `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` has a value of **-0.5432994**.

3. **Halogen substituents**: 
   - Fluorine substituents (`Fc1cccc(F)c1`) are present, similar to `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` (**-0.57521224**).
   - Chlorine substituent (`c2ccc(Cl)cc2`) is present, similar to `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (**-0.44373403**).

4. **Conjugation and size**: The molecule is conjugated and moderately large (but not as large as some high-value examples like long alkanes or steroids).

### Observations:
- The presence of multiple halogens (F, Cl) and polar amides suggests a negative contribution to the property.
- The molecule is more complex than simple halogenated benzenes but lacks the extreme size or hydrophobicity of high-value examples (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` with **19.5564339**).
- The closest analogs are halogenated aromatics with polar groups, which tend to have values in the range of **-0.2 to -0.6**.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to molecules like `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` (**-0.57521224**) and `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (**-0.44373403**), but with additional amide groups (which further lower the value), a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

This balances the contributions of the halogens (negative but not extreme) and the amides (strongly negative). The value is likely closer to the more polar examples like `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (**-0.5432994**) but slightly less negative due to the larger size. 

Thus, the final predicted value is:  
**-0.45** (approximate).

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.5767527020043305
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropoxypropane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Ethers**: 
   - Simple alkanes and ethers tend to have negative or low positive property values.
   - Example: `CCOC(=O)CC` (ethyl propanoate) has a value of **-0.67357611**.
   - Example: `CCCCCO` (pentanol) has a value of **-0.67977299**.
   - Example: `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (branched alcohol) has a value of **-0.46390755**.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - Ethers (`-O-`) generally have slightly higher (less negative) values than pure hydrocarbons but still tend to be negative or near zero.
   - Example: `COc1ccccc1O` (methoxy phenol) has a value of **-0.49395664**.

3. **Branching Effects**:
   - Branched chains (like `CC(C)C`) tend to have slightly less negative values than linear chains.
   - Example: `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` (branched alkane) has a value of **-0.20926496**.

4. **Specific Comparison**:
   - The molecule `CCCOC(C)C` is structurally similar to `CCCCCO` (pentanol) but with an ether linkage instead of a hydroxyl group. Ethers are less polar than alcohols, so the value might be slightly less negative than `CCCCCO` (-0.67977299) but still negative.

### Prediction for CCCOC(C)C:
- The molecule is a branched ether with no strongly polar or aromatic features.
- Based on the examples, the value is likely in the range of **-0.4 to -0.6**.
- A reasonable estimate is **-0.55**, considering the ether linkage and branching.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCOC(C)C** is **-0.55**.

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.5795378215554479
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a substituted uracil derivative (or similar heterocycle) with:
   - A bromine substituent (Br), which is electronegative and bulky.
   - A carbonyl group (C=O) and an amide-like [nH] group, contributing to polarity and hydrogen bonding potential.
   - An alkyl group (CCC(C)), which adds hydrophobicity.

2. **Key Features**:
   - **Bromine (Br)**: Present in other molecules like `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (property = -0.00355366) and `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` (property = 3.46458368). Bromine tends to increase the property value when combined with polar/aromatic systems.
   - **Carbonyl/Amide Groups**: Present in molecules like `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (property = -0.16385983) and `CC23Cc1cnoc1C=C2CCC4C3CCC5(C)C4CCC5(O)C#C` (property = 6.42312246). These groups can increase the property value if part of a conjugated system.
   - **Alkyl Group (CCC(C))**: Adds hydrophobicity, which may slightly decrease the property (e.g., `CCC(C)CC` has -0.6142039).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3` (property = 1.14093146): Aromatic with nitrogen, similar to the heterocycle here.
   - `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` (property = 3.46458368): Contains Br, carbonyl, and aromaticity, similar to our molecule but more polar.
   - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (property = -0.00355366): Simpler Br-substituted aromatic, but less conjugated.

### Synthesis of Observations:
- The presence of Br and the conjugated carbonyl/amide system in the heterocycle will likely increase the property value compared to simple alkyl/aromatic molecules.
- The alkyl group (CCC(C)) will temper this increase slightly.
- The closest analogs suggest a value between **0.5 and 2.5**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of these features, a reasonable estimate is:  
**1.75**  

This aligns with the trend observed for similar structures (e.g., brominated polar aromatics with conjugated systems).

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.16515306600372284
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic rings and conjugation**: 
   - Molecules with multiple aromatic rings (especially fused or conjugated systems) tend to have higher property values. For example:
     - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (coronene, a large fused aromatic system) has a very high value of **9.477**.
     - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a fused aromatic system) has a value of **3.409**.
   - Simpler aromatic systems like **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene) or **c1ccccc1** (benzene) are not explicitly listed, but substituted benzenes with polar groups tend to have lower values (e.g., **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** has **-0.257**).

2. **Biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2)**:
   - This is two benzene rings connected by a single bond, allowing some conjugation but not as extensive as fused rings.
   - Compared to fused systems like **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (value = 3.409), biphenyl is less conjugated, so its value should be lower.
   - Compared to simpler aromatic systems with polar groups (values around **-0.2 to 0.3**), biphenyl lacks polar groups and has more conjugation, so its value should be higher.

3. **Similar examples**:
   - **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (a naphthalene derivative with methyl groups) has a value of **0.249**.
   - **C1CCc2ccccc2C1** (a benzene ring fused to a cyclohexane) has a value of **-0.226**.
   - Biphenyl is more conjugated than these but less than fused polyaromatics.

### Prediction:
Given the above, biphenyl likely has a property value between **0.5 and 1.5**, leaning toward the lower end due to lack of fusion or polar groups. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.85** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend of increasing values with larger conjugated systems.)
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.6356710643064837
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule **CCCCS** (1-butanethiol), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Structural Features**:
   - **CCCCS** is a simple aliphatic thiol (4-carbon chain with a terminal -SH group).
   - It lacks aromatic rings, complex functional groups, or halogens, which tend to increase the property value in the examples (e.g., Cl, Br, NO2, or fused rings).
   - The molecule is somewhat similar to **CCCCCC(C)C** (property: -0.367) or **CCC1CCCCC1** (property: -0.432), which are simple alkanes or cycloalkanes with low property values.

2. **Impact of the Thiol Group (-SH)**:
   - The presence of sulfur might slightly increase the property compared to pure hydrocarbons, but not drastically (e.g., **CCNC(=S)NCC** with a thiourea-like structure has a property of -0.336).
   - No examples of simple thiols are given, but sulfur-containing groups in the dataset (e.g., thiourea, thioamide) tend to have modest property values (around -0.3 to 0.6).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCCC(=C)C** (property: -0.615) is a branched alkene, and **CC(C)I** (property: -0.627) is a simple halogenated alkane. These have slightly lower values, but **CCCCS** is less polarizable than iodine-containing compounds.
   - **CCCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (property: 0.142) has an ester and aniline group, which increase the value, but **CCCCS** lacks such polar groups.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Given the simplicity of **CCCCS** and the trends in the dataset, its property value is likely slightly higher than simple alkanes but lower than most polar or aromatic molecules.
   - A reasonable estimate would be around **-0.3 to -0.1**.

**Final Predicted Property Value for CCCCS: -0.25** (interpolated based on the dataset trends). 

This is an educated guess given the limited examples of sulfur-containing aliphatic compounds in the provided data. For higher accuracy, more examples of thiols or explicit modeling would be needed.

Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.4632900747755164
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Size**: Larger, more hydrophobic molecules (e.g., with long alkyl chains or aromatic rings) tend to have higher property values. For example:
   - **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (steroid-like structure) has a high value of **4.96547058**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (highly chlorinated aromatic) has a very high value of **5.22841435**.

2. **Polar Functional Groups**: Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NH₂, -COO⁻) tend to have lower (more negative) property values. For example:
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (-0.46076979) has an amine group.
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (-0.45244959) has an ester group.

3. **Branching vs. Linearity**: Branched alkanes tend to have slightly lower property values than linear alkanes of similar size. For example:
   - **CCC(C)(C)C** (-0.6142039) is branched, while **CCCC/C=C/C** (-0.502502) is linear (with a double bond).

4. **Effect of -OH Group**: The presence of an -OH group significantly reduces the property value. For example:
   - **CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O** (-0.05284982) has an -OH group.
   - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (-0.46194101) has an -OH group.

### Analysis of **CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
- The molecule is a branched alkane (**C5 chain with two methyl branches**) with a terminal **-OH group** (primary alcohol).
- Similar molecules in the examples:
  - **CC(C)CC(C)O** (-0.582482): Branched C5 with -OH, property = -0.582482.
  - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (-0.46194101): Branched C6 with -OH, property = -0.46194101.
  - **CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O** (-0.05284982): Cyclic with -OH, property = -0.05284982.

Given that **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is a branched C6 with a terminal -OH, its property value should be slightly less negative than **CC(C)CC(C)O** (C5 with -OH) but more negative than **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (C6 with -OH on a tertiary carbon). 

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is between **-0.50 and -0.60**. Averaging the closest examples:
- **CC(C)CC(C)O**: -0.582482
- **CCCC(C)(O)CC**: -0.46194101

The predicted value for **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is approximately **-0.52**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.52** (estimated based on similar structures in the dataset).

Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.007492769566448637
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic systems like benzene (**c1ccccc1**) have a property value of **-0.68308167**.
   - Adding a methyl group (**Cc1ccccc1**) slightly increases the value (though not explicitly given, similar substitutions in other molecules show this trend).
   - Fused aromatic rings (e.g., naphthalene-like structures) tend to increase the property value. For example:
     - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (methyl-substituted naphthalene) has a value of **0.24870092**.
     - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (a more complex fused aromatic system) has a value of **1.17047034**.

2. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Methyl groups (**C**) generally increase the property value slightly compared to unsubstituted aromatics.
   - Larger or more polar substituents (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, halogens) can further influence the value, but here we only have a methyl group.

3. **Specific Comparison**:
   - The target molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is a methyl-substituted naphthalene (methyl group on one benzene ring of naphthalene). This is very similar to **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (value = **0.24870092**), where the methyl group is also on a naphthalene system. The only difference is the position of the methyl group, which may not drastically change the property.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (value = **0.24870092**), the property value for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** should be close. The methyl group's position may slightly affect the value, but not significantly. 

Thus, a reasonable prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.25** (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity, but the exact value is likely close to the example, e.g., **0.24870092**).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is **0.25**.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 0.8956773973358745
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic urea derivative with two carbonyl groups. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **-0.1675864**.  
   - The core is polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (due to NH and C=O groups), which typically reduces hydrophobicity (logP) but may not dominate if bulky substituents are present.

2. **Substituents**:  
   - The hydantoin core is substituted with a **branched alkyl chain (C(C)CCC)** and a **vinyl group (CC=C)**.  
   - The **C(C)CCC** group adds significant hydrophobicity (similar to **CC(C)CC** or **CCCC** in other examples).  
   - The **CC=C** group is moderately hydrophobic (similar to **C=C** or **CC=C** in other examples).

3. **Comparison to Examples**:  
   - The closest analog in the examples is **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (property = **-0.1675864**).  
   - The additional **C(C)CCC** substituent here is more hydrophobic than the **C** in the example, so we expect the property value to increase (become less negative/more positive) due to the extra alkyl chain.  
   - For reference:  
     - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** has a value of **-0.46390755**.  
     - **CC(C)CO** has a value of **-0.76403753**.  
     - The vinyl group (**CC=C**) is less hydrophobic than a full alkyl chain but more than a single carbon.

### Prediction:
Given the increased hydrophobicity from the **C(C)CCC** group compared to the example with **C**, we can estimate that the property value will be slightly higher than **-0.1675864** but still negative due to the polar hydantoin core.  

A reasonable prediction would be in the range of **-0.1 to 0.1**. Considering the balance between the polar core and the hydrophobic substituents, I predict:  
**Predicted property value: -0.05**  

(Note: If the property is logP, this suggests a nearly neutral partition coefficient, slightly favoring water due to the polar core.)  

---  
**Final answer: -0.05**  

(If more precision is needed, a refined estimate could be **-0.08**, but the value is likely close to zero due to competing effects.)

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.5752122420067356
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Hydrocarbons**: 
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): -0.70678883  
   - **CCC=C** (butene): -0.7869265  
   - **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane): -0.74456881  
   These have low (negative) values, suggesting that aliphatic hydrocarbons contribute negatively to the property.

2. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (polycyclic aromatic): 3.87968159  
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3c4ccccc4ccc23** (polycyclic aromatic): 2.6845579  
   Aromaticity increases the property, especially with fused rings.

3. **Substituents on Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (chloro-iodobenzene): -0.18459322  
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): 3.15946739  
   Halogens (Cl, I) have mixed effects, but multiple halogens (especially Cl) increase the property.  
   - **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is analogous to these but with **CF3** (strongly electron-withdrawing).

4. **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**:
   - **COC(=O)c1cccnc1** (ester + pyridine): -0.46883679  
   - **CNC(=O)Oc1ccc(N(C)C)c(C)c1** (carbamate + dimethylamino): 0.70951813  
   Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., esters, carbamates) can increase or decrease the property depending on context.

5. **CF3 Group**:
   - No direct examples with **CF3**, but **Cl** and other halogens show that electronegative substituents on aromatics can increase the property (e.g., hexachlorobiphenyl: 3.15946739).  
   - **CF3** is more electron-withdrawing than **Cl**, so it may have a similar or stronger effect.

### Prediction for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1:
- The molecule is a monosubstituted benzene with a **CF3** group, which is strongly electron-withdrawing.  
- Comparing to **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (-0.18459322) and **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (3.15946739), the property increases with more halogens.  
- **CF3** is bulkier and more withdrawing than a single **Cl**, so the property should be higher than **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** but likely lower than heavily chlorinated aromatics.  

### Estimated Property:
A reasonable prediction is **~0.5 to 1.5**. Given the trends, I'll predict:  
**0.85** (specific value based on interpolation of halogenated aromatic examples).  

### Final Answer:
**0.85**

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.45733533333094606
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, aromaticity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar derivative (likely a hexose like glucose or mannitol). 

Key observations from the examples:
1. Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`) tend to have moderately negative property values (e.g., -0.39191674), as they are highly polar and hydrophilic but lack aromaticity or complex functional groups.
2. The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups in a cyclic structure (as in this case) does not drastically change this trend, as seen with similar polyols.
3. No other strongly contributing features (e.g., aromatic rings, nitro groups, halogens) are present here.

Given these patterns, the predicted property value for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** would likely be **similar to or slightly more negative than the linear polyol example** due to the cyclic structure's constrained geometry. 

**Predicted property value: -0.45 to -0.60**  
A reasonable estimate would be **-0.50**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is based on the trend of polar, non-aromatic molecules in the given data.)

Iteration: 15
SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 9.296420158516554
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, polar groups, and halogen substitutions. Higher values are associated with larger, more complex molecules with multiple functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, halogens, sulfur, or phosphorus), while simpler or less polar molecules tend to have lower (often negative) values.

The molecule in question is:
**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural features:
1. **Multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)**: There are at least three carbonyl groups (two esters and one ketone), which increase polarity and likely the property value.
2. **Steroid-like polycyclic structure**: The molecule has a fused 4-ring system (resembling steroid cores), which is highly complex and bulky.
3. **Hydroxyl groups (OH)**: Two hydroxyl groups further increase polarity.
4. **Conjugated double bond (C=CC)**: Adds some electronic delocalization.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (property = 6.58093762): This is very similar but lacks the hydroxyl groups and has one fewer carbonyl. The presence of additional polar groups (OH) and a conjugated double bond in the query molecule suggests a higher value.
- **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** (property = 4.17329955): This has fewer carbonyls and no ester groups, so the query molecule should be higher.
- **OCC3OC(OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C(O)C3O** (property = 8.39485676): This is a highly polar sugar derivative with many hydroxyls and an aromatic group, but the query molecule's polycyclic core and multiple carbonyls are also significant contributors.

### Predicted property value:
Given the structural similarity to **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (6.58093762) but with additional polar groups (OH) and a conjugated double bond, the value should be slightly higher. 

**Predicted property value: ~6.8**  
(A reasonable estimate would be between **6.7 and 7.0**, but I'll refine it to **6.85** based on the additional polar contributions.)  

### Final answer:
**6.85**
==================================================
Iteration: 16
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 3.2971810162540667
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group contributions. The molecule in question is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, an alcohol group (-OH), and a ketone group (C=O). 

Breaking it down:
1. **Molecular complexity**: The molecule has four fused rings (steroid backbone), which increases complexity and likely contributes positively to the property value.
2. **Functional groups**: 
   - The hydroxyl group (-OH) is polar and can form hydrogen bonds, which tends to increase the property value (as seen in similar molecules like `Oc1ccccc1Cl` and `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O`).
   - The ketone (C=O) is also polar and contributes positively (e.g., `CC1=C(SCCO1)C(=O)Nc2ccccc2` has a value of 1.169).
3. **Comparison to similar molecules**:
   - `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` has a value of 2.650, and it shares similarities (fused rings, -OH group).
   - `O=C1N(COC(=O)C)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` has a value of 3.839, with polar groups and fused rings.

Given the steroid-like structure with -OH and C=O, the property value is likely higher than simpler aromatic alcohols but not as high as highly conjugated or multi-halogenated systems (e.g., `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` with 5.228). 

### Predicted property value: **2.85** (estimated range: 2.6–3.1, based on structural similarity to examples). 

This is a rough estimate based on the trends observed in the provided data. For precise predictions, computational methods or experimental measurements would be necessary.

Iteration: 17
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.05063288662895625
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH3-CO-NH-)**: Present in the molecule (CC(=O)N-). 
     - Example with acetamide-like group: `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (property = 0.54987622).
   - **Nitro group (-NO2)**: Attached to the aromatic ring (N(=O)=O). 
     - Examples with nitro groups:
       - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (property = -0.53471543).
       - `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (property = -0.34590807).
       - `O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12` (property = 0.09981207).
   - **Aromatic ring**: Substituted with both acetamide and nitro groups.

2. **Similar Molecules**:
   - The molecule resembles a combination of acetamide and nitrobenzene-like structures.
   - `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` (property = 1.26186032) has a nitro group and an amide, though it is more complex.
   - `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (property = 0.54987622) has an amide but no nitro group.

3. **Electron-Withdrawing Effects**:
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which may increase the property value compared to simple aromatic systems.
   - The acetamide group is moderately electron-withdrawing (due to the carbonyl) but also has some electron-donating character (via the NH group).

4. **Trends**:
   - Nitro groups on aromatic rings tend to increase the property value (e.g., compare `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (-0.53471543) to `O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12` (0.09981207)).
   - Amide groups also tend to increase the property value compared to purely aliphatic or simple aromatic systems.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of both an acetamide and a nitro group on the aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be in the **moderately positive range**, similar to or slightly higher than molecules like `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (0.54987622) or `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` (1.26186032). 

However, since the nitro group is directly attached to the ring (stronger effect) and the acetamide is also present, the value is likely closer to **~0.8 to 1.2**.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O: 0.95**

Iteration: 18
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 4.901495609207806
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC))**: This is a polar and moderately bulky group, similar to phosphate or sulfonate groups in the examples. Such groups can increase the property value due to their polarity and size.
2. **Thioether linkage (SC)**: The sulfur atom can contribute to higher property values, as seen in molecules like **CSSC** (-0.671) or sulfur-containing heterocycles.
3. **Chlorinated aromatic ring (cc(Cl)ccc12)**: Chlorine substituents on aromatic rings appear in several examples, with property values ranging from **-0.284 (Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1)** to **0.808 (Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2)**.
4. **Lactam-like heterocycle (n1c(=O)oc2)**: This resembles a fused heterocyclic system with carbonyl groups, which can increase the property value (e.g., **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** has a value of **3.702**).
5. **Ethoxy groups (CCOP and OCC)**: Alkoxy groups tend to have a modest effect, often slightly reducing the property value (e.g., **CCCO** has **-0.832**).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The molecule combines features from:
  - **Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (0.020)** (chlorinated biphenyl-like).
  - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 (3.702)** (heterocycle with carbonyl and sulfur).
  - **CSSC (-0.671)** (sulfur-sulfur bond).
  - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 (0.808)** (chlorinated biphenyl).

Given the presence of **P(=S)**, **Cl**, and a fused heterocycle with **C=O**, the property value is likely elevated compared to simple chlorinated aromatics but not as high as large polycyclic systems (e.g., **16.461**). 

### Estimated Property Value:
Considering the contributions:
- The phosphorothioate and thioether could add ~1.5–2.0.
- The chlorinated aromatic heterocycle could add ~1.0–1.5.
- The ethoxy groups might slightly offset this.

A reasonable prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: 2.5 ± 0.5**  

Given the examples, a more precise estimate would be:  
**Predicted value: 2.8** (similar to **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 (3.702)** but less due to fewer aromatic rings).  

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 2.8**
==================================================
Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.6811477067666343
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations:
1. **Alcohols (-OH group)**:
   - Simple alcohols with short carbon chains tend to have negative property values:
     - **CCC (propane)**: -0.85122076 (no -OH)
     - **CC(C)CO (isobutanol)**: Not in the list, but similar to **CC(C)CO**.
     - **CC(C)CO** is structurally similar to **CC(C)CO** (same formula, but branched).
   - **CC(C)CO (tert-butanol)**: This is a tertiary alcohol with a branched structure. 

2. **Branching Effects**:
   - Branching tends to slightly increase the property value compared to linear chains (e.g., **CC(C)CO** vs. **CCO**).
   - Example: **CC(C)CO** (tert-butanol) is more branched than **CCCO** (butanol), which is not in the list, but branching generally reduces hydrophobicity (though the property here seems more complex).

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)CO** is similar to **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol), which is not explicitly listed, but we can compare to:
     - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O**: -0.07106284 (branched with aromatic ring)
     - **CC(C)CO**: Simpler, so likely more negative.
   - **CC(C)CO** is also similar to **CC(C)CO** (isopropanol), which is not listed, but **CC(C)CO** is more branched.

4. **Trend for Tertiary Alcohols**:
   - Tertiary alcohols (like **CC(C)(C)CO**) are more sterically hindered, which may slightly increase the property value compared to primary/secondary alcohols.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- The property value for **CC(C)(C)CO** (tert-butanol) is likely slightly higher (less negative) than simpler alcohols like **CCCO** (butanol) or **CCO** (ethanol), but still negative.
- Comparing to **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol), which is not listed, but **CC(C)(C)CO** is more branched, so the value might be slightly less negative.

From the examples:
- **CC(C)CO** (similar but not identical) is not listed, but **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** has -0.07106284.
- Simpler alcohols like **CCO** (ethanol) are not listed, but **CCC** (propane) is -0.85122076.

Given the branching and -OH group, a reasonable estimate for **CC(C)(C)CO** is between **-0.5 and -0.7**.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.65** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The property could be logP, solubility, or another molecular descriptor, but the trend suggests higher branching reduces the magnitude of negative values.)

Iteration: 20
SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -0.49796196864475384
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Heterocyclic Core**: The molecule is a fused bicyclic system with two nitrogen-containing rings (imidazole and pyrimidine-like). It resembles purine-like structures but with additional carbonyl (=O) and NH groups.
2. **Polar Functional Groups**: 
   - Carbonyl (C=O) group: Increases polarity and may contribute to higher property values (as seen in other carbonyl-containing molecules).
   - Multiple NH groups: Can participate in hydrogen bonding, increasing polarity.
3. **Aromaticity**: The system is aromatic, which typically contributes to intermediate property values (neither very high nor very low).
4. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Similar to **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (property = -0.62559347), but our molecule has more hydrogen-bonding capability and lacks the electron-withdrawing fluorine.
   - Similar to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)CC=C** (property = 0.26667525), which has multiple carbonyls and NH groups but is non-aromatic.
   - The fused aromatic system with polar groups is somewhat like **Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23** (property = 0.23124638), but our molecule has more hydrogen-bonding groups.

### Predicted Property:
Given the presence of multiple hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors (NH and C=O) and aromaticity, the property value is likely in the **slightly positive range**, similar to other polar heterocycles in the examples. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property = 0.15**  

This is based on:
- The molecule being more polar than simple aromatics (which have negative values) but less extreme than large polyfunctional molecules (which have very high values).
- The closest analog (**Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F**) has a negative value, but our molecule lacks the electron-withdrawing F and has more NH groups, pushing the value slightly higher. 

Thus, the predicted property for **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** is approximately **0.15**.
==================================================
Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.758075511651288
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains and Alcohols**: 
   - Molecules like **CCCCCC(C)O** (heptan-2-ol) and **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) have negative property values (-0.46194101 and -0.83265345, respectively). 
   - The presence of oxygen (hydroxyl group) tends to reduce the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

2. **Esters and Carbonyl-Containing Compounds**:
   - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (triethyl phosphate) has a slightly negative value (-0.24803915).
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a steroid-like molecule with carbonyl and ester groups) has a high positive value (6.58093762), but this is likely due to its large, complex structure rather than just the ester group.
   - **COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67** (a very large, complex molecule with multiple functional groups) has an extremely high value (37.72919579), again due to size and complexity.

3. **Small Esters**:
   - **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate) is a small ester, similar in size to **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) but with an ester group instead of a hydroxyl group. Esters are more polar than ethers but less polar than alcohols due to the resonance stabilization of the carbonyl group.

4. **Polarity and Functional Groups**:
   - The property seems to correlate with molecular size, polarity, and functional groups. Small, polar molecules (like alcohols) tend to have negative values, while larger or more complex molecules (especially those with aromatic rings or multiple functional groups) tend to have positive values.
   - The ester group in **CC(C)OC=O** is moderately polar but not as polar as a hydroxyl group, so its value should be less negative than **CC(C)O** but still negative or close to zero.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): -0.83265345
- **CCOC=C** (ethyl vinyl ether): -0.76568646
- **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (triethyl phosphate): -0.24803915

Methyl acetate (**CC(C)OC=O**) is more polar than ethyl vinyl ether but less polar than isopropanol. Its value should be between these two, likely closer to triethyl phosphate but slightly more negative due to its smaller size.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate for **CC(C)OC=O** is:  
**-0.45**  

This is based on:
- Its small size (similar to isopropanol but with an ester group).
- Esters typically have less negative values than alcohols but are still on the lower end for small molecules.
- The closest analog in the examples is **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (-0.248), but methyl acetate is simpler, so its value should be slightly more negative.  

Thus, the predicted property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is approximately **-0.45**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend of the given data. The property could be logP, solubility, or another molecular descriptor, but the approach remains the same.)

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 1.110298925717586
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl (benzene) rings attached to the nitrogen atoms of the urea functional group (**N-C(=O)-N**). The structure can be broken down as:
- Central urea core: **N-C(=O)-N**
- Two aromatic (phenyl) rings: **c1ccccc1** and **c2ccccc2**

### Key Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - Simple benzene rings (e.g., **c1ccccc1**) tend to contribute negatively to the property (e.g., **C1CCCCC1** has -0.657).
   - Substituted aromatic rings (e.g., with halogens or polar groups) can shift the property toward less negative or positive values (e.g., **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** has +0.145).

2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Urea-like groups (**N-C(=O)-N**) are polar and can influence the property. For example:
     - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (a cyclic urea derivative) has -0.008.
     - **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** (an amide) has -0.543.

3. **Symmetry and Conjugation**:
   - The molecule is symmetric with two phenyl rings, which may stabilize the structure and reduce the magnitude of the property compared to simpler urea derivatives.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **NC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** (amide + aromatic): +0.119
- **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (cyclic urea): -0.008
- **CN(C)C=Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1C** (imine + aromatic): +0.529

Given that **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is a urea with two aromatic rings but no strongly electron-withdrawing or donating substituents, the property is likely slightly negative or close to neutral due to the balance between the polar urea group and the aromatic systems.

### Predicted Property Value:
Based on the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate is:  
**0.05** (slightly positive due to the urea group's polarity outweighing the aromatic rings' slight negative contribution). 

However, looking at the cyclic urea example (**-0.008**), this molecule is more extended and conjugated, which might push the value slightly higher. A refined estimate would be:  
**0.12** (similar to **CN(C)C=Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1C** but without the Cl substitution).

### Final Prediction:
**0.10** (a compromise between the urea and aromatic contributions). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend of the given data.)

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 0.32081283360647717
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is **fluorene**, which consists of two benzene rings fused to a central cyclopentadiene ring. It is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with a rigid, planar structure and significant aromatic character.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have low property values (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` has a value of 2.6845579, while `c1ccccc1` is not explicitly listed but derivatives like `CNc1ccccc1` have -0.45725889).
   - Larger conjugated systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatics) generally have higher values due to increased electron delocalization and surface area.

2. **Substituents**: 
   - Polar or electronegative substituents (e.g., halogens, nitro groups) can increase the property value (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` has 1.75787673).
   - Nonpolar aliphatic chains tend to decrease the value (e.g., `CCCc1ccccc1` has -0.31976857).

3. **Fluorene-Like Structures**:
   - The molecule `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (a larger PAH) has a value of 2.6845579.
   - Fluorene is smaller but has a similar fused aromatic structure.

### Prediction:
Fluorene is smaller than the example with value 2.6845579 but larger than simple benzene derivatives. It lacks polar substituents, so its value should be between 1.5 and 3.0. Given its intermediate size and rigidity, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 2.1** (approximate, based on interpolation from the examples). 

For higher precision, a value around **2.0 to 2.3** would align with the trend observed in the data. If forced to pick a specific number:  
**2.15**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, polarizability, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 0.23031045565176042
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **NC(=N)N**: A guanidine-like group (highly polar, basic).
   - **S(=O)(=O)**: A sulfonyl group (polar, electron-withdrawing).
   - **Aromatic ring with NH2**: Aniline-like (moderately polar, electron-donating).

2. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is polar due to multiple N and S=O groups.
   - It is medium-sized (not as large as some polycyclic or long-chain examples).

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with sulfonyl groups (e.g., **CCOP(=S)(OCC)ON=C(C#N)c1ccccc1**, property = 2.43063434) tend to have higher property values.
   - Molecules with aromatic rings and polar substituents (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, property = 1.23705382) also have moderate to high values.
   - The guanidine-like group adds significant polarity, similar to how multiple N or O atoms increase the property in other examples.

4. **Trends**:
   - Small, nonpolar molecules (e.g., **CC(C)Cl**) have negative values.
   - Polar/aromatic molecules with functional groups (e.g., sulfonyl, nitro, multiple halogens) have positive values.
   - Larger molecules (e.g., polycyclic aromatics or long aliphatic chains) have very high values.

### Prediction:
This molecule is polar, has a sulfonyl group, and an aromatic ring with an NH2 group, but it is not excessively large. Comparing to similar examples:
- **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (property = 1.23705382) is somewhat similar in polarity/size but lacks the sulfonyl group.
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)ON=C(C#N)c1ccccc1** (property = 2.43063434) has a sulfonyl-like group and is more complex.

Given the balance of polar groups and size, a reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than the first example but lower than the second. 

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.85** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 2.4644964967341108
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, particularly influenced by:
1. **Size and branching** (larger/highly branched molecules have higher values)
2. **Functional groups** (especially polar or conjugated systems like nitro groups, carbonyls, halogens, etc.)
3. **Aromatic systems** (polycyclic aromatics or heavily substituted rings increase the value)
4. **Special features** (e.g., steroids, long aliphatic chains, or multiple functional groups).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**  
- **Structure**: 
  - Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C)) linked to a benzene ring.
  - Two nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**) on the ring (strong electron-withdrawing effects).
  - A trifluoromethyl group (**C(F)(F)F**) on the ring (highly polar and bulky).
  - An unsaturated branch (**CC(C)=C**).
- **Key Observations**:
  - The molecule is moderately large but not as massive as steroids/long chains in the examples.
  - It has **three strongly polar substituents** (two nitro groups + CF3), which likely increase the property value significantly compared to simpler aromatics.
  - Similar examples:
    - `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` (3.46458368) has two nitro groups and a complex heterocycle.
    - `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1` (2.55157671) has polar amides and a bulky group.
    - The presence of **CF3** (similar in effect to halogens like Cl/Br) and **two nitro groups** suggests a value higher than most mono-substituted aromatics but below very large/rigid systems (e.g., steroids).

### Predicted Value:
Given the above, the molecule’s property value is likely in the range of **2.5 to 3.5**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: 3.1**  

(Justification: The combination of two nitro groups + CF3 + unsaturated branch is less complex than polycyclic systems but more polar than most examples with values ~2.5. The value is slightly lower than `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` (3.464) due to fewer fused rings.)

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.758075511651288
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Alcohols (e.g., CCCC(C)O, CCC(C)(C)O)**: Tend to have negative property values (around -0.4 to -0.68).
   - **Esters (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, CCCCCOC(=O)C)**: Tend to have moderately negative values (around -0.45 to -0.07).
   - **Aldehydes (e.g., CCCC=O, C=CC=O)**: Tend to have more negative values (around -0.77 to -0.85).
   - **Ketones (e.g., CC(=O)C, O=C1CCCCC1)**: Tend to have negative values (around -0.18 to -0.65).
   - **Complex or aromatic structures with multiple functional groups (e.g., Cl, NO2, etc.)**: Tend to have higher positive values.

2. **Molecular Size and Branching**:
   - Smaller or less branched molecules with simple functional groups tend to have more negative values.
   - Branching (e.g., CC(C)O vs. CCCC(C)O) does not drastically change the property value but may slightly lower it.

3. **Specific Examples Similar to CC(C)OC=O**:
   - **CC(C)CCOC=O**: Property value = -0.57457121 (branched ester with an aldehyde-like group).
   - **CC(=O)N**: Property value = -0.86517933 (amide, but structurally simpler).
   - **CCCC=O**: Property value = -0.77935303 (linear aldehyde).

### Analysis of CC(C)OC=O:
- The molecule is an ester (**OC=O**) with a branched alkyl group (**CC(C)**).
- Compared to **CC(C)CCOC=O** (value = -0.57457121), this molecule is smaller and less flexible (no CCO linker).
- The presence of the **C=O** (aldehyde/ester) group suggests a moderately negative value, similar to other small esters or aldehydes.
- Branching (isopropyl group) may slightly lower the value compared to linear analogs.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarities to **CC(C)CCOC=O** (-0.57457121) and **CCCC=O** (-0.77935303), and considering the smaller size of **CC(C)OC=O**, the property value is likely slightly more negative than **CC(C)CCOC=O** but less negative than **CCCC=O**. 

**Predicted value: -0.65** (reasonable estimate based on trends). 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is **-0.65**.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.4107568534572039
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a substituted benzene ring (toluene derivative) with:
   - Two methyl groups (`Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1`): one at position 1 (implicit from the `Cc1` notation) and one at position 3 (`C` in `cc(C)`).
   - A hydroxyl group (`O`) at position 5 (`cc(O)`).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Methyl groups (`-CH3`) are electron-donating and hydrophobic.
   - Hydroxyl group (`-OH`) is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.

3. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1** (property: -0.237): This has multiple hydroxyl groups and an ester, making it more polar. Our molecule has fewer hydroxyl groups and no ester, but shares some similarity in having an aromatic ring with polar substituents.
   - **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ccccc3** (property: 2.445): This is a polyaromatic hydrocarbon (no polar groups), so it's less relevant.
   - **c1ccccc1O** (property: -0.649): Phenol (benzene with one -OH). Our molecule is similar but with additional methyl groups, which are less polar and may slightly increase the property value compared to phenol.
   - **CCc1ccccc1C** (property: -0.316): This is toluene with an ethyl group (no polar groups). Our molecule has an -OH, which will increase polarity and likely the property value compared to this.

### Prediction:
- The hydroxyl group increases the property value compared to purely non-polar aromatic molecules (e.g., `CCc1ccccc1C` with -0.316).
- The methyl groups are less polar than halogens or nitro groups (which appear in higher-property molecules like `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` with 4.094), so the property won't be as high as heavily halogenated compounds.
- The closest analog is **c1ccccc1O** (phenol) with a property of -0.649. Adding two methyl groups (electron-donating, slightly increasing hydrophobicity but not drastically changing polarity) might bring the value closer to zero.

### Estimated Property:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate for **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** is slightly higher than phenol but still in the negative to low-positive range. A plausible prediction is:

**Predicted Property: -0.35**  

This accounts for the balance between the polar hydroxyl group and the non-polar methyl groups.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 1.7547893865224389
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiophosphate group (P(=S))**, which is also present in several examples (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl** with property **1.89542039**). Thiophosphate groups tend to increase the property value significantly compared to simpler aromatic or aliphatic structures.
2. **Aromatic Substitution**: The aromatic ring is substituted with:
   - A **methyl group (C)**, which is neutral/slightly reducing (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1O** has **-0.54107576**).
   - A **thioether (SC)** group, which is moderately polar but less electron-withdrawing than halogens like Cl or Br.
3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** has a property of **1.58955584** (three Cl substituents).
   - **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl** has **1.89542039** (Cl and Br substituents).
   - **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl** has **2.55878823** (Cl and I substituents, heavier halogens increase the value).

### Key Observations:
- The **SC** group is less electron-withdrawing than halogens, so the property value should be lower than the examples with Cl/Br/I.
- The **methyl group (C)** is less impactful than halogens or other polar groups.
- The **thiophosphate (P(=S))** core dominates the property value, but the substituents modulate it.

### Predicted Value:
Given the structural similarity to **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (1.58955584)** but with less electron-withdrawing groups (SC and C instead of Cl), the value should be slightly lower. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property: ~1.2 to 1.4**

For specificity, we can interpolate between the Cl/Br examples and assign:

**Final Predicted Value: 1.35**  

*(This is a manually estimated interpolation based on the substituent effects observed in the examples.)*

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 2.3906587819813696
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, halogenation (especially chlorine and bromine), aromaticity, and the presence of functional groups like sulfonamides (S(=O)(=O)N), nitro groups (NO2), or conjugated systems. The property values tend to increase with:  
- More halogen atoms (especially Cl/Br).  
- Larger aromatic systems or fused rings.  
- Polar or charged functional groups.  

For the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**:  
1. It is highly chlorinated (6 Cl atoms).  
2. It contains two fused benzene rings (naphthalene-like core with substitutions).  
3. Similar examples:  
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (3.159) has 7 Cl atoms and a biphenyl core.  
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (4.094) has 8 Cl atoms and a biphenyl core.  

This molecule has slightly fewer Cl atoms (6) but a more rigid fused-ring system, which may increase the property value compared to the first similar example but likely less than the second.  

**Predicted property value: ~3.5** (likely between 3.2 and 3.8, based on interpolation from the given data).  

*(Note: If the property is logP or solubility-related, the trend suggests higher values correlate with hydrophobicity/chlorination. If it’s a biological activity metric, the fused rings and halogens may enhance binding.)*  

**Final answer: ~3.5** (e.g., 3.5 ± 0.3).

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.760273954356653
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** (1-nitropropane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (NO2)**: 
   - The presence of a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) tends to increase the property value, especially when attached to an aromatic ring or a more complex structure. 
   - Example: `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (dicyanobenzene) has a value of -0.460, while `Nc1ccccc1O` (aminophenol) has -0.549. Nitro groups in aromatic systems (e.g., `N(=O)=O` in `CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O`) give higher values (1.554).
   - Aliphatic nitro compounds (e.g., `CCCN(=O)=O`) are less common in the examples, but simpler nitroalkanes might have lower values than aromatic nitro compounds.

2. **Aliphatic Chains**:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., `CCC` with -0.851, `CC` with -0.906) have very low (negative) values.
   - Adding polar or functional groups (e.g., `CCCCCC=O` with -0.603) increases the value slightly compared to pure alkanes.

3. **Nitroalkane Example**:
   - The closest example is `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (trinitrobenzene), which has a value of -0.093. This suggests that even with multiple nitro groups, the property can remain low if the molecule is symmetric or lacks other enhancing features.
   - For `CCCN(=O)=O`, the nitro group is attached to a short aliphatic chain (propyl), so the value should be higher than pure alkanes but lower than aromatic nitro compounds.

### Prediction:
- The nitro group will increase the value compared to propane (`CCC` with -0.851), but not as much as in aromatic systems. 
- The value likely falls between -0.5 and 0.0. 
- Given the simplicity of the molecule, a reasonable estimate is **-0.3 to -0.4**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCN(=O)=O** is approximately **-0.35**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.5088193192872554
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations:
1. **Halogen Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br, F) tend to have negative property values, but the magnitude depends on the number and type of halogens and other functional groups.
   - Example: 
     - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** → -0.36195593 (Cl and Br substitution on benzene)
     - **BrC(Br)Br** → -0.59562633 (multiple Br substitution)
     - **Fc1ccc(F)cc1** (not in the list, but similar to Cl/Br cases).

2. **Benzene Derivatives**:
   - Monosubstituted benzene rings with halogens or simple groups (e.g., methyl) tend to have values between -0.3 and -0.5.
     - **Cc1ccccc1C** → -0.45931439 (two methyl groups)
     - **COc1ccccc1Cl** → -0.39790425 (methoxy and Cl)
     - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** → -0.36195593 (Cl and Br on benzene).

3. **Fluorine vs. Chlorine/Bromine**:
   - Fluorine is more electronegative than Cl/Br but often leads to slightly less negative values than Cl/Br in similar contexts (due to smaller size and weaker steric/electronic effects).
   - Example: **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1** → -0.31074549 (F substitution with an amide group).

4. **Combined Halogens**:
   - When multiple halogens are present, the property value becomes more negative (e.g., **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** → 1.75787673, but this is an outlier due to high Cl count and complex structure).
   - For simple dihalogenated benzenes, the value is closer to the average of the individual halogens.

### Prediction for Fc1cccc(Br)c1:
- This is a benzene ring with **F** and **Br** substitutions (similar to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**, which has Cl and Br and a value of -0.36195593).
- Fluorine is less bulky and less polarizable than Cl, so its effect on the property might be slightly less negative than Cl in the same position.
- However, Br is larger and more polarizable than Cl, which could offset this slightly.

Given these observations, the property value for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is likely **slightly less negative** than **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (-0.36195593). 

### Final Prediction:
**-0.35** (rounded to two decimal places based on the trend). 

This is a reasonable estimate given the similarity to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** but accounting for the slightly weaker effect of F compared to Cl.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.14221049103577754
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a bicyclic system (decalin-like) with a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached. It has two tertiary carbons (quaternary centers) and no highly polar or charged groups beyond the -OH.
2. **Similar Examples**:
   - **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**: This is a complex steroid-like molecule with multiple rings, hydroxyl groups, and a ketone. Its property value is **11.06092384**.
   - **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**: Another steroid-like molecule with hydroxyl and ketone groups. Its property value is **7.56294397**.
   - **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: A simpler steroid-like molecule with one hydroxyl and one ketone. Its property value is **5.20919801**.
   - **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2**: A bridged bicyclic system with ester and aromatic groups. Its property value is **8.78321765**.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of a hydroxyl group and a rigid bicyclic framework tends to increase the property value compared to simpler aliphatic or aromatic molecules.
   - The absence of highly polar or conjugated systems (e.g., ketones, aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups) likely reduces the property value compared to the steroid-like examples above.
   - The molecule is simpler than the steroid-like examples but more complex than linear or monocyclic aliphatic molecules (which typically have negative or small positive values).

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to the steroid-like molecules but with fewer functional groups, the property value should be **lower than the steroid examples but still positive**. 

Looking at the examples:
- The simplest steroid-like molecule with a hydroxyl group has a value of **5.20919801**.
- The current molecule lacks ketones and other polar groups, so its value should be significantly lower but still positive due to the hydroxyl and rigid bicyclic structure.

A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **1.5 to 3.0**. 

### Final Prediction:
**2.5** (This is an approximate interpolation based on the given examples and structural features.) 

*Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.*

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 2.0659478519636947
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P=S) and Aromatic Systems**: 
   - The molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** has a property value of **6.49001155**. This shares structural similarities with the target molecule, including:
     - A **P(=S)(OCC)** group.
     - A **N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (phthalimide-like) moiety.
   - The main difference is the replacement of **SC(CCl)** with **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** in the target molecule.

2. **Impact of Substituents**:
   - The **SC(CCl)** group in the reference molecule likely contributes to the higher value (6.49). Replacing it with a less polarizable or less bulky group (like the phthalimide-like moiety in the target) might reduce the property value slightly.

3. **Other Examples**:
   - Molecules with **P(=S)** and aromatic systems tend to have higher property values (e.g., 6.49, 4.63, etc.).
   - The phthalimide-like group alone (e.g., **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**) appears in other examples with values around **2.5–4.6**, depending on additional substituents.

### Prediction:
The target molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is structurally similar to the reference molecule with a value of **6.49001155**, but the replacement of **SC(CCl)** with the phthalimide-like group may reduce the property slightly. 

Given the strong influence of the **P(=S)(OCC)** group and the aromatic system, I predict the property value to be slightly lower than 6.49 but still in the higher range. 

### Final Prediction:
**5.8** (approximate, based on structural analogy and substituent effects). 

However, looking more closely at the examples, the phthalimide-like group combined with **P(=S)(OCC)** is not directly represented, so a conservative estimate would be between **5.0 and 6.0**. 

Given the similarity to the reference molecule (6.49) but with a less bulky substituent, I refine the prediction to:  
**5.9**. 

But to align more precisely with the examples, I'll settle on:  
**5.75**. 

However, since the reference molecule with **P(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)...** is 6.49 and the target lacks the **SC(CCl)** (which likely increases the value), the target is probably lower. A reasonable estimate is:  
**5.3**. 

After reconsidering, the closest analog is the reference molecule at 6.49, and the target is slightly less "bulky" or polarizable, so:  
**5.8** is plausible. 

But to be conservative, I'll predict:  
**5.6**. 

### Final Answer:
**5.6** (estimated based on structural analogy). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The value likely represents a physicochemical property like logP, molar refractivity, or a similar descriptor.) 

---

**Correction**: Upon re-evaluating, the reference molecule with **P(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)...** is 6.49, and the target replaces **SC(CCl)** with **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, which is less bulky but still aromatic. The phthalimide-like group alone (e.g., in **CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3ccccc23**) gives ~2.59, so the **P(=S)(OCC)** group likely adds ~3.0 to the value. Thus, the target is probably closer to **5.6**. 

**Final refined prediction**: **5.6**. 

---

**Update**: The reference molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** is 6.49, and the target **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is very similar but lacks the **SC(CCl)** group. The **SC(CCl)** likely contributes ~0.8–1.0 to the value, so the target should be ~6.49 - 0.9 = **5.6**. 

**Final answer**: **5.6**. 

---

However, looking back at the examples, the **P(=S)(OCC)** group seems to dominate, and the exact substituent has a smaller effect. Thus, the target is likely very close to the reference (6.49), perhaps slightly lower. 

**Final final answer**: **6.2**. 

(But this contradicts earlier reasoning. To resolve this, I'll average the two estimates: (6.49 + 5.6)/2 = **6.045**.) 

**Final prediction**: **6.0**. 

---

Given the uncertainty, the most reasonable range is **5.6–6.2**, with **6.0** as a midpoint. 

**Final submitted prediction**: **6.0**. 

---

**Post-submission note**: If the property is logP, the value seems high, but the examples suggest it could be molar refractivity or another descriptor. Without explicit clarification, **6.0** is the best estimate. 

---

**Final decision**: **5.8**. 

(After all this back-and-forth, the most defensible estimate is **5.8**.) 

---

**Final answer**: **5.8**.

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 0.38435912414467793
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like** core with two nitrogen atoms in a 6-membered ring (similar to a pyrazine or pyrimidine derivative) and a **carbonyl group (C=O)** attached to the ring. This is somewhat analogous to the structure **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property = 2.37484791), which also has a fused aromatic system with a carbonyl group.
   
2. **Substituents**: 
   - The molecule has **two methyl groups (C)** attached to the nitrogen atoms, which are electron-donating and may slightly decrease the property value compared to more polar substituents.
   - It also has a **fused benzene ring (c2ccccc2)**, which adds aromaticity and may increase the property value.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The closest analog is **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property = 2.37484791), which has a similar fused aromatic system with a carbonyl group but lacks the diketopiperazine-like core. The presence of the **C=O** in the ring here may slightly lower the property compared to the fused system in the example.
   - Another somewhat similar structure is **O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23** (property = 0.93537483), which has a lactam-like structure but is less conjugated than our target molecule.

4. **Electronic Effects**:
   - The **carbonyl group (C=O)** is electron-withdrawing, which may increase the property value.
   - The **methyl groups (C)** are electron-donating, which may slightly counteract the effect of the carbonyl.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the structural similarities and differences, the property value for **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** is likely **between 1.5 and 2.0**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: 1.75**  

This is based on:
- The presence of the **carbonyl group** and **fused aromatic system** increasing the value (similar to the example with 2.37484791).
- The **methyl groups** and less extended conjugation slightly reducing the value compared to that example. 

Thus, the final predicted value is **1.75**.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.30831735940877014
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., **CCCCC**) have low property values (e.g., **-0.70678883**).
   - Longer or branched chains (e.g., **CCC(C)C**) tend to have slightly higher but still negative values (e.g., **-0.46329007**).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Esters (RCOOR')**: 
     - **CCOC(=O)N** has a value of **-0.77558587**.
     - **COC(=O)OC** (similar to the target molecule) has a value of **0.07050244**.
   - **Carboxylic Acids (RCOOH)**: Not directly in the examples, but esters are derivatives.
   - **Polar Groups (e.g., OH, Cl, Br)**: Increase the property value (e.g., **Cl** or **Br** substitutions raise values).

3. **Target Molecule: CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
   - This is **hexanoic acid ethyl ester** (ethyl hexanoate), an ester with a 6-carbon chain and an ethoxy group.
   - Compared to **COC(=O)OC** (methyl carbonate, value **0.07050244**), the longer alkyl chain (**CCCCCC**) may slightly decrease the property value, but the ester group's contribution is dominant.
   - The absence of highly polar or aromatic groups suggests the value will be modest, likely between **0.0 and 0.5**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the ester functionality and the alkyl chain length, a reasonable estimate is:  
**0.12** (slightly higher than **COC(=O)OC** due to the longer chain but still in the same range as other simple esters). 

However, reviewing the examples more closely:
- **CCOC(=O)N** (ethyl carbamate) has **-0.77558587**, but this includes an amide-like group (lower value).
- **COC(=O)OC** (methyl carbonate) has **0.07050244**, which is closer to the target.

Since **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is a larger ester than **COC(=O)OC**, the property value might be slightly higher due to increased hydrophobicity. A refined estimate is:  
**0.15**.

### Final Answer:
**0.15** (approximate, based on ester examples and alkyl chain effects).

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.4046879362404902
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Structural Similarity**: The molecule is an ester (COC(=O)-) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1). This is similar to:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate), which has a property value of **-0.25116819**.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate), which has a property value of **-0.18869767**.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of the ester group tends to give a slightly negative property value (around -0.2 to -0.6 in most cases).
   - The benzene ring alone (without additional substituents) does not significantly increase the property value (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2** has a higher value due to two aromatic rings and Cl substituents).
   - Methyl vs. ethyl esters seem to have very similar property values (e.g., **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** vs. **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** would likely be close).

3. **Prediction**: Since methyl benzoate (**COC(=O)c1ccccc1**) is structurally very similar to ethyl benzoate (**CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, value = -0.25116819), but with a slightly smaller alkyl group (methyl instead of ethyl), the property value should be very close, possibly slightly more negative due to the reduced size of the alkyl group.

### Final Predicted Property Value:  
**-0.28** (approximate, likely in the range of -0.25 to -0.30).  

This aligns well with the trend observed for simple aromatic esters in the dataset.
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.7102757933305367
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends related to molecular structure and the associated property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons with Conjugation or Unsaturation**:
   - **C/C=C/C** (2-butene): Property value = **-0.70853549**
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): Property value = **-0.44168361**
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): Property value = **-0.31976857**
   - **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane): Property value = **-0.74456881**

   These examples suggest that simple hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, or aromatics) tend to have negative property values, typically in the range of **-0.3 to -0.7**. Conjugated systems (like styrene) may have slightly higher (less negative) values than non-conjugated alkenes.

2. **Effect of Conjugation**:
   - The presence of conjugation (alternating single and double bonds) often increases the property value slightly compared to isolated double bonds. For example:
     - **C/C=C/C** (isolated double bond): -0.708
     - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (conjugated with aromatic ring): -0.442
     - **C=CCC=C** (conjugated diene) would likely have a higher value than **C/C=C/C** but lower than styrene.

3. **1,3-Butadiene (C=CCC=C)**:
   - This is a conjugated diene, so its property value should be higher than a non-conjugated alkene like 2-butene (-0.708) but lower than styrene (-0.442), which has additional conjugation with an aromatic ring.
   - A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.6 and -0.5**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **C=CCC=C** is approximately:  
**-0.55**

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, polarizability, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. The value is consistent with the observed trend where conjugation increases the property value slightly compared to non-conjugated analogs. 

**Final answer: -0.55** (approximate; likely between -0.6 and -0.5)
==================================================
Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: -0.5956263268177739
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobenzene derivative): High value (4.09354361).
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl**: Moderate-high value (2.39065878).
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1**: Low-positive value (0.15313096).
   - **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1**: Very low-positive value (0.02022094).
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br**: Negative value (-0.71739225).

   Halogenation (Cl, Br) tends to increase the property value compared to non-halogenated analogs, but the effect depends on the number of halogens and molecular size. Smaller halogenated molecules (e.g., FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br) can have negative values.

2. **Brominated vs. Chlorinated**:
   - Bromine seems to contribute less to the property value than chlorine in similar contexts (compare Br-substituted aromatics vs. Cl-substituted aromatics).

3. **Small Aliphatic Halogenated Molecules**:
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (small, polyhalogenated aliphatic): Negative value (-0.71739225).
   - **BrC(Br)Br** is even simpler (no fluorines or chlorines, just bromines), so it might have a lower value than FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br.

4. **Symmetry and Size**:
   - Tribromomethane is a small, symmetric molecule with no aromaticity or extended conjugation, which typically correlates with lower (often negative) values in the dataset.

### Prediction for BrC(Br)Br:
Given the small size, lack of aromaticity, and presence of three bromines (less impactful than chlorines), the property value is likely **negative** and moderately low, similar to or slightly higher than FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br (-0.71739225). 

However, since Br is less electronegative than Cl/F, the value might be less negative. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.45** (range: -0.5 to -0.4).

### Final Answer:
**-0.45** (approximate, based on trends in the dataset).

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 6.490011552607804
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: Present in **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 5.98725652). This group tends to increase the property value significantly when combined with aromatic and polar substituents.
2. **Aromatic rings (c1ccccc1)**: Present in many examples, with varying contributions depending on substituents. Here, it's part of a lactam (C(=O)N2...C2=O), which adds polarity.
3. **Chlorine (Cl)**: Present in **C(CCl)**, which is moderately electronegative but less impactful than multiple halogens.
4. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**: Present twice, similar to the **OCC** in **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)...**, contributing to hydrophilicity.
5. **Lactam (N2C(=O)...C2=O)**: Polar and rigid, similar to the lactam in **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)...NC3=O** (property = 3.37427181).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule resembles **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (5.98725652) but has a less complex aromatic system and fewer halogens.
- It also shares features with **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)...NC3=O** (3.37427181), but with additional phosphorothioate and ethoxy groups.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the phosphorothioate (high contribution) and simpler aromatic/lactam system (moderate contribution), the predicted value is slightly lower than **5.98725652** but higher than **3.37427181**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 4.85** (approximate, based on structural interpolation). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend of increasing values with complex polar/aromatic systems and phosphorus/halogen substituents.)

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 4.4252100690584095
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Amide group**: `C(=O)N` (seen in molecules like `CN(C)C(=O)C` with property -0.7220112 and `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` with -0.54292225).
   - **Aromatic ring with chlorine substitution**: `c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)` (similar to `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` with 0.80838096, but this has two rings; `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has -0.39476246).
   - **Heterocyclic fragment**: `n2nc(oc2=O)` (oxadiazole-like, similar to `Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23` with 0.23124638).
   - **Bulky tert-butyl group**: `C(C)(C)C` (similar to `CCOc1ccc(cc1)C(C)(C)COCc3cccc(Oc2ccccc2)c3` with 13.48817709, but this is a much larger molecule).

2. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is moderately large with polar groups (amide, chlorine, heterocycle) and a bulky tert-butyl group. This suggests intermediate polarity and potential for higher property values compared to small aliphatic molecules.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The closest analogs are molecules with amides, aromatic chlorine, and heterocycles. For example:
     - `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` has a property of -0.54292225 (smaller, less complex).
     - `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has -0.39476246 (simpler aromatic chlorine).
     - `Cc1cc(no1)C(=O)NNCc2ccccc2` has 0.8153607 (similar complexity with heterocycle and amide).
     - `CC(=O)N(N(C1=O)c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` has 5.05699157 (larger, more conjugated).

### Prediction:
Given the structural complexity (amide, aromatic chlorine, heterocycle, bulky group), the property value is likely in the **positive intermediate range**, similar to molecules like `Cc1cc(no1)C(=O)NNCc2ccccc2` (0.8153607) but slightly higher due to the additional chlorine and tert-butyl group. 

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.25** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the examples). 

This balances the contributions from the polar amide/heterocycle (+ effect) and the bulky/chlorine substituents (+ effect), while noting that larger conjugated systems in the examples reach higher values (e.g., 5.05699157). The absence of extensive conjugation or multiple aromatic rings keeps the value modest.

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 1.509804526024919
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms (e.g., **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2**, property = 0.80838096) tend to have higher property values compared to those with fewer chlorines. 
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (4 chlorines) has a property of -0.01720779, but this is likely offset by the presence of hydroxyl groups.

2. **Hydroxyl Groups (-OH)**:
   - Molecules with -OH groups (e.g., **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**, property = -0.39413507) tend to lower the property value, especially when combined with chlorines.

3. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Aromatic rings with substitutions (e.g., **c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2**, property = 0.45555388) can increase the property value, especially with halogens.

4. **Symmetry and Multiple Substitutions**:
   - The given molecule has two aromatic rings linked by an oxygen bridge (**Oc1...Oc2...**), with three chlorine substitutions (two on one ring, one on the other) and two hydroxyl groups. This is somewhat similar to **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (property = -0.39413507) but with an additional aromatic ring and chlorine.

### Prediction:
The molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** has:
- Two hydroxyl groups (reducing effect).
- Three chlorine atoms (increasing effect).
- An extended conjugated system (slight increasing effect).

Given the balance between the reducing effect of -OH and the increasing effect of Cl and aromaticity, the property value is likely slightly higher than **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (-0.39413507) but lower than **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2** (0.80838096). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.25**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. The value could be refined with more examples or context.) 

---
**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value for **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** is approximately **0.25**.

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.7085354940042888
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property value appears to correlate with molecular size, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule `CC/C=C\C` is a simple alkene (2-pentene, specifically), similar to `CC/C=C/C` (which is also 2-pentene, but with a different stereochemistry), which has a property value of `-0.70853549`. 

Since `CC/C=C\C` is structurally very similar (same molecular formula and functional groups, just a different stereochemistry around the double bond), its property value should be very close to that of `CC/C=C/C`. 

Thus, the predicted property value for `CC/C=C\C` is approximately:  
**`-0.708`** (rounded to 3 decimal places for consistency with the given examples). 

(Note: The slight difference in stereochemistry is unlikely to significantly affect the property value in this context, as the examples do not show strong stereochemical dependence for such small alkenes.)

Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.6763554309557471
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Ethers**:
   - **C** (methane): -0.95210005  
   - **CC#C** (propyne): -0.86965076  
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): -0.80751915  
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): -0.83265345  
   - **CC(C)Cl** (isopropyl chloride): -0.77908442  
   - **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol): -0.68020545  
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cycloheptane): -0.55409199  
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (methoxyphenol): -0.49395664  

   These molecules have property values in the negative range, typically between -0.95 and -0.45. The presence of oxygen (in ethers or alcohols) tends to slightly increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons but still keeps it negative.

2. **Ethers**:
   - **CCOC(=O)C** (ethyl acetate): -0.57457121  
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate): -0.25116819  

   Ethers and esters with simple alkyl groups tend to have property values in the moderate negative range. The more complex the ester/ether, the less negative the value (e.g., ethyl benzoate is -0.25).

3. **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether):
   - This is a simple ether with two ethyl groups. It lacks strongly polar or functionalized groups (like carbonyls or halogens) that would push the property value toward positive territory.
   - Compared to **CC(C)O** (isopropanol, -0.83) and **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol, -0.68), diethyl ether is less polar than alcohols but more polar than pure hydrocarbons. Its value should be slightly higher (less negative) than propane (-0.87) but lower than ethyl acetate (-0.57).

### Prediction:
Given the trends, **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether) should have a property value in the range of **-0.6 to -0.7**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.65**  

This aligns with the slightly less negative values observed for ethers compared to pure hydrocarbons or alcohols.

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 3.3153202903363153
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group contributions (e.g., aromatic rings, carbonyl groups, halogens, etc.). The molecule to predict is:

**CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: Two phenyl rings (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`) contribute positively to the property (e.g., compare `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` with a value of **0.68771563**).
2. **Tertiary Amide Group**: `N(C(=O)N...)` is polar and likely increases the property (similar to amides in other examples, e.g., `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` with **3.70233014**).
3. **Tert-Butyl Group**: `C(C)(C)` is bulky but non-polar, which may slightly reduce the property compared to a simpler alkyl group.
4. **No Halogens or Highly Polar Groups**: Absence of groups like `NO2`, `Br`, or `SO2` (which can significantly affect the property in either direction).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` (value: **3.70233014**) has an additional heterocyclic ring (`s1`) and ether linkage (`O`), which likely increase its property. The target molecule lacks these but retains the diphenyl and amide features.
- `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (value: **0.68771563**) has two phenyl rings but no polar amide group, so the target molecule should be higher due to the amide.
- `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23` (value: **0.89983151**) has a less polar/polarizable structure than the target molecule but still includes an amide and aromatic-like rigidity.

### Predicted Property:
The target molecule has two phenyl rings and a polar tertiary amide, placing it between the simpler diphenyl (**0.687**) and the more complex heterocyclic amide (**3.702**). A reasonable estimate is **~1.8–2.5**, leaning toward the higher end due to the amide's polarity and aromatic stacking potential.

**Final Prediction: 2.1** (specific value within the expected range based on structural analogs).

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.003553663077437797
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property. Here's my reasoning:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a substituted benzene ring (**c1ccc(Br)cc1**) with an acetamido group (**CC(=O)N-**) attached. This is similar to molecules like:
   - **Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (property: -0.52456901)
   - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property: -0.46239098)
   - **Cc1ccc(N)cc1** (property: -0.4684215)
   - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1** (property: -0.44373403)
   - **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** (property: -0.50881932)

2. **Substituents**:
   - The **Br** substituent is present in some of the above examples and tends to contribute slightly negatively to the property (e.g., -0.462 for **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**).
   - The **CC(=O)N-** group is a polar amide, which is more electron-withdrawing than simple alkyl or halogen substituents but less polar than nitro or sulfonyl groups. Compare to:
     - **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property: 3.31532029), but this has two aromatic rings and a bulky substituent, so it's not directly comparable.
     - Simpler amides or polar groups in the examples tend to have property values in the range of -0.5 to 0.5.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - The closest analog is **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property: -0.46239098), where the **OH** group is replaced by **CC(=O)N-**. The amide group is more polar and bulky than **OH**, but not as extreme as nitro or sulfonyl groups.
   - The presence of **Br** and the amide group suggests the property will be slightly higher (less negative) than **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** but still in the negative to near-zero range.

### Estimated Property:
Given the above, the property for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is likely in the range of **-0.3 to 0.1**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property: -0.25**  

This is based on:
- The **Br** substituent contributing ~-0.45 (as in **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**).
- The **CC(=O)N-** group being less negative than **OH** but still polar, pulling the value slightly upward (less negative) compared to **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.25**
==================================================
Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.15237322371852605
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns in the property values based on molecular structure.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple alkylbenzenes** (e.g., toluene, ethylbenzene, propylbenzene):
   - **Cc1ccccc1 (toluene)**: Not explicitly listed, but similar to **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (-0.31572026) and **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (0.00749277).
   - **CCc1ccccc1 (ethylbenzene)**: Not listed, but **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (para-ethyltoluene) is -0.31572026.
   - **CCCCc1ccccc1 (butylbenzene)**: Not listed, but longer alkyl chains tend to decrease the property slightly (e.g., **CCCCCCC#C** is -0.41041943).

2. **Branched alkylbenzenes**:
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene): -0.1409037.
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutyl alcohol): -0.76403753 (not aromatic, but shows branching effect).

3. **Aromatic systems with alkyl substitutions**:
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): -0.44168361.
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1** (phenylacetonitrile): -0.58198472.
   - **Brc1ccccc1** (bromobenzene): -0.50771341.

4. **General trend**:
   - Simple alkylbenzenes (no polar groups) have property values in the range of **-0.3 to -0.6**.
   - Branching tends to lower the property slightly compared to linear chains (e.g., **CC(C)CCO** is -0.68114771 vs. **CCCC(C)O** is -0.68020545).
   - The presence of a benzene ring with a small alkyl group (e.g., isobutyl) would likely place the property in the **-0.3 to -0.5** range.

### Prediction for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1:
- This is isobutylbenzene, a branched alkylbenzene. 
- Compared to **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (-0.31572026, ethyltoluene), the branching (isobutyl instead of ethyl) may slightly lower the property.
- Compared to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (-0.1409037, isopropyltoluene), the absence of a second methyl on the ring may lower the property slightly.

Given these comparisons, a reasonable estimate is:
**Predicted property value: -0.35** (between -0.3 and -0.4, closer to ethylbenzene-like systems). 

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (-0.31572026) and **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (-0.1409037), the isobutyl group (CC(C)C-) is bulkier than ethyl but less bulky than isopropyl + methyl. Thus, the value should be between these two, likely closer to the ethyl case. 

Final prediction: **-0.30**. 

However, since **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** is -0.315 and **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** is -0.140, the unsubstituted isobutylbenzene (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1) would likely be slightly lower than -0.315 due to less ring substitution. 

Thus, the most precise estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.38**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.5659957127655547
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Polar Substituents**:
   - **COc1ccccc1** (anisole): -0.53730134  
     (Methoxy group on benzene)
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (paracetamol-like): -0.43902701  
     (Amide and hydroxyl on benzene)
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): -0.34255893  
     (Strongly electron-withdrawing nitro groups)

   These show that polar substituents on benzene rings tend to give negative property values, with electron-withdrawing groups reducing the magnitude slightly.

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - **Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1** (thiazole with carbonyl): -0.5592095  
   - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (unsaturated ketone): -0.09805893  
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (imide with two phenyls): 1.58259656  

   Carbonyl groups alone (especially in aliphatic contexts) seem to reduce the property value, but when combined with aromatic systems or multiple carbonyls, the effect varies.

3. **Benzaldehyde-like Structures**:
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** has a single aldehyde group directly attached to benzene. This is simpler than most examples, but closest to:
     - **COc1ccccc1** (methoxybenzene): -0.53730134  
     (Aldehyde is more electron-withdrawing than methoxy, likely reducing the magnitude slightly.)
     - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O**: -0.43902701  
       (More polar than benzaldehyde, but similar benzene + carbonyl motif.)

### Prediction:
The aldehyde group in **O=Cc1ccccc1** is electron-withdrawing and polar, similar to the methoxy group in **COc1ccccc1** but slightly less polar than the amide/hydroxyl in **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O**. Given the trend, I expect the property value to be slightly less negative than anisole but more negative than dinitrobenzene.

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.48** (between -0.537 and -0.439, closer to the former due to simpler substitution).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **O=Cc1ccccc1** is **-0.48**.

Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.23643821418532576
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Presence of Nitro Groups (NO2)**: 
   - Molecules with nitro groups tend to have higher property values (e.g., `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` has a value of **1.50766818**).
   - The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group and often increases the property value.

2. **Heterocyclic or Complex Ring Systems**:
   - Molecules with fused or complex ring systems (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3c4ccccc4ccc23` has a value of **2.6845579**) tend to have higher values.
   - The presence of multiple functional groups or conjugated systems also increases the value.

3. **Amide or Urea-like Structures**:
   - Molecules with amide/urea-like linkages (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has a value of **3.31532029**) tend to have high values due to polarity and hydrogen bonding potential.

4. **Simple Aliphatic or Halogenated Compounds**:
   - Small, non-polar, or halogenated molecules (e.g., `ClC(Br)Br` has a value of **-0.6620825**) tend to have low or negative values.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The given molecule has the following features:
- A **fused heterocyclic system** (imidazolidine-2,4-dione core, similar to hydantoin).
- A **nitro group (N(=O)=O)** attached to an aromatic ring, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group.
- An **aromatic ring (c1ccc(o1))** conjugated with the nitro group.
- **Two amide (C=O) groups** in the heterocycle, contributing to polarity and hydrogen bonding.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
1. The molecule resembles `CN(C(=O)N(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (value = **3.31532029**) due to the amide groups and aromaticity but is slightly less complex.
2. The nitro group's presence is similar to `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` (value = **1.50766818**), but the target molecule has more polar groups.
3. The fused heterocycle is less extended than some high-value examples but still significant.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nitro group, the polar amide functionalities, and the conjugated aromatic system, the property value is expected to be **moderately high**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: ~2.5**  
(Specifically, **2.45 - 2.70** range, likely closer to **2.6** based on the examples.)

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 2.6**
==================================================
Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.6759134648813833
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **-0.58904397**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (a diazo compound linking two phenyl rings) has a property value of **0.46656261**.
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to the diazo compound but with a **hydrazine bridge (-NH-NH-)** instead of a diazo (-N=N-) group. Hydrazine linkages are less electron-withdrawing than diazo groups, so the property value should be lower than 0.46656261 but higher than -0.58904397 (since the second phenyl ring adds some bulk/polarizability).

2. **Comparison to Other Nitrogen-Containing Aromatics**:
   - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a carbazole-like structure) has a high value of **3.40858754**, but this is due to its extended conjugated system.
   - The molecule in question lacks such extended conjugation, so its value should be much lower.

3. **Effect of Symmetry and Substitution**:
   - The molecule is symmetric with two phenyl rings attached to a central hydrazine group. Symmetric molecules with moderate polarity often have property values in the low positive or near-zero range.

### Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is likely slightly positive but lower than the diazo analogue. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.25**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the provided data. For precise predictions, computational or experimental methods would be required.)

Iteration: 50
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -0.2444643773292408
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure (cyclohexane-like ring, **CCCC1**). 
   - It is a bicyclic system with two fused rings: a cyclohexane and a diketopiperazine-like ring (formed by the two amides).

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The amide groups are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding, which typically increases the property value (e.g., solubility or some other measured property in the examples). 
   - The cyclohexane ring adds hydrophobicity, but the amides dominate the polarity.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = -0.00833625): This is a similar diketopiperazine derivative but with smaller substituents (ethyl groups). The property is close to zero.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = 0.56013958): This has a larger hydrophobic component (more alkyl groups) but a similar core structure. The property is slightly positive.
   - **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(O)CCC12C)C3CCC4=O** (property = 3.29718102): This is a steroid-like molecule with a ketone and hydroxyl groups, showing higher values for larger, more complex structures with polar groups.

4. **Size and Complexity**:
   - The given molecule is smaller than the steroid-like example but larger than the simple diketopiperazine. It has moderate complexity with two fused rings and two amides.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between polarity (from amides) and hydrophobicity (from cyclohexane), and comparing to similar structures, the property value is likely in the **low to moderate positive range**. A reasonable estimate would be close to the diketopiperazine derivative with alkyl chains (0.56013958), but slightly higher due to the fused ring system.

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.25** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 1.2370538238175135
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a **biphenyl system** (two benzene rings connected by a single bond) with **chlorine substitutions**.
   - The first ring has one chlorine at the para position: `Clc1ccc(cc1)`.
   - The second ring has two chlorines at the meta and para positions: `c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`.
   - This is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-like structure**, which is highly hydrophobic and heavy.

2. **Similar Examples from the Given Data**:
   - `Clc1ccccc1Cl` (dichlorobenzene): **-0.44373403**
   - `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (hexachloroethane-like with biphenyl): **3.71564671**
   - `C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13` (polyaromatic hydrocarbon): **1.7891602**

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of **multiple chlorines** increases the property value significantly (e.g., compare `Clc1ccccc1Cl` to `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`).
   - **Biphenyl systems** with halogens tend to have higher values than simple halogenated benzenes.
   - The given molecule has **three chlorines**, which is fewer than the hexachloroethane-like example (property = 3.715) but more than the dichlorobenzene example (property = -0.443).

4. **Property Trend**:
   - More chlorines → higher property value.
   - Larger conjugated systems (e.g., biphenyl) → higher property value.
   - The molecule is **less chlorinated than the hexachloroethane-like example but more than dichlorobenzene**, so the value should lie between these two.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (3.715) but with fewer chlorines, and considering the biphenyl core, a reasonable estimate is slightly lower than 3.715 but still significantly higher than simple dichlorobenzene. 

**Predicted property value: ~2.8 to 3.2**

However, looking at the given examples more carefully:
- The **hexachloroethane-like biphenyl** (3.715) has **6 chlorines**, while our molecule has **3 chlorines**.
- The **dichlorobenzene** (-0.443) has **2 chlorines**.
- The **polyaromatic hydrocarbon (no halogens)** has a value of **1.789**.

Since our molecule is **intermediate in halogenation** but still heavily conjugated, a value closer to **2.5** seems plausible. 

But given that the **hexachloroethane-like biphenyl** is **3.715**, and our molecule is **less chlorinated but still a biphenyl**, a value around **2.8** is reasonable.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 2.9** (approximate, likely between 2.8 and 3.2 based on the given examples). 

Given the data, I would refine this to **~2.9**.

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.14374246343703334
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural and functional group trends that correlate with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains (Alkanes/Alkenes/Arenes):**
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): **0.29780306**
   - **CCCCCCCC=C** (oct-1-ene): **-0.2075176**
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (tetradecanol): **1.35823813**
   - **C=CC=O** (acrolein): **-0.84734991**
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde): **-0.56599571**
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (toluidine): **-0.4684215**

   Hydrocarbons with simple alkyl/aryl groups tend to have property values close to zero, with slight variations based on chain length or branching. Aromatic rings with small substituents (e.g., methyl, ethyl) typically fall in the range of **-0.5 to 0.5**.

2. **Diethylbenzene (CCc1ccc(CC)cc1):**
   - This is a dialkyl-substituted benzene with two ethyl groups. It lacks polar functional groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -C=O) that significantly alter the property value in other examples.
   - Compared to **hexylbenzene (0.2978)**, which has a longer alkyl chain, diethylbenzene would likely have a slightly lower value due to shorter chains and less hydrophobic contribution.
   - Compared to **toluidine (-0.4684)**, which has a polar -NH2 group, diethylbenzene would be less negative because it lacks polar effects.

3. **Similar Structures:**
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene) is not in the examples, but **Cc1ccccc1N** (toluidine) is at **-0.4684**. Removing the polar -NH2 group would increase the value closer to zero.
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene) at **0.2978** suggests that longer alkyl chains increase the value slightly.

### Prediction:
Diethylbenzene has two ethyl groups (less hydrophobic than hexyl) and no polar groups. Its value should be:
- Slightly lower than hexylbenzene (**0.2978**) but higher than toluene-like structures with polar groups (e.g., **-0.4684** for toluidine).
- A reasonable estimate is **~0.1 to 0.2**.

Given the examples, I predict the property value for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** to be:  
**0.175** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures).  

*Note: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an educated guess based on the trend of increasing value with alkyl chain length and decreasing polarity.*

Iteration: 53
SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -0.25735529785569206
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitrogen-containing aromatic rings** (e.g., aniline derivatives, nitro groups, sulfonamides):
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (nitroaniline) has a property value of **-0.41292253**.
   - **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12** (purine-like structure) has a value of **-0.45421165**.
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is a sulfonamide derivative of aniline, which is structurally similar to nitroaniline but with a sulfonamide group (**S(N)(=O)=O**) instead of a nitro group.

2. **Sulfonamide groups**:
   - Sulfonamides are polar and can influence the property value similarly to nitro groups but may have slightly different effects due to differences in electronegativity and sterics.
   - The sulfonamide group in **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is bulkier and more polar than a nitro group, which could moderately increase the property value compared to nitroaniline.

3. **Other substituents**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (like **NO₂** or **SO₂NH₂**) tend to decrease the property value when attached to aromatic rings, but the exact impact depends on the specific group.

### Comparison:
- **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: -0.41292253 (nitro group)
- **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**: The sulfonamide group is less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group but still polar. We might expect a slightly higher (less negative) value than nitroaniline but still negative.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarities to nitroaniline and the slightly less electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonamide group, a reasonable prediction for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is:

**-0.35** (approximately between -0.4 and -0.3, accounting for the sulfonamide's effect). 

However, looking at the examples more closely, sulfonamides or similar structures (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** with a value of 1.22356955) suggest that sulfonamide-like groups can sometimes increase the property value. But in this case, the aniline sulfonamide is likely closer to nitroaniline, so a slight adjustment upward from -0.41292253 seems plausible.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.30** (rounded estimate based on structural analogy and trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 1.3795052979385958
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings. It resembles a **tetracene-like structure** (though not linear; it's more angular or "kinked"). 

Key observations:
1. **Aromaticity**: The molecule is fully conjugated and aromatic, similar to other PAHs in the dataset (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene, or phenanthrene derivatives).
2. **Size/Complexity**: It has 4 fused rings, which is larger than naphthalene (2 rings) but smaller than some of the highly chlorinated or substituted PAHs in the dataset.
3. **Substituents**: No heteroatoms or functional groups are present (just pure hydrocarbon), which typically lowers the property value compared to halogenated or polar-substituted analogs.

### Comparison to Examples:
- **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (property = 3.46691578): This is a 4-ring PAH with a methyl group. The property is high due to the extended conjugation and aromaticity.
- **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (property = 3.87968159): A 5-ring PAH (larger than our target), giving a higher value.
- **Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32** (property = 1.17047034): A 3-ring PAH with a methyl group, smaller than our target.
- **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 5.22841435): A heavily chlorinated biphenyl, which drastically increases the property due to halogens.

Our molecule is a **4-ring PAH without substituents**, so its property should be:
- Higher than smaller PAHs (e.g., naphthalene-like structures with values ~1-2).
- Lower than heavily substituted or larger PAHs (e.g., the 5-ring example at 3.87 or chlorinated examples >5).
- Similar to other 4-ring PAHs in the dataset (e.g., the methyl-substituted one at 3.466).

### Prediction:
Given the lack of substituents and intermediate size, a reasonable estimate is **~3.0 to 3.5**. Splitting the difference, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 3.2** (approximate; likely between 3.0 and 3.5 based on the dataset trend). 

For specificity, I'll assign **3.25** as a balanced estimate. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, polarizability, etc.—this is based on the trend that larger, more conjugated/aromatic systems have higher values in the given data.)

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 1.75121441163798
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and hydrogen bonding. The molecule in question is:

**Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**

### Key structural features:
1. **Multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)**: These contribute to hydrogen bonding and polarity, which may increase the property value.
2. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains fused and connected aromatic rings, which are common in many of the higher-valued examples.
3. **Ether linkage (Oc)**: Present in some of the higher-valued examples.
4. **Carbonyl group (C=O)**: Present in some mid-to-high-valued examples.
5. **Extended conjugation**: The molecule has significant π-conjugation due to the fused and linked aromatic systems, which is associated with higher property values in the examples.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**: Property = 4.11179531  
  This has aromatic rings, halogenation, and polar groups, similar to our molecule (though ours has more hydroxyl groups and no halogens).
- **Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4**: Property = 4.30385376  
  This has aromatic rings, ether linkage, carbonyl, and hydroxyl groups, very similar to our molecule.
- **OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5**: Property = 42.95692101  
  This is much larger and has a bromine atom, but shares some features like hydroxyl groups and aromatic systems.

### Prediction:
Our molecule has:
- More hydroxyl groups than the first two examples (increasing polarity/H-bonding).
- No halogens (unlike the first two examples, which might reduce the value slightly compared to halogenated analogs).
- Similar conjugation and carbonyl/ether features as the second example (property ~4.3).

Given these observations, the property value is likely in the **mid-to-high range**, similar to the second example but slightly higher due to additional hydroxyl groups. 

### Final predicted property value:
**4.5** (rounded from an estimated range of 4.3–4.7 based on the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, bioactivity—this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data.)

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: -0.2674180377831445
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends in the property values based on molecular features:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Simple alkanes (e.g., CCCCC)**: Low property values (e.g., -0.70678883 for CCCCC).
2. **Polar or functionalized alkanes (e.g., CCCCBr, CCCCO)**: Slightly higher but still negative (e.g., -0.63693101 for CCCCBr).
3. **Aromatic rings with simple substituents (e.g., Cc1cccc(C)c1)**: Negative values (e.g., -0.45931439).
4. **Nitro groups (e.g., Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O)**: Moderately negative (e.g., -0.40311083).
5. **Phosphorothioate/phosphoryl groups (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl)**: High positive values (e.g., 1.58955584).
6. **Complex phosphoryl/thiophosphoryl structures with multiple halogens or bulky groups**: Very high values (e.g., 5.82737136 for CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C).
7. **Molecules with multiple electronegative atoms (e.g., Cl, O, S, P)**: Tend to have higher property values.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** has:
- A **phosphoryl group (P=O)**.
- A **thioester (SC)**.
- An **amide linkage (NC(C)=O)**.
- An **ethoxy group (CO)**.

This structure resembles phosphoryl/thiophosphoryl compounds in the examples, which have high property values. The presence of P=O, S, and N=O contributes to polarity and likely increases the property value.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: 1.58955584 (phosphorothioate with aromatic Cl substituents).
- **COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: 2.54448056 (phosphoryl with Cl substituents).
- **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**: 5.82737136 (complex thiophosphoryl with amide).

The target molecule lacks aromatic Cl substituents but has a thioester and amide, which are electronegative. It is less complex than the highest examples but more complex than simple phosphoryl compounds.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, the property value for **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** is likely in the range of **1.5 to 2.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 1.85** (interpolating between similar phosphoryl/thioester examples). 

This balances the contributions of P=O, S, and N=O without overestimating due to lack of aromatic/Cl substituents.

Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.7813383733921172
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes**: 
   - **CC1CCCC1** (cyclohexane): -0.659  
   - **CCCC(C)C** (branched alkane): -0.614  
   - **CC(=C)C** (branched alkene): -0.615  
   These suggest that simple hydrocarbons (alkanes/alkenes) tend to have property values around **-0.6 to -0.7**.

2. **Chlorinated Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): 3.159  
     Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds have high positive values (~3.16).  
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (dichlorophenol): -0.394  
     Less chlorinated aromatics have slightly negative values.  
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (chloroaniline): -0.461  
     Chlorine on an aromatic ring with polar groups reduces the value further.  

3. **Small Chlorinated Alkenes/Alkanes**:
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane): -0.802  
     Simple halogenated alkanes have very negative values.  
   - **CCCBr** (bromopropane): -0.637  
     Longer chains slightly increase the value.  
   - **Cl\C=C/Cl** is a small, symmetrical chlorinated alkene, similar in simplicity to **CCBr** or **CCCBr**, but with double-bond rigidity and two chlorines.

### Prediction for **Cl\C=C/Cl**:
- The molecule is a small, non-aromatic chlorinated alkene.  
- Compared to **CCBr** (-0.802) and **CCCBr** (-0.637), the presence of two chlorines and a double bond might slightly increase the value (less negative) due to increased polarity, but it lacks complex features (e.g., rings, aromatics, or multiple functional groups) that drive the property to positive values.  
- A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.6 and -0.7**, similar to simple halogenated alkanes but slightly higher due to the double bond.  

### Final Prediction:
**-0.65** (close to simple cycloalkanes and halogenated alkanes).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend of smaller/less complex molecules having more negative values.)*

Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.7243663347630196
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends:

### Observations:
1. **Aromaticity and Heteroatoms**:
   - Simple aromatic rings with heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen) tend to have property values in the range of **-0.5 to 0.5** unless they have additional functional groups or complexity.
   - Example: **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline) has a value of **-0.457**, while **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (a more complex fused heteroaromatic) has a value of **0.466**.

2. **Pyridine (c1ccncc1)**:
   - Pyridine is a simple 6-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen. It lacks additional functional groups or extended conjugation.
   - Compared to **CNc1ccccc1** (-0.457), pyridine is simpler (no methyl group) but has a nitrogen directly in the ring, which may slightly increase the property value.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43** (a large polycyclic aromatic) has a high value (**4.240**) due to extensive conjugation.
   - **c1ccncc1** is much simpler, so its value should be closer to small aromatic systems like benzene derivatives.

### Prediction:
Given the simplicity of pyridine and its similarity to other small aromatic molecules with property values around **-0.4 to 0.0**, the predicted value for **c1ccncc1** is likely slightly higher than benzene derivatives due to the nitrogen's electronegativity but still in the lower range.

**Predicted property value: -0.25**  
*(This is an educated estimate based on the examples, likely between -0.3 and -0.2.)*

Iteration: 59
SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 7.531853275614549
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Ether and alcohol groups (OCC(O)CO-)**: These are polar and hydrophilic, often associated with negative or modest property values (e.g., OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO has -0.39191674).
   - **Ester linkage (COC(=O))**: Esters can slightly increase the property value (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC has 0.55185382).
   - **Aromatic ring with amide-like nitrogen (Nc2ccnc3...)**: The presence of nitrogen in an aromatic system (e.g., pyridine-like) and aniline-like (Nc2...) can increase the property value (e.g., N-containing aromatics like c1ccc2cnccc2c1 have -0.27467748, but more complex N systems like O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 have 1.11029893).
   - **Chlorine substitution (Cl)**: Chlorine tends to decrease the property value modestly (e.g., Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has -0.18459322).
   - **Extended conjugated system**: The molecule has a large conjugated system (aromatic rings + N incorporation), which often increases the property value (e.g., polycyclic aromatics like c1cc2ccc3cccc4ccc(c1)c2c34 have 1.56197276).

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The molecule is most similar to **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** (1.11029893), which has two aromatic rings linked by an amide-like nitrogen. Here, the property value is elevated due to the conjugated system and N participation.
   - The additional ester group (COC(=O)) and chlorine substitution may slightly offset the increase from the conjugated system, but the overall impact is likely still positive.
   - The presence of **OCC(O)CO-** (polar/alcoholic) may slightly reduce the value, but the dominant effect comes from the aromatic/N system.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above, the molecule's property value is likely **between 1.0 and 1.5**, closer to the higher end due to the extended conjugation and nitrogen incorporation. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 1.25**  

This balances the positive contributions from the aromatic/N system and the modest reductions from polar/alcoholic and Cl substituents.

Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.6797729905196904
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): -0.31976857  
   - **CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1** (tert-butylbenzene): 0.05073881  
   - **CCCCCCCI** (heptyl iodide): -0.03973242  
   - **C1CCC2CCCCC2C1** (decalin): -0.19438944  
   Hydrocarbon chains or aliphatic rings tend to have negative or near-zero values unless functionalized.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **COC=O** (methyl formate): -0.88678671  
   - **CCOC=O** (ethyl formate): -0.82802315  
   Simple esters have negative values.  
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol): -0.3879887  
   Alcohols with aliphatic rings have moderately negative values.  
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tert-amyl alcohol): -0.46390755  
   Branched alcohols also have negative values.

3. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - The presence of **-OH** (alcohol) groups tends to reduce the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons but not as drastically as highly polar or charged groups.  
   - **CCCCCO** is a linear alcohol (1-pentanol), which is more polar than pure hydrocarbons but less polar than multifunctional or aromatic alcohols.

4. **Trend for Linear Alcohols**:
   - The property value seems to decrease with increasing chain length for alcohols (comparing **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** and **OC1CCCCCCC1**).  
   - **CCCCCO** is a 5-carbon alcohol, intermediate in chain length.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Linear/branched alcohols have values between **-0.3 to -0.5**.  
- Longer chains (like **OC1CCCCCCC1**) approach **-0.38**.  
- Less polar hydrocarbons are closer to zero.  

For **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I predict a value slightly less negative than **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol) because it is linear (less steric hindrance) but has a shorter chain.  

### Final Prediction:
**Property value for CCCCO: -0.35**  

*(This is an educated estimate based on the trend of alcohols in the given data.)*

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 1.2944570407007114
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic ring (c2ccccc2)**: Present in many examples, often associated with moderate property values (e.g., -0.073 to 1.98). The presence of an attached amide group (C(=O)N) may slightly increase the value.
2. **Sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O))**: This is a polar, electron-withdrawing group. In the examples, sulfonyl/sulfoxide groups appear in molecules with higher property values (e.g., 1.683 in **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**).
3. **Lactone-like structure (CCO1)**: Cyclic esters or similar structures (e.g., in **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(O)CCC12C)C3CCC4=O**) tend to have higher property values (3.297 in this case).
4. **Heterocycle (CC1=C...O1)**: The fused ring system with sulfur and oxygen may contribute to a higher value due to increased polarity and complexity.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C**: Property = 5.19. This has a phosphorothioate group, aromatic ring, and ester, similar in complexity/polarity to the given molecule.
- **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3**: Property = 1.58. This has two aromatic rings and a cyclic imide, somewhat simpler but structurally analogous.
- **CC(C)OC(=O)C(O)(c1ccc(Br)cc1)c2ccc(Br)cc2**: Property = 5.37. This has two aromatic rings and bulky polar groups, similar to the given molecule's sulfonyl and amide.

### Predicted Property:
Given the combination of an aromatic ring, sulfonyl group, and heterocyclic lactone-like structure, the property value is likely in the **moderate-to-high range**, similar to the examples above. 

**Predicted value: 4.50** (approximate, based on structural similarity to examples with values ~4-5). 

### Rationale:
- The sulfonyl group and fused ring system increase polarity and complexity, pushing the value higher than simpler aromatics (e.g., 1.58 for the cyclic imide example).
- It lacks extremely high-contributing features like multiple halogens (e.g., Cl clusters giving ~4-5) or large conjugated systems (e.g., 50.34 in the extreme case), so it should not exceed ~5.
- The amide and sulfonyl groups are less extreme than phosphorothioates or polyhalogenation, so the value is likely below 5.19 but above 1.58.

Thus, **4.50** is a reasonable estimate.

Iteration: 62
SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 4.401142949484712
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic system with nitro group**: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`), which is present in some of the examples (e.g., `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` with a property value of `-0.40311083`). Nitro groups tend to increase the property value when combined with other polar or conjugated systems.
2. **Ester groups (`C(=O)OC`)**: There are two ester groups, which are polar and can contribute to higher property values. For example, `CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC` (with two ester groups) has a very high value of `13.78077329`, though this is an extreme case due to its large size.
3. **Heterocyclic nitrogen**: The molecule includes a nitrogen in a ring (`NC(=C)`), similar to some examples like `CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O` (property value `1.55429449`). Nitrogen-containing heterocycles often increase the property value.
4. **Conjugation**: The system is highly conjugated (alternating single and double bonds across the structure), which can increase the property value due to delocalization effects. For example, polycyclic aromatic systems like `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` have very high values (`9.47738117`).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The presence of nitro + ester + heterocyclic nitrogen + conjugation suggests a higher property value, likely in the range of **2.0 to 5.0** based on similar examples.
- The molecule is smaller than `CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC` (value `13.78`), so it won't be that high.
- It is more complex than `CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O` (value `1.554`), so it should be higher than that.

### Predicted value:
Considering the above, a reasonable prediction is **3.5**. This accounts for the combined effects of the nitro group, esters, heterocyclic nitrogen, and conjugation.

### Final answer:
**Predicted property value: 3.5** (estimated range: 3.0 to 4.0).

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.528307682407203
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). It is a cyclic diamide (imide) structure, which is relatively polar and rigid.
2. **Polarity**: The presence of multiple carbonyl groups (C=O) and nitrogen atoms suggests moderate to high polarity.
3. **Size and Complexity**: It is a small bicyclic system (5- and 3-membered rings fused together), similar in size to some of the smaller aromatic or aliphatic examples in the dataset.

### Comparison to Examples:
- Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., amides, carbonyls) or fused rings tend to have higher property values (e.g., **2.29571263** for **ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, which also has amides and aromatic rings).
- Small rigid systems like **c1ccncc1** (pyridine) have a value of **-0.72436633**, but this lacks the polarity of the imide.
- The imide group here is more polar than simple aromatics but less complex than large polycyclic systems (e.g., steroids or polyaromatics with very high values).

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of polarity and rigidity, but small size, a reasonable estimate would be in the range of **1.5 to 2.5**. A plausible specific value based on the examples is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.876**  

This aligns with the trend where small but highly polar/rigid structures (e.g., imides, cyclic amides) have values significantly higher than simple hydrocarbons but lower than large polyfunctional systems.

Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: -0.8455960866615152
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCC** (chloroethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Alkenes**:
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): -0.70678883  
   - **C1CC=CC1** (cyclopentene): -0.74617771  
   - **CCC1CCCCC1** (propylcyclohexane): -0.431991  
   - **C1CCC=CCC1** (cycloheptene): -0.5563955  
   These molecules have low (negative) property values, likely due to their non-polar, hydrophobic nature.

2. **Chlorinated Hydrocarbons**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): -0.57502238  
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (tetrachlorobenzene): -0.09042291  
   - **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl** (hexachloropentadiene): 2.55064721  
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (iodochlorobenzene): -0.18459322  
   Chlorination tends to increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons, but the effect depends on the number and position of chlorine atoms. Single chlorine substituents (e.g., chlorobenzene) still result in negative values, while multiple chlorines (e.g., hexachloropentadiene) lead to positive values.

3. **Small Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - **CC#N** (acetonitrile): -0.90683586 (very low due to small size and polar nitrile group).  
   - **ClCC** (chloroethane) is analogous to small chlorinated hydrocarbons. Given that chlorobenzene (larger, aromatic) is -0.575, chloroethane (smaller, aliphatic) would likely have a lower value.

### Prediction for ClCC:
- Chloroethane is a small, monochlorinated alkane. Compared to pentane (-0.706), the addition of a single chlorine atom would increase the property value slightly but not enough to make it positive (as seen with chlorobenzene at -0.575).  
- The property value is likely between -0.7 and -0.5. Given its smaller size than chlorobenzene, I estimate it to be closer to -0.7.  

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for ClCC: -0.65**  

This is based on interpolation between the values of simple alkanes (e.g., pentane at -0.706) and monochlorinated aromatics (e.g., chlorobenzene at -0.575), accounting for the smaller size and aliphatic nature of chloroethane.

SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: -0.0017925783385100266
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (n1)** substituted with a **trichloromethyl group (C(Cl)(Cl)Cl)** and a **chlorine (Cl)**. 
   - Pyridine is aromatic and polar, contributing to some hydrophilicity or polarity-related properties.
   - The **CCl3 group** is highly hydrophobic and bulky, which tends to increase the property value (as seen in other molecules with bulky halogenated groups).

2. **Halogen Substitution**: 
   - Multiple chlorines (4 in total) are present, which is a hallmark of molecules with higher property values in the dataset (e.g., **ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)...**, which has a value of **6.784**).
   - However, this molecule is less saturated with halogens than the extreme example above, so the value should be lower.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (3.7156): This has a biphenyl core with CCl3 and chlorines, similar to our molecule but with more aromatic rings. Our molecule is smaller, so the value should be slightly lower.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (1.237): This has two chlorinated aromatic rings but no CCl3 group. Our molecule has CCl3, which should increase the value significantly.
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl** (0.5378): This is a heavily chlorinated benzene with a nitro group. Our molecule has fewer chlorines but a bulky CCl3, which may balance out.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the presence of the **pyridine ring + CCl3 group + chlorine**, the property value is likely in the range of **2.0 to 3.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 2.45**  

This aligns with the trend where bulky, halogenated aromatic systems (especially with CCl3) have values in this range (e.g., **2.461** for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1nc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**). The pyridine nitrogen may slightly reduce the value compared to pure benzene systems, but the CCl3 dominates.

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.5808384856413299
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (which is 2-hexanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - **CC(O)CCC** (linear pentanol derivative): Property value = **-0.46194101**
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (aromatic alcohol): Property value = **-0.42581964**
   - **CCC(C)CCO** (branched alcohol): Property value = **-0.58196595**
   - **CCC(CC)CO** (another branched alcohol): Property value = **-0.58196595**

   Alcohols generally have negative property values in the range of **-0.4 to -0.6**, with branching slightly lowering the value (more negative).

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains or branching tend to slightly decrease the property value (more negative).
   - **CCCCC(C)O** is a branched alcohol (2-hexanol), similar to **CCC(C)CCO** and **CCC(CC)CO**, which both have a value of **-0.58196595**.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(O)CCC** (less branched) has a higher value (-0.46194101) than **CCC(C)CCO** (-0.58196595), suggesting branching reduces the property value.
   - **CCCCC(C)O** is structurally very similar to **CCC(C)CCO** (both are branched alcohols with 6 carbons), so their property values should be close.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CCC(C)CCO** and **CCC(CC)CO**, the property value for **CCCCC(C)O** is expected to be very close to **-0.58**. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCC(C)O** is **-0.58196595**. 

(Note: This matches the value for the structurally similar molecules in the examples, as branching and alcohol functionality are the dominant factors here.)

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.27116515992758533
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene): Property value = **0.80838096**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (4-chlorobiphenyl with another Cl): Property value = **0.80838096** (same as above, suggesting symmetry matters).
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (symmetrical dichlorophenol): Property value = **-0.39413507** (lower due to -OH group).
   - **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** (highly chlorinated): Property value = **2.88212557** (higher due to more halogens/bulk).

2. **Brominated vs. Chlorinated**:
   - Bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine, which may slightly increase the property value compared to chlorinated analogs.
   - No direct brominated examples are given, but we can infer from chlorinated ones.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution**:
   - Symmetrical dihalogenated benzenes (e.g., 1,4-dichlorobenzene) have property values around **0.8**.
   - Adding more halogens or bulky groups increases the value (e.g., **2.88** for hexachlorinated biphenyl).

### Prediction for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1:
- This is **1,4-dibromobenzene**, structurally analogous to 1,4-dichlorobenzene (property = **0.80838096**).
- Bromine's larger size and polarizability may slightly increase the value compared to chlorine.
- No additional functional groups or asymmetry are present to significantly alter the value.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the similarity to 1,4-dichlorobenzene but with bromine's slightly stronger influence, the predicted value would be **slightly higher than 0.80838096**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.85**  
*(This is a conservative adjustment upward from the chlorinated analog's value of 0.808, accounting for bromine's effects.)*  

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is based on the assumption that the property scales with halogen size and substitution pattern. If more examples of brominated compounds were provided, the estimate could be refined further.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 3.159467388372846
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property value tends to increase with the size and complexity of the molecule, particularly with the presence of multiple halogen atoms (Cl, Br) or aromatic systems. 

The molecule in question is:  
**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**  

This is a polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure with **six chlorine atoms** and two aromatic rings. Comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (8.28247404)  
   - This molecule has **10 chlorine atoms** and two aromatic rings, yielding a high property value (~8.28).  

2. **ClC(Br)Br** (-0.6620825)  
   - A small halogenated molecule with just three halogens, yielding a low value (~-0.66).  

3. **O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12** (0.09981207)  
   - A nitro-substituted aromatic system with two rings, yielding a slightly positive value (~0.10).  

4. **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** (4.23998654)  
   - A large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (no halogens), yielding ~4.24.  

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
- The molecule has **6 chlorines** and **two aromatic rings**, making it less halogenated than the first example (8.28) but more halogenated than the nitro-aromatic example (0.10).  
- It is structurally similar to the first example but with fewer chlorines, so we expect a **lower value than 8.28 but higher than 0.10**.  
- The presence of multiple chlorines and aromaticity suggests a **moderate-to-high positive value**.  

### Prediction:
Given the trend, a reasonable estimate would be **between 4.0 and 6.0**.  

Looking at the examples:  
- The large non-halogenated PAH (4.24) and the steroid-like structure (3.29) are in this range.  
- The heavily chlorinated biphenyl (8.28) is higher, while simpler halogenated molecules are much lower.  

Since this molecule is **intermediate in halogenation**, I predict:  
**Predicted property value: ~5.5**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend of increasing values with molecular size/halogenation.)  

---  
**Final Answer:** **5.5** (approximate, based on structural similarity to higher-valued examples).

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 8.676661542540808
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and polarity. The molecule in question is:

**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: Three aromatic rings (two substituted phenyl groups and one central phenyl group).
2. **Phosphate ester linkage (OP(=O)(OAr)(OAr))**: This is a polar and bulky functional group.
3. **Methyl substituents**: Three methyl groups (electron-donating, slightly hydrophobic).
4. **Overall size and branching**: The molecule is large and branched due to the phosphate-linked aromatic systems.

### Observations from the examples:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and polar groups (e.g., carbonyls, phosphate, nitro, etc.) tend to have higher property values (e.g., 5.79680146, 6.49001155, 7.09583254).
- Smaller, less polar molecules (e.g., alkanes, simple aromatics) have lower or negative values (e.g., -0.78546675 for CCCC, -0.44373403 for Clc1ccccc1Cl).
- The presence of phosphate (P=O) groups in the examples correlates with higher values (e.g., 6.49001155 for CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, 1.88358775 for CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC).

### Prediction:
This molecule has:
- A phosphate group (highly polar, contributes to higher value).
- Three aromatic rings (increases size and potential for interactions).
- Methyl groups (slightly offset polarity but not enough to lower the value significantly).

Given these features, the property value should be **moderately high**, similar to other phosphate-containing or multi-aromatic compounds in the examples. 

### Estimated value: **4.8**  
(Reasoning: Between the phosphate-containing examples like 6.49001155 and simpler aromatic phosphates like 1.88358775, but accounting for the additional aromatic rings and methyl groups.) 

**Final predicted property value: 4.8** (approximate).

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 1.3077468186272803
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: This is a highly electronegative and lipophilic group. From the examples, molecules with CF3 (e.g., `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` with CF3-like fragments) tend to have higher property values (e.g., 0.788). CF3 often increases the property value.
2. **Aromatic ring with substitution**: The molecule has a benzene ring substituted with CF3 and a heterocyclic group. Aromatic systems with polar substituents (e.g., NO2, Cl) in the examples often have property values in the range of -0.4 to 0.7.
3. **Heterocyclic lactam (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O)**: This is a polar, rigid group with two chlorine atoms and a ketone. Chlorine substitutions (especially multiple) tend to increase the property value significantly (e.g., `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` has a value of 2.88). The ketone (C=O) adds polarity but may not dominate over the Cl effects.
4. **Overall polarity and size**: The molecule is medium-sized with significant polarity and halogenation, which typically raises the property value.

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with multiple Cl atoms (e.g., `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2`) have high values (~2.88).
- Molecules with CF3 and polar groups (e.g., `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl`) have values around 0.78.
- The presence of both CF3 and two Cl atoms here suggests a higher value than just CF3 or just Cl.

### Prediction:
Given the combined effects of CF3, two Cl atoms, and the polar lactam, the property value is likely in the range of **1.5 to 2.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.85**  

This balances the contributions of the CF3 group (moderate increase) and the two Cl atoms (strong increase). The exact value would depend on finer electronic and steric effects, but this is a plausible interpolation from the given data.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.34590806519250217
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene) has a property value of **-0.34255893**.
   - The nitro group is electron-withdrawing and tends to decrease the property value when present alone or in simple aromatic systems.

2. **Methoxy Group (OCH3)**:
   - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC** (dimethyl phthalate) has a property value of **0.02788519**.
   - Methoxy groups can slightly increase the property value compared to nitro-substituted aromatics.

3. **Combination of Methoxy and Nitro on Aromatic Ring**:
   - The molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitroanisole) has both an electron-donating methoxy group and an electron-withdrawing nitro group on the benzene ring.
   - The methoxy group will counteract some of the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group, leading to a slightly higher property value than a dinitrobenzene but lower than a purely methoxy-substituted aromatic.

4. **Comparison with Similar Structures**:
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol) has a value of **-0.64948127**.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene) has a value of **-0.34255893**.
   - The presence of both substituents (methoxy and nitro) should result in a value between these two, closer to the nitrobenzene due to the stronger effect of the nitro group.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is likely slightly higher than dinitrobenzene but still negative due to the dominant effect of the nitro group. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.25**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples and trends. The actual value may vary slightly depending on the specific property being modeled, such as logP, solubility, or another descriptor.)

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 3.0392313131188007
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and the presence of specific functional groups or halogens (especially chlorine and bromine). The property tends to increase with:

1. **Increased halogenation (especially Cl or Br)**: Molecules with more halogens (Cl, Br) tend to have higher property values, especially if they are heavily substituted. For example:
   - `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (hexachlorocyclohexane) has a value of **0.51781715**.
   - `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (bromonaphthalene) has a value of **0.15313096**.

2. **Molecular size and rigidity**: Larger, more rigid structures (e.g., polycyclic systems) tend to have higher values. For example:
   - `Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13` (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a value of **4.40742175**.

3. **Polar or ionizable groups**: Groups like nitro (`N(=O)=O`), sulfonyl (`S(=O)=O`), or amides (`NC=O`) can increase the value.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule in question is:
`ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl`

This is a **highly chlorinated polycyclic alkane** (likely a derivative of a chlorinated norbornane or similar bridged system). Key features:
- It contains **8 chlorine atoms**, which is more than any other example provided.
- It has a **rigid, polycyclic structure**, which further increases the property value.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (hexachlorocyclohexane, value = **0.51781715**), but the target molecule has:
  1. More chlorines (8 vs. 6).
  2. A more rigid and complex polycyclic structure.

Given this, the property value should be **significantly higher** than 0.51781715. 

Looking at other high-value examples:
- `CC(=O)C3(C)CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (a complex steroid-like molecule) has a value of **7.58902851**.
- `CC(C)OC(=O)C(O)(c1ccc(Br)cc1)c2ccc(Br)cc2` (a dibrominated biphenyl derivative) has a value of **5.36771291**.

The target molecule is less complex than the steroid-like example but more heavily halogenated than the dibrominated biphenyl. 

### Predicted Value:
Given the extreme halogenation and rigidity, a reasonable estimate would be between **5.0 and 7.0**. Splitting the difference and considering the high chlorine count, I predict:

**6.2** (rounded to one decimal place for simplicity). 

For a more precise estimate, I would suggest **6.23456789** (mimicking the format of the given examples). However, based on the trend, a value closer to **6.5** might also be plausible.

### Final Answer:
**6.23456789** (or approximately **6.2**). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. The actual value could vary slightly, but it should be in this high range due to the extreme chlorination and polycyclic structure.)

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.7577096654143074
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains and Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with simple aliphatic chains (e.g., **C1CCCCCC1**, **CCCCCCCCC=C**) tend to have negative property values (around -0.5 to -0.01).
   - The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) or electronegative atoms often reduces the property value further (e.g., **CC(Cl)Cl** has -0.776, **Clc1ccccc1I** has -0.185).
   - Oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., alcohols, ethers) tend to slightly increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons but often remain negative (e.g., **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** has -0.076, **CC(O)c1ccccc1** has -0.426).

2. **Esters and Carbonyl Groups**:
   - Esters (R-COO-R') or carbonyl-containing compounds show a range of values depending on other substituents. For example:
     - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2** has a high value (3.427), but this is likely due to the complex aromatic and ether substituents.
     - Simpler esters like **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** have a slightly negative value (-0.076).
   - The **C=O** group alone doesn't drastically increase the value unless combined with other polar or aromatic features.

3. **Propyl Formate (CCCOC=O)**:
   - This is a simple aliphatic ester with no aromatic rings or additional polar substituents.
   - Compared to **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (-0.076), which has an aromatic ring and an amine group, propyl formate is simpler and less polar, so its value should be slightly more negative.
   - The property value is likely similar to or slightly lower than other simple oxygenated aliphatics (e.g., **CC(O)c1ccccc1** at -0.426 or **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** at -0.076).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the simplicity of **CCCOC=O** and the trends observed, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.35** (between -0.076 for simple aromatic esters and -0.426 for aliphatic alcohols). 

This reflects its aliphatic ester nature with no additional polar or aromatic contributions. 

### Final Answer:
**-0.35** (estimated based on structural similarity to other examples).
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.6128702310454686
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Chain Length**: 
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** with a value of **0.29780306**) tend to have higher (less negative) values compared to shorter chains (e.g., **CC** with **-0.90617379**).
   - The presence of aromatic rings often increases the value slightly (e.g., **c1ccc2ccccc2c1** has **0.00749277**).

2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Hydroxyl (**-OH**) and carbonyl (**C=O**) groups tend to decrease the value (make it more negative), e.g., **Oc1ccc(O)cc1** has **-0.61363494**.
   - Esters (**C(=O)OR**) have mixed effects but generally moderate values unless combined with long chains or aromatic systems.

3. **Halogens**:
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, F) can increase or decrease the value depending on context, but their presence often leads to higher values (e.g., **Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br** has **0.47829179**).

4. **Hybrid Structures**:
   - Molecules with both long aliphatic chains and polar groups (e.g., **CCCC=C(CC)C=O** with **-0.35572103**) tend to have intermediate values.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**
- This is a **long aliphatic chain (10 carbons)** with an **ester group (C(=O)OCC)** at the end.
- The long hydrophobic chain would push the value higher (less negative), similar to **CCCCCCc1ccccc1 (0.29780306)** but even more due to the longer chain.
- The ester group is polar but not as strongly negative as a free hydroxyl or carboxylate, so it may slightly offset the chain's hydrophobicity.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
1. **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (7-carbon chain + aromatic): **0.29780306**
2. **CCCC=C(CC)C=O** (shorter chain + aldehyde): **-0.35572103**
3. **CCCOC** (short chain + ether): **-0.76003245**

Given the long chain dominates, the value should be **positive and moderate**, but the ester reduces it slightly compared to a pure hydrocarbon.

### Predicted Value:
A reasonable estimate is **~0.5 to 1.0**. Given the examples, I predict:  
**0.75** (specific value: **0.75000000**).

This balances the long-chain hydrophobicity and the polar ester group's effect.

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 2.7172464561597467
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic rings with substituents**: The molecule contains two benzene rings with multiple substituents (Cl, OH, C=O, NO2). 
   - Similar to molecules like **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2 (2.951)** and **CC2Nc1cc(Cl)c(cc1C(=O)N2c3ccccc3C)S(N)(=O)=O (5.731)**, which have high property values due to aromatic systems with polar/electron-withdrawing groups.
2. **Polar/electron-withdrawing groups**: 
   - **NO2 (nitro group)**: Strongly electron-withdrawing (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (-0.395)** has a nitro group but is simpler; here, it's combined with other features).
   - **C=O (carbonyl)**: Present in many high-value examples (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 (5.987)**).
   - **Cl (chloro)**: Often increases the property value when combined with other polar groups (e.g., **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl (1.510)**).
3. **Amide linker (C(=O)N)**: Seen in high-value molecules like **CC2Nc1cc(Cl)c(cc1C(=O)N2c3ccccc3C)S(N)(=O)=O (5.731)**.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule is structurally complex, resembling **CC2Nc1cc(Cl)c(cc1C(=O)N2c3ccccc3C)S(N)(=O)=O (5.731)** but with an NO2 group instead of S(N)(=O)=O. The NO2 group is similarly electron-withdrawing, so the value should be comparable.
- It also resembles **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 (5.987)**, which has a P=S group instead of NO2 but similar polar/aromatic features.

### Predicted Value:
Given the combination of:
- Two aromatic rings with Cl substituents,
- A polar amide linker (C(=O)N),
- A nitro group (NO2),
- A hydroxyl group (OH),

the property value is likely **between 4.0 and 6.0**, similar to other complex polar aromatic molecules in the dataset. A reasonable estimate is **~5.2**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 5.2** (specific example: 5.2)

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 14.440569363066665
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and the presence of specific functional groups or heavy atoms (e.g., Cl, S, P, multiple aromatic rings, or conjugated systems). Higher property values are associated with larger, more complex molecules, especially those with multiple aromatic rings, heteroatoms (e.g., S, P, N, O), or halogen substitutions (e.g., Cl). Lower values are associated with simpler aliphatic or small aromatic systems.

The molecule to predict is:  
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**

### Key features of this molecule:
1. **High complexity**: It contains two **phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)OC)**, which are bulky and polar.
2. **Aromatic systems**: Two benzene rings linked by a sulfur atom (thioether bridge), forming a **diphenyl sulfide** core.
3. **Multiple polar groups**: The phosphorothioate groups are highly polar and contribute significantly to the property value.
4. **Symmetry**: The molecule is symmetric, with identical substituents on both aromatic rings, which may further increase the property value.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 3.159) and **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (property = 1.757) are highly chlorinated biphenyl-like structures. The presence of sulfur and phosphorothioate groups here is likely to increase the property value more than chlorine alone.
- **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 5.987) has a phosphorothioate group and a chlorinated aromatic ring, yielding a very high value. The molecule here has **two phosphorothioate groups** and a larger aromatic system, suggesting an even higher value.
- **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (property = 5.305) is a large, rigid steroid-like structure, but the molecule here has more polar and conjugated features.

### Predicted property value:
Given the **two phosphorothioate groups**, the **diphenyl sulfide core**, and the overall size/polarity, the property value is likely **higher than 5.987** (the highest in the examples). However, the exact value depends on the scaling, but it would reasonably fall in the range of **6.0 to 7.0**.

**Final prediction: ~6.5**  
(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an estimate based on structural trends in the data.)

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.49119788266261133
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values:

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1** (phenol) is not explicitly listed, but similar structures with substitutions are present.
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (hydroxybenzamide) has a value of **-0.43902701**.
   - **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** (dimethylphenol) has a value of **-0.41075685**.

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O) Impact**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrotoluene) has a value of **-0.40311083**.
   - **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (a nitrophenyl ether with chlorines) has a much higher value of **1.50766818**, likely due to the combined effects of multiple substituents.

3. **Combined Hydroxy and Nitro Groups**:
   - The molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is a nitrophenol (specifically, 2-nitrophenol or 4-nitrophenol). 
   - The nitro group is electron-withdrawing, while the hydroxy group is electron-donating (but can also participate in intramolecular hydrogen bonding in ortho-substituted nitrophenols). This combination often leads to intermediate property values.

4. **Comparison with Similar Structures**:
   - Nitrotoluene (**Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**) has a value of **-0.40311083**.
   - Hydroxybenzamide (**NC(=O)c1ccccc1O**) has a value of **-0.43902701**.
   - The presence of both hydroxy and nitro groups in **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** would likely result in a value slightly higher than nitrotoluene but lower than heavily substituted systems like the chlorinated nitrophenyl ether.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is expected to be in the range of **-0.2 to 0.2**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 0.1245**  

This accounts for the competing effects of the electron-withdrawing nitro group and the electron-donating hydroxy group, along with potential intramolecular interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding in ortho-nitrophenol).

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 8.027209373198277
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule in question is a complex carbohydrate (likely an oligosaccharide or polysaccharide derivative) with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and ether linkages (C-O-C). 

### Key observations:
1. **Hydrophilicity**: The molecule is highly polar due to the abundance of hydroxyl groups (-OH) and ether linkages (O). This suggests it will have significant hydrogen bonding capacity and likely a high solubility in water.
2. **Molecular size**: The molecule is large (multiple sugar units), which can increase its property value compared to smaller polar molecules.
3. **Comparison to examples**:
   - Smaller polyols like `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (a hexose-like structure) have a property value of **-0.60900007**, but this is much smaller and less complex.
   - Larger molecules with polar groups (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1`) have very high values (**14.44056936**) due to size and multiple polar/charged groups.
   - The given molecule is not as extreme as the phosphorus/sulfur-containing examples but is larger and more polar than simple sugars.

### Predicted property value:
Given the size and high polarity (but lack of charged groups or heavy atoms like P/S), the value should be **moderately high but not extreme**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.8 to 2.5**

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**2.12345678** (a mid-range value reflecting its size and polarity).  

This is based on interpolation between smaller polar molecules (e.g., hexose at -0.6) and very large polar/charged molecules (e.g., 14.4 for the P/S compound). The exact value would depend on the property's scaling with molecular features, but this is a plausible estimate.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -0.8075191540136554
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, aromatics):**
   - Simple alkanes/alkenes/alkynes tend to have negative property values (e.g., `CCCC(=O)C: -0.699`, `CCCCCC=O: -0.604`, `CCCC(C)C(=O)C: -0.605`).
   - Aromatic hydrocarbons without polar groups also tend to have negative values (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32: 0.774` is an exception due to extended conjugation).
   - Alkynes are not explicitly present in the examples, but they are similar to alkenes in terms of polarity.

2. **Functional Groups:**
   - Polar groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -NO2, -C=O) can influence the property, but their effect depends on the context.
   - Molecules with long aliphatic chains and no polar groups tend to have negative values (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO: 1.858` is an exception, likely due to the terminal -OH).

3. **CCC#C (1-butyne):**
   - This is a simple alkyne with no polar functional groups.
   - Similar to other small hydrocarbons like `CCCC(=O)C (-0.699)` or `CCCCCC=O (-0.604)`, but without the polar carbonyl group.
   - The triple bond (#C) is not highly polar, so the molecule is largely nonpolar.

### Prediction:
Given the nonpolar nature of **CCC#C** and the trend for small hydrocarbons to have negative property values, the predicted property value should be in the range of **-0.4 to -0.7**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.55** (interpolating between similar molecules like `CCCC(=O)C: -0.699` and `CCCCCC=O: -0.604` but slightly less negative due to the absence of a polar group).

### Final Answer:
**-0.55** (predicted property value for CCC#C).

Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 2.6236698290125346
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values appear to correlate with molecular features such as:

1. **Polarity and hydrogen bonding**: Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NH, -CO) or hydrogen-bonding capabilities tend to have higher property values.
2. **Aromaticity and conjugation**: Aromatic systems or extended conjugation often increase the property value.
3. **Halogenation (Cl, Br, F)**: The presence of halogens, especially multiple halogens, tends to increase the property value.
4. **Molecular size/complexity**: Larger or more complex molecules (e.g., polycyclic systems) generally have higher values.
5. **Electron-withdrawing/donating groups**: These can influence the property value, though the trend is less clear without more data.

### Analysis of the target molecule:
**CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**

1. **Structural features**:
   - Contains a **phosphorothioate group (P=S)**, which is polar and often associated with higher property values (e.g., 5.98725652 for `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1`).
   - **Aromatic ring with three chlorine atoms**: Highly halogenated aromatic systems tend to have elevated property values (e.g., 3.15946739 for `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`).
   - **Ethoxy and ethyl groups**: These are less polar but do not significantly reduce the value.

2. **Comparison to similar molecules**:
   - `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a value of **5.98725652** (P=S, aromatic Cl, polar groups).
   - `Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` has a value of **1.50766818** (less halogenated but with nitro group).
   - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` has a value of **1.23705382** (similar halogenation but no P=S).

3. **Prediction**:
   - The P=S group and triple Cl substitution suggest a higher value than simpler halogenated aromatics but slightly lower than the P=S example with additional polar groups.
   - The closest analog is `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (5.987), but the target molecule lacks the amide/carbonyl, so the value should be lower.

### Predicted property value: **4.8**  
(Estimated range: 4.5–5.2, likely closer to 4.8 due to P=S and triple Cl). 

This aligns with the observed trend where P=S and heavy halogenation drive the value higher than simpler aromatic systems but not as high as molecules with additional polar functionalities.

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.46003117074878014
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (c1nccc)** with a **substituent (C(=O)NN)**. The substituent is a **hydrazide group (C(=O)NN)**, which is polar and capable of hydrogen bonding.
2. **Key Functional Groups**:
   - Aromatic nitrogen (in pyridine) contributes to polarity and basicity.
   - The **C(=O)NN** group is highly polar and can participate in strong hydrogen bonding (both donor and acceptor).

### Comparison with Given Examples:
- **Polar/Aromatic Systems with H-Bonding**:
  - **Nc1ccccc1Cl** (property: -0.460): Less polar than our molecule due to simpler substituents.
  - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (property: 0.607): Contains amide and aromatic chlorines; our molecule has similar polarity but lacks halogens.
  - **COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1** (property: 0.969): Contains multiple H-bonding sites (like our hydrazide group).
- **Aromatic + Polar Substituents**:
  - **N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property: 0.410): Less polar than our molecule (no H-bonding groups).
  - **Nc1cccc2ccccc12** (property: -0.007): Only an amine, less polar than our hydrazide.

### Inference:
The **hydrazide group (C(=O)NN)** is more polar and H-bonding-capable than most substituents in the examples. This suggests the property value should be **higher than simple aromatic amines** (e.g., > 0.4) but **lower than very complex polar systems** (e.g., < 1.0). 

A reasonable estimate is **~0.75**, considering:
- The pyridine ring contributes some polarity.
- The hydrazide group significantly increases polarity/H-bonding potential (similar to the **COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1** example, but with fewer H-bonding sites).

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1: 0.75** (approximate). 

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend that more polar/H-bonding groups increase the property value in the given examples.)*

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 5.827371362227687
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: This is a polar and moderately bulky functional group. In the examples, molecules with P(=S) (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**) have relatively high positive values (1.22356955). This suggests that P(=S) contributes to increasing the property value.
2. **Thioester linkage (SCC(=O))**: The presence of sulfur (S) and carbonyl (C=O) groups can also contribute to polarity and bulkiness. Sulfur-containing groups in the examples (e.g., **CCS** with -0.80154817) are not directly comparable here due to the additional complexity, but the thioester is likely to increase the value.
3. **Amide group (C(=O)N)**: Amides are polar and can increase the property value, as seen in molecules like **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (-0.54292225) or **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (2.95111407). The cyclic amide here (attached to a cyclohexane ring) adds rigidity and bulk.
4. **Alkyl chains (CCCC, OCCC)**: These are non-polar and tend to decrease the property value, but their effect is secondary to the polar functional groups.
5. **Overall size and complexity**: The molecule is large and contains multiple functional groups, which typically increases the property value (as seen in larger molecules like **CC(C)=CC3C(C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc1ccccc1)c2)C3(C)C** with 8.64547139).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**: Contains P(=S) and aromatic nitro groups, value = 1.22356955.
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2**: Contains amide and aromatic groups, value = 2.95111407.
- **CC(C)=CC3C(C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc1ccccc1)c2)C3(C)C**: Large and complex, value = 8.64547139.

Given that our molecule has:
- A **P(=S)** group (like the first example, contributing ~1.2),
- A **thioester** and **cyclic amide** (adding ~1.5-3.0),
- Significant **size and branching** (adding ~2-4),

but lacks highly polarizing groups like multiple nitro or chlorine substituents (which push values higher, e.g., 4.33979345 for **COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**), a reasonable estimate would be in the range of **2.5 to 4.0**.

### Predicted value:
Considering the balance of polar (P(=S), thioester, amide) and non-polar (alkyl chains) groups, the predicted property value is:  
**3.2** (with an estimated uncertainty of ±0.5).

Thus, the final prediction is:  
**3.2**

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.36521526208882904
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The property appears to be influenced by factors such as molecular size, polarity, functional groups, and aromaticity. 

For the molecule `CCCCCCCC` (octane), which is a linear alkane with no functional groups or aromatic rings, we can compare it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. `CCCCCCCO` (heptanol) has a property value of **-0.46132185**. This molecule is similar but has a polar hydroxyl group, which likely increases the property value slightly compared to a pure hydrocarbon.
2. `CCCC/C=C/C` (an unsaturated hydrocarbon) has a property value of **-0.502502**, which is slightly lower than heptanol but still in the same range.
3. `CCCCCC` (hexane) is not in the dataset, but smaller alkanes like `CCC(C)C` (isobutane) and `CC(C)CCO` (isobutanol) have values around **-0.68 to -0.76**, suggesting that longer alkanes would have less negative (higher) values.

Since `CCCCCCCC` is a longer alkane than `CCCCCCCO` but lacks the polar hydroxyl group, its property value should be slightly lower than **-0.46132185** but not as low as smaller alkanes. 

A reasonable prediction for `CCCCCCCC` would be around **-0.50**. 

**Predicted property value: -0.50** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The property could be logP, solubility, or another molecular descriptor, but the trend holds for many such properties.)

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a multi-ring structure resembling steroids (e.g., fused cyclohexane and cyclopentane rings), similar to some of the higher-valued examples.
2. **Ketone group (=O)**: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) often increases the property value, as seen in other molecules with this feature.
3. **Hydroxyl groups (-OH)**: Two hydroxyl groups are present, which can contribute to higher values (e.g., compare to **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O**, which has a value of **3.2930014**).
4. **Alkyne group (C#C)**: This is a less common feature, but its presence may slightly increase the value due to additional polarity/rigidity.
5. **Ring fusion and complexity**: The molecule is highly fused and rigid, similar to high-value examples like **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** (value: **5.32455597**).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** (value: **3.2930014**), which lacks the alkyne and has one fewer hydroxyl group. Our molecule has an additional -OH and a C#C, which would likely increase the value.
- Another similar molecule is **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** (value: **5.32455597**), which has a ketone, hydroxyl, and a more extended ring system. Our molecule is slightly less complex but has an alkyne.

### Predicted Value:
Given the structural similarities and the trend toward higher values for such features, the predicted property value for **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C** is likely in the range of **4.5 to 5.5**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted value: 4.856**  

This accounts for the steroid-like core, multiple polar groups (C=O, -OH), and the alkyne moiety.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 37.72919578814975
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to predict the property value. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Molecule to Predict:
```
COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
```

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings (e.g., `c1cc...c1` and `c5cc67`), which are also present in many of the examples. Aromaticity tends to increase the property value, especially with fused rings (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons like `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54` has a high value of 4.24).
2. **Oxygen Substituents**: There are multiple methoxy (`OCH3`) and hydroxyl (`OH`) groups, as well as ether linkages (`O`). These are present in examples like `Oc1ccccc1Cl` (-0.534) and `COc1ccccc1Cl` (-0.398), which tend to lower the property value slightly.
3. **Complexity and Size**: The molecule is large and complex, with multiple fused rings and heteroatoms (O). Larger molecules with many fused rings (e.g., `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` has a very high value of 16.46) tend to have higher property values.
4. **Functional Groups**: The presence of carbonyl (`C=O`) and cyclic ethers (`OCO`) may contribute to the property value. For example, `CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2` has a value of 3.37 due to similar complexity.
5. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The molecule is most similar to large, polycyclic structures with oxygen substituents (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1` has a value of 14.44 due to size and heteroatoms).
   - However, it lacks highly polar or charged groups (e.g., sulfonyl or nitro groups) that might push the value higher.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the large size, fused rings, and oxygen substituents, the property value is likely high but not as extreme as the largest examples (e.g., not >20). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 12.5**  

This is based on:
- The molecule's size and complexity being comparable to examples with values ~10-15.
- The presence of oxygen substituents slightly moderating the value compared to purely hydrocarbon fused rings.

Iteration: 86
SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.534199040579674
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Substituents and Their Effects**:
   - **Phenol (Oc1ccccc1)**: The presence of an -OH group on a benzene ring tends to lower the property value (negative contribution). For example:
     - `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a value of **-0.49119788**.
     - `Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` also has **-0.49119788** (same substituent effect).
   - **Chlorine (Cl)**: Chlorine substituents on aromatic rings tend to have a moderate negative or near-zero effect, depending on the context:
     - `Clc1ccccc1I` has **-0.18459322**.
     - `Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl` has **0.80838096** (suggests some positive contribution when multiple Cl are present or in conjugated systems).

2. **Combined Substituents**:
   - When -OH and -Cl are both present on a benzene ring, their effects appear additive. For example:
     - `Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (**-0.49119788**) vs. `Clc1ccccc1I` (**-0.18459322**) suggests that -OH has a stronger negative contribution than -Cl.
   - The molecule `Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I` (**0.54516741**) has a positive value due to the strongly electron-withdrawing -C#N and heavy iodine atoms, but this is not directly comparable.

3. **Similar Structures**:
   - `Oc1ccccc1F` (fluorophenol) has **-0.68390155**, indicating that -F (more electronegative than -Cl) further lowers the value compared to -Cl.
   - `Clc1ccccc1I` (**-0.18459322**) suggests that -Cl alone is less negative than -OH.

### Prediction for Oc1ccccc1Cl:
- The molecule is **4-chlorophenol** (OH and Cl on a benzene ring).
- The -OH group dominates the property value, contributing a strong negative effect (similar to phenol derivatives, around **-0.4 to -0.5**).
- The -Cl substituent is less negative than -OH but still reduces the value slightly compared to phenol alone.
- From the examples, phenol with -NO2 (strong electron-withdrawing) gives **-0.491**, while -Cl is less electron-withdrawing than -NO2, so the value should be less negative than **-0.491** but more negative than **-0.184** (for -Cl alone).

### Estimated Value:
A reasonable interpolation suggests a value between **-0.3 and -0.4**. Given the trends, a plausible prediction is:

**Predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl: -0.35**  

(Note: This is an educated estimate based on the given examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or experimental data would be needed.)

   - **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (property: 0.02022094): Chlorinated aromatic but no polar groups like amides.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of **two chlorine atoms** (one aliphatic, one aromatic) and the **amide group** (**OC(=O)N**) increases polarity and likely the property value compared to simple halogenated aromatics.
   - The **triple bond (C#C)** may slightly reduce the property compared to fully saturated or aromatic systems due to reduced polarizability.
   - The molecule is less halogenated than **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2cc(Cl)c(F)c(Cl)c2F** (property: 2.724) but more complex than **CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1** (property: 0.167).

### Prediction:
Given the balance of features, the property value is likely between **0.5 and 1.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.85**  

This accounts for:
- The amide group's contribution (~0.3–0.5 increase over non-polar analogs).
- The two chlorines (~0.2–0.4 each, depending on position).
- The triple bond's slight reduction effect (~-0.1). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the given data.)

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 4.111795314984465
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a central oxygen (O) connected to three aromatic rings:
   - A chlorinated phenyl ring: **c1ccc(Cl)cc1**
   - A pyrimidine-like ring (heterocyclic with N atoms): **c2cncnc2**
   - Another chlorinated phenyl ring: **c3ccccc3Cl**

2. **Substituents**:
   - Two chlorine atoms (Cl) on the phenyl rings, which are electronegative and can influence the property.
   - A heterocyclic ring with nitrogen (pyrimidine-like), which can contribute to polarity and hydrogen bonding potential.

3. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is moderately large (3 aromatic rings) and has polar groups (O, Cl, N), suggesting it is not highly hydrophobic but not extremely polar either.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (Property: 3.71564671): This has multiple Cl atoms and a bulky structure, similar to our molecule but with more Cl. Our molecule has fewer Cl but a heterocycle, which may balance the property.
- **ClC(Cl)=C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** (Property: 2.94441491): Similar chlorinated biphenyl structure but no heterocycle. Our molecule's heterocycle may increase the property slightly.
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (Property: 2.95111407): Has a polar amide and Cl, somewhat similar in polarity and size.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarities to molecules with properties in the **2.9–3.7 range**, but with fewer Cl atoms and a heterocycle, a reasonable prediction would be slightly lower than the heavily chlorinated examples but higher than simpler aromatic systems. 

**Predicted Property Value: ~3.2**  
(A reasonable estimate would be **3.25**, considering the balance of Cl substituents and the heterocyclic ring.) 

### Final Answer:
**3.25** (approximate, based on structural comparison).

Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.6735761067051285
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains and Functional Groups**:
   - **CCCCBr** (butyl bromide): -0.63693101
   - **CCCC=O** (butyraldehyde): -0.60389361
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate): -0.57290615
   - **CCS** (ethyl mercaptan): -0.80154817
   - **CCI** (ethyl iodide): -0.71851951
   - **ClC=C** (chloroethene): -0.85011375

   These molecules with simple aliphatic chains and polar functional groups (halogens, carbonyls, thiols) tend to have negative property values, typically in the range of -0.5 to -0.8.

2. **Esters and Carbonyl-Containing Compounds**:
   - **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate): -0.57290615
   - **O=Cc1ccco1** (furan-2-carbaldehyde): -0.7268968
   - **CN(C)C(=O)C** (N,N-dimethylacetamide): -0.7220112

   Esters and aldehydes/ketones with small aliphatic chains tend to have property values around -0.5 to -0.7.

3. **Impact of Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains or branching (e.g., **CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1**: 0.05073881) can slightly increase the property value, but the dominant factor seems to be the functional group.

### Analysis of **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate):
- This is an ester with a butyl chain and a formate group (HCOO-). 
- Compared to **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate, -0.57290615), which is also an ester but with a longer acyl chain, butyl formate has a shorter acyl chain (formate vs. butyrate). 
- The formate group (HCOO-) is more polar than the butyrate group, which might slightly lower the property value.
- However, the butyl chain is longer than the ethyl chain in ethyl acetate (**CC(=O)OCC**, -0.57290615), which could offset this slightly.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, I would predict the property value for **CCCCOC=O** to be slightly more negative than ethyl butyrate (-0.57290615) but less negative than simple aldehydes like butyraldehyde (-0.60389361). 

**Predicted value: -0.59** (approximate, likely in the range of -0.58 to -0.62). 

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at **CCCC=O** (-0.60389361) and **CC(=O)OCC** (-0.57290615), butyl formate is intermediate in polarity/structure, so a reasonable prediction is:

**Final predicted value: -0.59** (closer to -0.6 due to the formate group's polarity). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCCOC=O** is **-0.59**.

Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.8432213236303933
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the given molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) in the context of the provided data.

### Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Alkanes**: 
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of **-0.77189319**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene) has a property value of **0.14503779**.
   - **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(NC=O)...** (a heavily chlorinated compound) has a high value of **4.42470852**, but this is likely due to other functional groups contributing significantly.

2. **Small Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - **ClCCCl** is a simple dichlorinated alkane with a value of **-0.77189319**.
   - **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) is even smaller and less polarizable than ClCCCl, so we might expect its property value to be slightly lower (more negative) than ClCCCl.

3. **General Trend**:
   - Smaller, less polarizable molecules with fewer heavy atoms tend to have more negative property values.
   - Adding chlorines increases the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons, but for very small molecules, the effect is still modestly negative.

### Prediction for ClCCl:
Given that:
- **ClCCCl** has a value of **-0.77189319**,
- **ClCCl** is smaller and less polarizable,

a reasonable estimate would be slightly more negative than **ClCCCl**. 

### Predicted Property Value for ClCCl:
**-0.85** (approximate, based on the trend). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given examples. If more context were provided, the prediction could be refined.)

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.4107568534572039
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify structural patterns that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - **Oc1ccccc1** (phenol) has a property value of **-0.61363494**.
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol) has a similar value of **-0.61363494**.
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (a methyl-substituted phenol) has a value of **-0.07106284**, suggesting that alkyl substitution (especially on the aromatic ring) increases the property value.

2. **Methyl Substitution**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene) is not in the dataset, but **Brc1ccccc1** (bromobenzene) has a value of **-0.50771341**, indicating that simple monosubstituted benzenes tend to have negative values.
   - Adding a polar group (e.g., -OH) further influences the value, as seen in phenol derivatives.

3. **Specific Case of Cc1cccc(C)c1O**:
   - This is **2-methyl-4-cresol** (a phenol with two methyl groups at positions 2 and 4).
   - Compared to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (which has a value of **-0.07106284**), this molecule has slightly less steric bulk but similar substitution.
   - The additional methyl group likely increases the property value slightly compared to phenol but not as much as bulkier alkyl substitutions.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Phenol: **-0.61363494**
- Methyl-substituted phenol (CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O): **-0.07106284**
- The molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** has two methyl groups (less bulky than a tert-butyl group but more than a single methyl), so its value should be between these two, closer to the methyl-substituted phenol but slightly lower due to less bulk.

### Estimated Property Value:
**~ -0.2 to 0.0**

A reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.15**  

*(This is an educated guess based on the examples, as the exact relationship between structure and property is not explicitly defined in the given data. For precise predictions, a model trained on these examples would be needed.)*  

Would you like me to refine this further based on additional reasoning?

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 1.757876726377673
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl**: This heavily chlorinated biphenyl-like structure has a property value of **2.39065878**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl**: This is a more heavily chlorinated biphenyl with a higher value of **3.15946739**.
   - **Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl**: A less chlorinated phenol with a value of **-0.01720779**.

2. **Structural Similarity**:
   - The molecule in question is a **chlorinated biphenyl** (two benzene rings linked directly, with multiple chlorine substituents). This is similar to the second example above but with slightly fewer chlorines (5 chlorines vs. 7 in the second example).

3. **Trends**:
   - Increasing the number of chlorines on aromatic rings tends to **increase the property value** (compare the first two examples).
   - The presence of additional functional groups (e.g., -NO2, -OH) can reduce or modify the value (e.g., **Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl** has a negative value).

### Prediction for **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**:
- This molecule is a **chlorinated biphenyl with 5 chlorines** (similar to the first example but with one fewer chlorine on each ring compared to the second example).
- The value should be **between the first two examples** (2.39065878 and 3.15946739) but closer to the first due to fewer chlorines.
- A reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than the first example but not as high as the second, likely around **2.7–2.9**.

### Final Predicted Value:
Given the trends and similarities, the predicted property value for **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** is approximately **2.75**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The property could relate to logP, polarizability, or another molecular descriptor.)

Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.7085354940042888
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Alkenes**:
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): Property = **-0.01524415**
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane): Property = **-0.36521526**
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): Property = **-0.20926496**
   - **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (branched aldehyde): Property = **-0.35494643**

   Hydrocarbons (alkanes/alkenes) tend to have negative property values, with alkenes slightly less negative than alkanes. Branching also seems to reduce the magnitude of the negative value.

2. **Small Alkenes**:
   - **COC(=O)C=C** (methyl acrylate): Property = **-0.75927064**
     - This has a highly negative value, but it includes an ester group, which complicates direct comparison.
   - **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene) is a simple branched alkene, similar to nonene but smaller and more branched.

3. **Branched vs. Unbranched**:
   - Branching (e.g., **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**) tends to make the property less negative compared to linear chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCC**).

### Prediction for **CC=C(C)C**:
- This is a branched alkene (isoprene) with 5 carbons and one double bond.
- Compared to **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene, property = -0.015), isoprene is smaller and more branched, which would likely make its property more negative.
- Compared to **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (property = -0.209), isoprene has a double bond, which might offset some of the branching effect.

Given these trends, I estimate the property for **CC=C(C)C** to be slightly more negative than nonene but less negative than a fully saturated branched alkane. A reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: -0.25**

This aligns with the observed trends for small branched alkenes in the dataset.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.8432213236303933
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The molecule in question is **ClCCl** (dichloromethane, CH2Cl2). 

### Observations from the dataset:
1. **Chlorinated alkanes**: 
   - **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (tetrachloroethylene) has a property value of **-0.5986233**.
   - **Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobenzene derivative) has a high value of **5.22841435**, but this is a heavily chlorinated aromatic system, which is not comparable to ClCCl.
   - **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl** (a complex chlorinated polycyclic) has a value of **3.03923131**, but again, this is not directly comparable.

2. **Simple chlorinated molecules**:
   - The closest simple chlorinated molecule is **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (tetrachloroethylene, -0.5986233), which is more chlorinated than ClCCl.
   - **ClCCl** is less chlorinated, so we might expect a slightly less negative (or more positive) value than -0.5986233.

3. **General trend**:
   - Small, non-aromatic chlorinated molecules tend to have negative property values in this dataset.
   - The presence of more chlorines tends to decrease the property value (more negative), but this is not absolute (e.g., aromatic chlorinated systems can have high positive values).

### Prediction for ClCCl:
Given that:
- ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a value of -0.5986233,
- ClCCl is less chlorinated and simpler, 

a reasonable estimate would be slightly less negative than -0.5986233. 

**Predicted property value for ClCCl: -0.55** (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity). 

This is an educated guess based on the limited examples, as no exact match for ClCCl is present in the dataset. The actual value could vary depending on the specific property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), but this is a plausible interpolation.

**Final answer: -0.55** (approximate).

Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.223962118041008
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - The molecule **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (given in the examples) has a property value of **-0.22396212**. This is a chlorinated phenol with three chlorine substituents.
   - The molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** (the query) is very similar, also a chlorinated phenol with three chlorine substituents but with a slightly different substitution pattern (two chlorines adjacent to the hydroxyl group and one opposite).

2. **Effect of Chlorine Substituents**:
   - Chlorine atoms generally increase the property value compared to non-chlorinated analogs, but the exact value depends on the substitution pattern.
   - In the given example, the property is slightly negative (-0.22396212), suggesting that while chlorines add some positive contribution, the overall molecule remains in the lower range.

3. **Comparison with Other Chlorinated Aromatics**:
   - **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** (brominated analog) has a value of **0.04790669**, which is slightly higher than the chlorinated phenol. Halogens seem to contribute similarly.
   - **ClCC** (simple chloroalkane) has a very low value (-0.84559609), indicating that aromatic chlorines have a less negative effect.

4. **Hydroxyl Group Influence**:
   - The hydroxyl group (OH) in phenols tends to lower the property value compared to non-hydroxylated chlorinated aromatics (e.g., **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** has 0.16515307, while the chlorinated phenol is lower).

### Prediction:
The query molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is structurally very similar to the given example **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl**, with only a minor difference in chlorine positioning. Since the substitution pattern is nearly identical (three chlorines and one hydroxyl), the property value should be close to the given example. 

However, the query molecule has two chlorines adjacent to the hydroxyl group (ortho positions) and one chlorine meta to it, which might slightly increase steric and electronic effects compared to the example where the chlorines are more spread out. This could lead to a small increase in the property value.

### Final Prediction:
Given the similarity, I predict the property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** to be **-0.20**, slightly higher than the example (-0.22396212) due to the ortho-chlorine effects. 

(Note: If the exact value is required, it would likely be in the range of **-0.20 to -0.22** based on the given data.) 

**Answer: -0.21** (a reasonable interpolation between the given example and expected trends).

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 37.72919578814975
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the provided molecule and the examples, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to predict the property value.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple functional groups:
1. **Aromatic rings with methoxy (-OCH3) and hydroxyl (-OH) substituents**: Similar to examples like `Cc1cc(C)c(O)c(C)c1` (-0.254) and `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (-0.491), but with more substitutions.
2. **Sugar-like moieties (tetrahydrofuran and pyran rings with multiple -OH and -OCH3 groups)**: Similar to `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (1.404) but more complex.
3. **Lactone (cyclic ester) group**: Seen in `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` (6.073), though this is a smaller part of the structure.
4. **Fused polycyclic system**: Similar to `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5cccc6c(c1)c2c3c4c56` (6.421), but with heteroatoms and polar groups.

### Key Observations:
- The presence of multiple polar groups (-OH, -OCH3) and a lactone suggests moderate polarity, similar to the sugar-like examples (~1.0–1.5 range).
- The fused polycyclic system with heteroatoms increases the property value compared to simpler aromatic systems (e.g., `Sc1ccccc1` is -0.519, while fused systems like `c2ccc1nc(ccc1c2)c4ccc3ccccc3n4` are 3.252).
- The size and complexity (many rings and substituents) push the value higher, similar to the large polycyclic examples (e.g., 6.420 for the large fused aromatic system).

### Comparison to Examples:
1. The sugar-like parts resemble `OCC1OC(...)C1O` (1.404), but the target has more rings and substitutions.
2. The fused system resembles `c1cc2ccc3...c56` (6.421), but with polar groups reducing hydrophobicity.
3. The lactone is similar to steroid-like structures (e.g., 6.073 for `CC12CCC3C(...)C(=O)CO`).

### Prediction:
Given the balance of polar groups (reducing the value compared to pure hydrocarbons) and the fused polycyclic system (increasing the value), the property likely falls in the range of **4.0 to 5.0**. 

A reasonable estimate is **4.75**, considering:
- The sugar-like parts contribute ~1.5.
- The fused polycyclic system contributes ~3.0–4.0 (adjusted for polar groups).
- The lactone adds ~0.5.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 4.75**

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.45781361925295244
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Heterocyclic Core**: The molecule contains a 5-membered heterocycle with nitrogen and sulfur atoms (`S-c1nnc`), similar to some of the provided examples (e.g., `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C`, which has a property value of **1.07447582**). The presence of multiple nitrogens and a sulfur atom suggests moderate polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.
2. **Substituents**:
   - A thioether group (`CS-`) attached to the ring, which is moderately hydrophobic.
   - A carbonyl group (`c(=O)`) and an amide-like nitrogen (`N1N`), contributing to polarity and hydrogen bonding.
   - A bulky tert-butyl group (`C(C)(C)C`), which adds significant hydrophobicity and steric bulk.
3. **Similar Examples**:
   - The molecule `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (property = **1.07447582**) shares a similar heterocyclic core with nitrogen and sulfur, as well as a tert-butyl group. Our molecule has a slightly simpler structure but similar functional groups.
   - The molecule `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1` (property = **-0.51125909**) has a simpler heterocycle with fewer hydrophobic groups, leading to a lower value. Our molecule's tert-butyl group and thioether likely increase the property value compared to this.

### Property Prediction:
Given the structural similarities to the example with a value of **1.07447582**, but with slightly less complexity (no additional fused ring or oxygen), the property value for **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C** is expected to be slightly lower but still in the same range. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: 0.85**  

This accounts for:
- The polar heterocycle and amide-like groups (increasing the value).
- The hydrophobic tert-butyl and thioether (balancing the polarity but not drastically reducing it).
- The absence of additional fused rings or highly polar substituents (preventing it from reaching much higher values like >1.5). 

Thus, the final predicted value is:  
**0.85** (approximate, based on structural analogies).

Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains**: 
   - **CC** (ethane) has a low value (-0.906). 
   - Longer chains (e.g., **CCCC/C=C/C**) have slightly higher but still negative values (-0.502). 
   - Adding polar groups like **OH** (e.g., **CCCC(O)CCC**) gives a modest increase (-0.461).

2. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - Bare benzene (**c1ccccc1**) is not explicitly given, but substituted aromatics have varying values:

     - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): -0.316.
     - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrotoluene): -0.403.
   - Aromatic rings with conjugated systems (e.g., **o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, a polycyclic aromatic) have higher values (0.265).

3. **Esters and Carbonyls**:
   - **COCC(=O)OC** (methyl acetate analog): -0.452.
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate): -0.452 (same as above, suggesting ester contribution is consistent).
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2**: Very high (5.993), but this is due to the complex sulfonamide and additional functional groups.

4. **Specific Case**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is ethyl benzoate, which combines an ester (**CCOC(=O)**) with a benzene ring. 
   - From the examples:
     - Esters alone (e.g., **CCCC(=O)OCC**) give ~-0.45.
     - Aromatics with simple substituents (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1**) give ~-0.3 to -0.6.
     - The combination is likely additive or slightly higher than the individual contributions.

### Prediction:
The property for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is likely slightly higher than a simple ester or aromatic alone. Given:
- Esters: ~-0.45.
- Aromatics: ~-0.3 to -0.6.
- The conjugation between the ester and benzene may slightly increase the value.

A reasonable estimate is **-0.35 to -0.45**. Looking at similar molecules:
- **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenyl ether): 0.223 (higher due to two aromatic rings).
- **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (a diketone with aromatic): 0.015.

Since ethyl benzoate is less conjugated than these, but more than a simple ester, a value around **-0.40** is plausible. 

However, the closest direct analog is **CCCC(=O)OCC** (-0.452), and adding the aromatic ring might increase it slightly. Thus, the predicted value is:

**Predicted property value: -0.40** (approximate, likely between -0.35 and -0.45). 

Given the examples, a more precise estimate would be **-0.42**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on interpolating trends in the data. The property could be logP, polarizability, or another descriptor, but the approach is the same.) 

**Final answer: -0.42** (likely close to the ester examples, adjusted slightly for the aromatic ring). 

---
**Correction**: Upon revisiting the examples, **CCCC(=O)OCC** and **COCC(=O)OC** both have the same value (-0.452), suggesting the ester contribution is very consistent. The aromatic ring in **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** would likely increase the value slightly (less negative), so a better estimate is **-0.35**. 

**Refined prediction: -0.35**. 

---
**Final refined answer: -0.35**. 

(If the property is logP, this aligns with ethyl benzoate being slightly more hydrophobic than simple esters but less than purely aromatic systems.) 

**Final predicted value: -0.35**.
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.24553933275405307
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkyl Halides (e.g., CI, Cl-containing molecules):**
   - **CI** has a property value of **-0.79527051**.
   - Other small alkyl halides or molecules with halogens (Cl, Br) tend to have negative values unless they are part of larger, more complex structures (e.g., polychlorinated aromatics, which have high positive values).

2. **Linear Alkanes/Alkyl Chains:**
   - **CCCC (=O)CCC** (heptan-4-one): **-0.48952761**
   - **CCCCCCCO** (octan-1-ol): **-0.46132185**
   - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-heptene): **-0.36820754**
   - Longer alkyl chains with simple functional groups tend to have moderately negative values.

3. **Brominated Aromatics:**
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene): **0.15313096** (slightly positive due to aromaticity and bromine).
   - **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**: **0.57953782** (more complex brominated heterocycle).

4. **Effect of Bromine in Aliphatic Chains:**
   - The presence of bromine in an aliphatic chain (like **CCCCCCCBr**) is analogous to **CI** but with a longer alkyl chain. The alkyl chain length slightly reduces the magnitude of the property value (less negative) compared to smaller halides like **CI**.

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCBr**:
- **CI** is a very small molecule with a highly negative value (**-0.79527051**).
- **CCCCCCCO** (octan-1-ol) has a value of **-0.46132185**, showing that longer chains reduce the magnitude of the property.
- Bromine is less electronegative than chlorine, so **Br** in an aliphatic chain would have a less negative effect than **Cl**.
- The molecule **CCCCCCCBr** is a linear alkyl bromide, similar to the aliphatic examples but with **Br** replacing **OH** or **Cl**.

Given these trends, the property value for **CCCCCCCBr** should be slightly less negative than **CI** but comparable to other medium-sized alkyl halides or alcohols. 

### Estimated Value:
A reasonable prediction is **-0.45 to -0.55**. Looking at the examples, **CCCCCCCO** is **-0.46132185**, and **CI** is **-0.79527051**. Since **Br** is less polarizing than **Cl** but more than an **OH** group, I would predict:

**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr: -0.50** (approximate, likely between -0.45 and -0.55). 

For specificity, I'll round to **-0.48** (similar to **CCCCCCCO** but slightly more negative due to **Br**). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.48**
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.9389206417382125
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. Simple molecules with fewer atoms and less polarity tend to have lower (more negative) property values, while more complex or polar molecules (especially those with nitro groups, aromatic systems, or multiple functional groups) tend to have higher values.

The molecule **CO (carbon monoxide)** is very small and nonpolar, with no additional functional groups or complexity. Comparing it to similar small molecules in the dataset:
- **CCC (propane)**: -0.85122076  
- **CC#C (propyne)**: -0.86965076  
- **NC(=O)N (urea)**: -0.87856743  

CO is even simpler than these examples (just two atoms with a triple bond), so its property value would likely be on the lower (more negative) end of the scale.  

### Predicted property value for **CO**:  
**Approximately -0.90 to -0.95**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. If the property is something like *logP*, CO’s small size and lack of hydrophobicity would align with this prediction.)  

Would you like to clarify the property being predicted for greater accuracy?
