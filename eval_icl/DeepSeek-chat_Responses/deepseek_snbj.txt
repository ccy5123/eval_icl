SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.792299158454901
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The molecule in question is **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**, which is a long-chain aliphatic ester (specifically, a methyl ester of a decanoic acid derivative). 

### Observations from the dataset:
1. **Long aliphatic chains** (e.g., CCCCCC, CCCCC(C)C, CCCCCCC(C)O) tend to have **negative property values**, especially when they lack polar or functional groups. For example:
   - CCCCCC: -0.71572402  
   - CCCCC(C)C: -0.06340708  
   - CCCCCCC(C)O: 0.45711712 (slightly positive due to the -OH group).  

2. **Esters** (e.g., CCOC(=O)CC, CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC) tend to have **negative property values**, especially with longer chains:
   - CCOC(=O)CC: -0.69287574  
   - CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC: -0.81223749 (very similar structure to the query molecule but with one fewer carbon).  

3. The presence of **aromatic rings or polar groups** can shift the property toward positive values, but this molecule lacks such features.

### Prediction:
The query molecule, **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**, is structurally very similar to **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (from the examples), which has a property value of **-0.81223749**. The only difference is one additional methylene (-CH2-) unit in the query molecule. 

Since longer aliphatic chains generally decrease the property value slightly (as seen in the trend from CCCCCC to CCCCC(C)C), we can expect the property for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** to be **slightly more negative** than -0.81223749.  

### Final predicted value:
**-0.82** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the examples).  

This aligns with the trend that longer, less polar aliphatic chains with ester groups yield more negative property values.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.47610034001227236
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **benzofuran-2-one-like** scaffold (a benzene fused to a lactone-like ring with an NH group). Specifically:
   - A benzene ring (`c2ccc...c2`) fused to a 5-membered ring (`oc(=O)[nH]c1`).
   - The 5-membered ring has a lactam-like moiety (`C=O` and `NH`), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
   - A **chlorine substituent** on the benzene ring (`Cl`), which is electronegative and contributes to polarity.

2. **Key Functional Groups**:
   - Aromatic ring (benzene).
   - Lactam-like group (`C=O` and `NH`), similar to the uracil-like fragments in some of the examples (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1...`).
   - Chlorine substituent, which is common in several examples.

### Comparison with Given Examples:
- **Positive Property Values**:
  - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1...`, `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O`) tend to have high positive values (~0.9 to 0.96).
  - Chlorinated aromatics with additional polar groups (e.g., `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl`, 0.96) also have high values.
- **Negative Property Values**:
  - Non-polar or sterically hindered molecules (e.g., `CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1`, -0.80) or heavily halogenated non-polar systems (e.g., `BrC(Cl)Cl`, -0.82) have negative values.
  - The presence of `NH` and `C=O` in a cyclic system (like in `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)`, 0.909) tends to increase the property value.

### Prediction:
The molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2** has:
- A polar lactam-like group (similar to uracil derivatives, which have high positive values).
- A chlorine substituent (which can increase polarity but depends on context).
- No bulky non-polar groups to drag the value down.

Given the similarity to cyclic polar structures like `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)` (0.909) and the absence of strongly negative features, the property value is likely **positive and moderately high**.

### Predicted Value:
**0.85** (approximate, based on structural analogy to high-value polar examples). 

This is a rough estimate, as the exact property is not specified, but the trend suggests a value in this range due to the polar and conjugated nature of the molecule.

Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.5580856518748714
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - The molecule **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** has a nitro group and a property value of **-0.28954566**.
   - Nitro groups are generally electron-withdrawing, which may contribute to negative property values, but the exact value depends on the rest of the structure.

2. **Alkyl Groups**:
   - Simple alkyl groups (e.g., **CCCOCC**, **CCCCCl**) tend to have moderately negative to slightly positive values, depending on branching and other substituents.
   - **CC(C)N(=O)=O** has a branched alkyl group (isopropyl) attached to the nitro group.

3. **Similar Structures**:
   - The molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is a nitroalkane (specifically, 2-nitropropane). 
   - Comparing to **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO**, which has a nitro group attached to a heterocycle and other substituents, **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is simpler but still has a nitro group with alkyl substitution.

4. **Polarity and Electron Effects**:
   - The nitro group is highly polar and electron-withdrawing, which likely dominates the property value.
   - The isopropyl group is weakly electron-donating, which may slightly offset the nitro group's effect.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for **CC(C)N(=O)=O** should be moderately negative, similar to other nitro-containing compounds but slightly less negative than more complex nitroheterocycles (like **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO**, which has a value of **-0.28954566**). 

A reasonable estimate would be slightly more negative than **-0.28954566** due to the lack of additional polar or aromatic groups that might modulate the effect. 

### Final Prediction:
**-0.35** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The true value could vary depending on the specific property, such as logP, dipole moment, or another molecular descriptor.)

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: -0.4505331180641893
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and the presence of polar or nonpolar groups. The molecule in question is:

**CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**

### Key structural features:
1. **Steroid-like framework**: The molecule has a multi-ring structure resembling steroids or terpenes, which are often associated with moderate to high property values (e.g., `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` has a value of `-0.78284624`).
2. **Polar functional groups**: 
   - A hydroxyl group (`-OH`), which tends to lower the property value (e.g., `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl` has `-0.85398404`).
   - A carbonyl group (`C=O`), which can increase or decrease the value depending on context (here, it's part of a rigid ring system).
   - A terminal `C(=O)CO` group, which introduces additional polarity.
3. **Size and rigidity**: The molecule is large and rigid, which often leads to moderate property values (e.g., `C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13` has `0.76448285`).

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- The closest analog in the examples is `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` (value: `-0.78284624`), which lacks the hydroxyl and terminal `C(=O)CO` groups but shares the steroid-like framework. The additional polar groups in the query molecule would likely lower the value further.
- Another similar molecule is `CCCC(=O)CCC` (value: `0.08844264`), but this is much simpler and less polar.

### Prediction:
Given the steroid-like framework and the presence of multiple polar groups (hydroxyl and carbonyl), the property value is likely **negative and moderately large**. Considering the examples, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: `-0.65`**  

This aligns with the trend where large, polar, polycyclic structures tend to have negative values in the range of `-0.6` to `-0.8`. The exact value could vary slightly, but `-0.65` is a plausible midpoint.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: -0.04770085892929686
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). Aromatic rings with halogens are present in many examples, and their contributions vary based on the halogen type and substitution pattern.
   - Example: **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** has a value of **0.88038304** (chlorinated aromatic).
   - Example: **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** has a value of **-0.85148622** (fluorinated aromatic).
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a value of **-0.29600589** (dichlorinated aromatic).

2. **Amide Groups**: The molecule has two amide groups (**C(=O)N**), which are polar and can hydrogen bond. Similar groups appear in:
   - Example: **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** has a value of **-0.67047712** (thioamide).
   - Example: **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1** has a value of **0.62666998** (amide-like group).

3. **Halogen Substituents**: The presence of fluorine and chlorine atoms can significantly influence the property. Fluorine tends to be more electronegative and may lower the value, while chlorine's effect is mixed (see examples above).

4. **Bridging Group**: The **C(=O)NC(=O)N** linker is unique but resembles amide-like or urea-like fragments, which may contribute polarity or hydrogen bonding.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The molecule is somewhat similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (dichlorinated aromatic, value = **-0.29600589**) but with additional polar amide groups and fluorine substituents.
- The amide groups might increase the value (as in **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, value = **0.62666998**), but the fluorines could decrease it (as in **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1**, value = **-0.85148622**).
- The presence of both electron-withdrawing (F, Cl) and polar (amide) groups suggests a balance between competing effects.

### Predicted Value:
Given the competing influences:
- The fluorinated aromatic ring likely lowers the value.
- The amide groups likely raise the value.
- The chlorinated aromatic ring has a moderate effect.

A reasonable estimate is **between -0.3 and 0.3**. Given the examples, a value closer to **0.0** seems plausible, but leaning slightly negative due to the fluorines.

**Final Prediction: -0.15** (a balanced estimate considering the structural features and trends in the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.6263920579940547
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl propyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ethers and Oxygen-Containing Compounds**:
   - **CCOC(=O)CC** (ethyl propanoate): Property = **-0.69287574**
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (guaiacol): Property = **-0.65198817**
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (sorbitol): Property = **-0.77093386**
   - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (triethyl phosphate): Property = **-0.41650555**
   - **CCCO** (1-propanol): Not explicitly given, but **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol) has Property = **-0.71572402**.

   Ethers and alcohols tend to have negative property values, especially with longer aliphatic chains.

2. **Branching Effects**:
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (2,2-dimethyl-3-butanol): Property = **0.14380716**
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (2,2,3-trimethylbutane): Property = **-0.78623584**
   - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (2-methyl-2-hexanol): Property = **-0.1243668**

   Branching can slightly increase or decrease the property value, but the effect is not dominant compared to functional groups.

3. **Simple Ethers**:
   - The given examples do not include simple aliphatic ethers like **CCCOC(C)C**, but **CCOC(=O)CC** (ester, not ether) has Property = **-0.69287574**.
   - Ethers are less polar than alcohols, so their property values might be less negative than alcohols but still negative.

4. **Chain Length**:
   - Longer chains tend to decrease the property value (e.g., **CCCCCO** = -0.71572402 vs. **CCCO** would likely be less negative).
   - **CCCOC(C)C** has a moderate chain length (5 non-hydrogen atoms in the main chain).

### Prediction for **CCCOC(C)C**:
- It is an ether with a branched structure (isopropyl group) and a short-to-moderate chain length.
- Ethers in the examples (where comparable) have property values around **-0.4 to -0.7**.
- Branching might slightly increase the value (less negative) compared to linear ethers.
- Given the trends, a reasonable estimate is between **-0.5 and -0.3**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the closest analogs (e.g., **CCOC(=O)CC** = -0.692, **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** = 0.143, and **CCCC(C)(O)CC** = -0.124), **CCCOC(C)C** is likely less negative than a linear ether but still negative. 

**Predicted property value: -0.35** (approximate, based on interpolation of trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data.)

Iteration: 7
SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.39759008869859364
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **dihydropyrimidine-2,4-dione (uracil-like) ring** with substitutions:
   - A **bromine (Br)** substituent (electron-withdrawing, polar).
   - A **methyl (C)** substituent (electron-donating, hydrophobic).
   - A **tert-butyl-like group (CCC(C))** attached to nitrogen (bulky, hydrophobic).
   - Two **carbonyl (C=O)** groups (polar, hydrogen bond acceptors).

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of **Br** and **C=O** groups suggests some polarity, but the bulky **CCC(C)** group adds significant hydrophobicity.
   - Similar molecules in the dataset with **Br** and **C=O** (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` with property **0.288**) show modest positive values.
   - Molecules with **bulky hydrophobic groups** (e.g., `CC(C)CCO` with **-0.828**) tend to have negative values, but this is offset here by the polar Br and C=O.
   - The **uracil-like core** is somewhat analogous to `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3` (property **0.969**), but the substitutions here are less aromatic and more polar/aliphatic.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The closest analog is likely `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (property **0.288**), but with added hydrophobicity from **CCC(C)**.
   - Another partial match is `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)CC=C` (property **0.964**), which has a similar cyclic diamide with hydrophobic substitutions.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between **polar (Br, C=O)** and **hydrophobic (CCC(C))** features, the property value is likely **moderately positive**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.45**  

This reflects the competing effects of the polar groups (pulling the value toward positive) and the bulky hydrophobic group (pulling it toward neutral or slightly negative). The value is interpolated between similar examples in the dataset.

Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.918030299051648
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), we can infer the following trends to predict the property:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, naphthalene) tend to have positive property values unless heavily substituted with electronegative groups (e.g., NO₂, Cl) or polar functional groups (e.g., OH, NH₂), which lower the value.
   - Example: 
     - `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` (a large aromatic system) has a high value of **0.81476148**.
     - `Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C` (methyl-substituted naphthalene-like structure) has **0.78483534**.

2. **Biphenyl-like Structures**:
   - The molecule `Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34` (a nitrogen-substituted polyaromatic) has a value of **-0.73332269**, but the nitrogen and non-linear structure likely contribute to the negative value.
   - The target molecule (biphenyl) is a simpler, symmetric, and purely hydrocarbon aromatic system, so we expect a positive value closer to other unsubstituted aromatics.

3. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Electronegative substituents (e.g., Cl, NO₂, OH) reduce the property value (often to negative values).
   - Hydrocarbon chains or non-polar groups (e.g., alkyl) tend to increase or maintain positive values unless the molecule is small (e.g., `CO` has **-0.82914606**).

### Prediction for Biphenyl:
- Biphenyl is a symmetric, non-polar, purely aromatic hydrocarbon with no electronegative substituents. 
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - `Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C` (methyl-substituted naphthalene-like): **0.78483534**.
  - `C1CCc2ccccc2C1` (aromatic with aliphatic ring): **0.42809271**.
  - The large aromatic system (0.814) suggests extended conjugation increases the value.
- Biphenyl has less conjugation than the large aromatic system but more than a single benzene ring, so the value should be between **0.4 and 0.8**.

### Final Prediction:
A reasonable estimate for **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** is **0.65**. This reflects its symmetric, purely aromatic nature with moderate conjugation. 

**Predicted property value: 0.65**
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.6389681404511427
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, I will analyze the structural features and trends to predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCS** (butyl mercaptan or 1-butanethiol).

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aliphatic Chains**: 
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCC(=C)C**, **CCCCCC(C)C**) tend to have positive property values, often in the range of **0.8–0.9**.
   - Longer or branched aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCC(C)C**, **CC(C)=CCCC(C)=CC(=O)**) can vary but often remain positive unless functionalized with polar groups.

2. **Sulfur-Containing Compounds**:
   - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O**: Contains sulfur and has a high value (**0.9145**).
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: Also sulfur-containing with a value of **0.6759**.
   - **CCc1cccc(C)c1N(C(C)COC)C(=O)CCl**: Contains sulfur (Cl substituent) but has a negative value (**-0.7649**), likely due to other polar groups.
   - **Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1**: Sulfur in a heterocycle with a value of **0.6007**.

3. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Oxygen or nitrogen groups (e.g., **OH**, **C=O**, **N**) can significantly affect the property, often lowering it if the molecule is otherwise nonpolar.
   - **CCCCS** has a thiol group (**-SH**), which is polar but less so than alcohols or carbonyls.

4. **Size and Branching**:
   - Smaller aliphatic chains with simple substituents (e.g., **CC(C)I**) can have negative values, but **CCCCS** is a linear chain with a moderate-sized alkyl group.

### Prediction for **CCCCS**:
- The molecule is a simple aliphatic thiol with no additional polar groups beyond the **-SH**.
- The sulfur atom may slightly increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons, but the effect is not as strong as in more complex sulfur-containing molecules.
- Given the trend for aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCC(=C)C** = **0.8619**, **CCCCCC(C)C** = **-0.0634**), and the presence of sulfur, I would predict a value in the **positive but moderate range**.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CCCCS** is approximately **0.75**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the provided data. If the property is something like logP or a similar descriptor, this value aligns with the hydrophobicity of such a molecule.)
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.12436679882714508
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/LogP Trends**:
   - Molecules with **long aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCC/C=C/C, CCC(C)(C)C)** tend to have **negative or moderately negative values** (e.g., -0.487, -0.786).
   - **Branched alkanes (e.g., CCC(C)(C)C)** often have **negative values** (e.g., -0.786).
   - **Polar groups (e.g., -OH, -COO-, -NH2)** tend to **decrease the property value** (more negative).
   - **Aromatic rings with halogens (e.g., Cl, Br)** often **increase the value** (e.g., 0.880 for Br-substituted aromatics).

2. **Specific Examples Similar to CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
   - **CCCC(C)(O)CC**: Property = **-0.124** (branched alkane with -OH).
   - **CC(C)CC(C)O**: Property = **-0.805** (branched alkane with -OH).
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**: Property = **-0.786** (branched alkane, no polar group).

3. **Effect of -OH Group**:
   - The presence of **-OH** tends to **lower the property value** (more negative). Compare:
     - **CCC(C)(C)C** (no -OH) vs. **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (with -OH): -0.124 is less negative than -0.786, but this depends on branching.

### Analysis of CCCC(C)(C)CO:
- This is a **branched alkane (tert-pentyl group) with a terminal -OH**.
- Similar to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (property = -0.124) but with slightly less branching.
- The -OH group will **reduce the property value**, but the bulky alkyl group may offset this slightly.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarity to **CCCC(C)(O)CC (-0.124)** and **CC(C)CC(C)O (-0.805)**, and considering the balance between branching and polarity, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.45**  

This reflects the **moderate hydrophobicity reduction due to the -OH group** while accounting for the **bulky alkyl structure**.
==================================================
Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.8803830393115536
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is **methyl-dibenzo[a,h]anthracene** (simplified representation: a methyl group attached to a dibenzocyclic structure). It consists of:
- A methyl group (`C`) attached to a fused bicyclic aromatic system (`c1ccc2ccccc2c1`), which is essentially two benzene rings fused together with a methyl substituent.

### Key Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - `Cc1cccc(C)c1C` (two methyl groups on a benzene ring): **-0.42340584**
   - `Cc1ccc(C)c1C` (two methyl groups on a benzene ring): **-0.75981146**
   - `Cc1ccc(C)cc1` (one methyl group on a benzene ring): **-0.29600589**
   - `Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1` (two methyl groups on a benzene ring): **0.76769957**

   The property seems sensitive to the number and position of alkyl groups on aromatic rings. More alkylation tends to increase hydrophobicity (less negative values), but fused rings complicate this.

2. **Fused Aromatic Systems**:
   - `c1ccccc1` (benzene): **-0.71752789**
   - `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (naphthalene with a methyl group): Similar to our target structure.
   - `Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1` (a more complex fused system): **0.2577899**

   Fused rings generally decrease the property value (more negative), but adding alkyl groups can offset this.

3. **Specific Comparison**:
   - Our molecule (`Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1`) is a **methyl-naphthalene** derivative. 
   - Compare to `Cc1cccc(C)c1C` (two methyl groups on benzene): **-0.42340584** and `c1ccccc1`: **-0.71752789**.
   - The methyl group increases the value compared to pure benzene, but the fused ring (naphthalene core) would decrease it further.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between:
- The **fused aromatic system** (naphthalene-like, which would push the value toward ~-0.7 to -0.5),
- The **methyl substituent** (which tends to increase the value by ~0.2-0.3 compared to unsubstituted aromatics),

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.5 and -0.3**. 

Looking at similar structures:
- `Cc1ccc(C)cc1` (methylbenzene): **-0.29600589**
- `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (methylnaphthalene) should be slightly more negative due to the fused ring.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.35** (a compromise between the methyl group's positive contribution and the fused ring's negative effect). 

However, looking at `Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1` (a larger fused system with a methyl group): **0.2577899**, the property seems less negative for larger fused systems with alkylation. Thus, for `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1`, a value closer to **-0.25** might also be plausible.

Given the data, I predict:  
**-0.30** (rounded from the trend). 

But to match the precision of the given examples, let's say:  
**-0.29600589** (same as `Cc1ccc(C)cc1`, as the methyl-naphthalene might behave similarly to methyl-benzene in this property). 

However, the fused ring likely makes it slightly more negative, so a better estimate is:  
**-0.35**. 

But reviewing `Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1` (larger fused system): **0.2577899**, it seems larger fused systems with alkylation have less negative values. Thus, for `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1`, I'll predict:  
**-0.25**. 

### Final Answer:
**-0.25** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The true value could vary slightly depending on the specific property's dependence on structure.)

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 0.8883300874102671
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic imide with two carbonyl groups and two nitrogens. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **-0.78235546**.  
   - The core is polar and likely contributes to negative property values due to hydrogen bonding and dipole interactions.

2. **Substituents**:  
   - The hydantoin core is substituted with a **bulky alkyl group (C(C)CCC)** and a **vinyl group (CC=C)**.  
   - The alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) is moderately hydrophobic, while the vinyl group adds slight polarity/unsaturation.  

3. **Comparison to Examples**:  
   - The closest analog is **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (property = **-0.78235546**).  
   - The additional **C(C)CCC** substituent here adds more hydrophobicity but also steric bulk, which may slightly reduce the magnitude of the negative property value (i.e., make it less negative).  

4. **Other Observations**:  
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., carbonyls, nitrogens) tend to have negative property values (e.g., **-0.78235546**, **-0.65723409**).  
   - Bulky hydrophobic groups (e.g., **CC=C(C(=CC)c1ccc(O)cc1)c2ccc(O)cc2**) can push values toward positive, but the polar core here dominates.  

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarity to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** but with slightly increased hydrophobicity, the property value should be **less negative** but still in the same range.  

**Prediction: -0.70**  

(Note: This is an educated estimate based on structural trends in the provided data. For precise predictions, computational modeling or experimental measurement would be required.)

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.8514862233361791
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), we can infer the following trends to predict the property:

1. **Fluorine Substituents**: 
   - Molecules with halogen substituents (e.g., Cl, Br) tend to have negative property values (e.g., Clc1ccc(I)cc1: -0.296, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl: -0.808). 
   - Fluorine is more electronegative than Cl/Br, but the trifluoromethyl group (CF3) is bulkier and may have a different effect.

2. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., c1ccccc1) with non-polar substituents (e.g., CCc1ccccc1CC: -0.848) tend to have negative values, while polar/electron-withdrawing groups can increase the property (e.g., COC(=O)c1cccnc1: 0.627).

3. **Trifluoromethylbenzene (CF3-Ph)**:
   - The CF3 group is strongly electron-withdrawing but also hydrophobic. 
   - Comparing to similar structures:
     - Clc1ccc(I)cc1: -0.296 (halogen-substituted benzene)
     - CCc1ccc(CC)cc1: 0.958 (alkyl-substituted benzene, positive due to non-polarity)
     - The CF3 group is intermediate in polarity but closer to halogens in electronegativity.

4. **Prediction**:
   - The property is likely slightly negative due to the electronegative CF3 group, but not as negative as heavily halogenated benzenes (e.g., -0.296 for Cl/I-substituted benzene).
   - A reasonable estimate is **~ -0.25**.

### Final Predicted Property Value: **-0.25** (approximate, based on trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.8496239268540904
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar-like polyol (specifically, a hexose sugar derivative with multiple hydroxyl groups), we can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Hydroxyl-rich molecules**: 
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (a linear polyol) has a property value of **-0.77093386**.
   - The given molecule is a cyclic version of a similar polyol (likely a hexose like glucose or mannitol derivative), which should have comparable properties due to the high density of hydroxyl groups.

2. **Polarity and hydrophilicity**: 
   - Molecules with many hydroxyl groups tend to have negative property values in this dataset, indicating a trend toward lower values for highly polar, water-soluble compounds.

3. **Cyclic vs. linear**: 
   - The cyclic structure may slightly increase the property value compared to the linear form due to reduced flexibility, but the effect is likely small given the dominance of the hydroxyl groups.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (-0.77093386) and the slightly more constrained cyclic structure, the predicted property value for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** would be **slightly higher but still in the same range**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: -0.75**  
*(This is a reasonable estimate, likely between -0.70 and -0.80 based on the dataset trends.)*

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: -0.8161336908267796
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size/complexity. The molecule in question is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural features:
1. **Multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)**: The molecule contains several ketone (C=O) and ester (C(=O)O) groups, which are polar and can contribute to higher property values (as seen in similar molecules like CCOC(=O)C with a value of 0.86195361).
2. **Hydroxyl groups (OH)**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (e.g., C3(O) and C(O)) can increase polarity but may also introduce hydrogen bonding, which can lower the property value in some contexts (e.g., OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO has a value of -0.77093386).
3. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a polycyclic (steroid-like) structure with conjugated systems (C=CC=C), which can reduce the property value due to increased hydrophobicity (e.g., CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C has a value of -0.35970715).
4. **Mixed polar/nonpolar regions**: The combination of polar groups (C=O, OH) and nonpolar hydrocarbon rings creates a balance, likely leading to an intermediate property value.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: This is a steroid-like molecule with fewer polar groups and a value of **-0.35970715**.
- **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C**: Another steroid-like molecule with fewer polar groups and a value of **-0.49720134**.
- **CCOC(=O)C**: A simple ester with a value of **0.86195361**.

### Prediction:
The molecule has more polar groups (C=O, OH) than the steroid-like examples but is less polar than simple esters. The conjugated system and size will pull the value down, but the additional polar groups will raise it compared to the steroid-like examples. 

**Predicted property value: -0.25** (intermediate between the steroid-like examples and the simple polar molecules). 

However, given the complexity, a more precise estimate might be closer to **-0.15 to -0.30**. For a single value, I would predict:  
**-0.22**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. The property could be logP, solubility, or another descriptor.)

Iteration: 16
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: -0.8335509730231425
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a polycyclic steroid-like structure with multiple fused rings (tetracyclic or pentacyclic), including a **carbonyl group (C=O)** and a **hydroxyl group (OH)**. This suggests some polarity and hydrogen-bonding capability.
2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Ketone (C=O)**: Present in the ring system (similar to some examples like `CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O` with a high value of **0.899**).
   - **Hydroxyl (OH)**: Attached to one of the rings (similar to `Oc1ccccc1Cl` with a high value of **0.969** or `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` with a value of **-0.281**).
3. **Size and Complexity**: The molecule is large and rigid, which may influence its property. Larger fused-ring systems in the examples show mixed trends (e.g., `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` has **-0.834**, while `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1` has **0.880**).

### Comparison with Examples:
- The presence of both **C=O** and **OH** groups suggests a balance between polar and nonpolar interactions. 
- The steroid-like framework (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` with **-0.281**) is somewhat similar, but our molecule has an additional carbonyl group, which may increase the property value.
- Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` with **-0.150**) tend to have moderate values.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarities to molecules with property values in the **moderate to high range (0.2 to 0.9)**, and considering the balance between the polar (C=O, OH) and nonpolar (fused rings) components, I predict a **moderate positive value**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

This aligns with the influence of the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups while accounting for the size and rigidity of the fused ring system.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.9668554385734924
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH3-CO-NH-)**: Present in the substituent on the benzene ring.
   - **Nitro group (NO2)**: Attached to the benzene ring (represented as N(=O)=O in SMILES).
   - **Benzene ring**: The core structure is a substituted benzene.

2. **Electron-Withdrawing/Directing Effects**:
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing (-I and -M effects), which would polarize the ring and likely influence the property.
   - The acetamide group is moderately electron-withdrawing (due to the carbonyl) but can also donate electrons via resonance (NH group).

3. **Similar Examples**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (nitrobenzene)**: Property = -0.83622204. This is a simple nitrobenzene with no other substituents, and the property is strongly negative.
   - **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (methoxy-nitrobenzene)**: Property = 0.93368232. Here, the methoxy group is electron-donating (+M effect), counteracting the nitro group's effect, leading to a positive property value.
   - **O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12 (nitronaphthalene)**: Property = 0.86424094. The extended aromatic system increases the property value.
   - **CC(=O)NCc1ccccc1 (N-acetyl aniline derivative)**: Not directly in the list, but acetamide substituents are present in other molecules (e.g., CC(=O)NCc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is similar to our target).

4. **Key Observations**:
   - The nitro group tends to decrease the property value (negative contribution) unless balanced by electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy in COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O).
   - The acetamide group is less electron-donating than methoxy but still has some +M effect from the NH. This would partially counteract the nitro group's effect but not as strongly as methoxy.

### Prediction:
The molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has:
- A nitro group (strongly negative contribution).
- An acetamide group (moderate positive contribution, but weaker than methoxy).

Given that nitrobenzene alone is -0.836 and methoxy-nitrobenzene is +0.934, the acetamide-nitrobenzene should lie somewhere between these values. The acetamide is less donating than methoxy, so the property will be less positive than methoxy-nitrobenzene but more than nitrobenzene. 

Looking at similar molecules:
- **O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2**: Property = -0.17928634 (nitro group with other substituents).
- **CC(=O)NCc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: Not in the list, but likely similar to the above.

Given these comparisons, a reasonable estimate is slightly negative or near zero, as the acetamide partially counteracts the nitro group.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: -0.15** (close to zero, slightly negative due to the nitro group dominating slightly over the acetamide). 

This aligns with the trend where electron-withdrawing groups reduce the property and electron-donating groups increase it, with acetamide being a weaker donor than methoxy.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: -0.3706002213397905
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC))**: This is a polar and moderately electronegative group. Similar electronegative groups (e.g., P=O, S=O) in the examples tend to contribute negatively to the property value (e.g., **CSSC** has a value of -0.85201745, and **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** has -0.36124346).
2. **Thiocarbamate linkage (SCn1c(=O)oc2...)**: The presence of sulfur (S) and carbonyl (C=O) groups suggests polarity and potential negative contributions (e.g., **CSSC** is highly negative).
3. **Chlorinated aromatic ring (cc(Cl)ccc12)**: Chlorine substituents on aromatic rings in the examples show mixed effects:
   - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2** has -0.81892957.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** has +0.82827795 (likely due to symmetry/multiple halogens).
   Here, the single Cl may lean toward a negative contribution.
4. **Heterocycle (n1c(=O)oc2...)**: The fused heterocycle with C=O and O (lactone-like) may add slight polarity but is less extreme than pure electronegative groups.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule combines multiple moderately negative contributors (P=S, S-C, Cl, C=O) but no strongly positive features (e.g., no small alkyne like **CC#N** with +0.969).
- Similar complex molecules with polar/electronegative groups (e.g., **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** at -0.85176723) have highly negative values.
- However, the presence of alkyl chains (CCO, OCC) may slightly offset the negativity (e.g., **CCCC(C)O** is -0.82754419).

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of moderately negative groups and lack of strong positive contributors, the property value is likely **negative but not extreme**, similar to other polar/heteroatom-rich molecules in the dataset. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: -0.72**  
*(This aligns with examples like **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (-0.66895175) or **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (-0.36124346), but adjusted for additional electronegative groups.)*

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.8010527672931977
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol) has a property value of **0.36332188**.
   - **CCCCCCC(C)O** (a branched alcohol) has a property value of **0.80320862**.
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (a linear alcohol) has a property value of **-0.45726625**.
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (a polyol) has a property value of **-0.77093386**.

   Branched alcohols (like **CC(C)CO**) tend to have higher (more positive) property values compared to linear or polyols.

2. **Branched vs. Linear Hydrocarbons**:
   - **CCC** (propane) has a property value of **-0.81564338**.
   - **CC(C)C** (isobutane) is not in the examples, but branching generally increases the property value (as seen in alcohols).

3. **Effect of Tertiary Carbon (C with 3 alkyl groups)**:
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** has a tertiary carbon (more branching than **CC(C)CO**), which likely increases the property value further.

### Prediction for **CC(C)(C)CO**:
- This is a more branched version of **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol), with a tertiary carbon (C attached to 3 methyl groups and an alcohol).
- Compared to **CC(C)CO** (0.36332188), the additional branching (**CC(C)(C)CO**) should increase the property value.
- The closest analog is **CCCCCCC(C)O** (0.80320862), which is less branched but has a longer chain. 

Given the strong positive effect of branching, I predict the property value for **CC(C)(C)CO** to be **higher than 0.36332188 but less than 0.80320862**. A reasonable estimate would be around **0.65**.

### Final Answer:
**0.65** (approximate, based on branching trends in the data).

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 0.6801343517605404
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12`, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Heterocyclic Core**: The molecule is a fused bicyclic system with two nitrogen-containing rings (resembling purine-like structures but with an oxygen substituent). 
   - Similar to `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` (property: -0.66258864) and `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` (property: -0.76282947), which are also nitrogen-rich heterocycles with polar substituents (C=O, F, or NH groups).
   - The presence of multiple nitrogens and a carbonyl (C=O) suggests high polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, which often correlates with lower property values in the given dataset.

2. **Polarity and Substituents**:
   - The molecule has two NH groups and a carbonyl, making it highly polar. Polar molecules in the dataset (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1`, property: -0.46277191; `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F`, property: -0.66258864) tend to have negative property values.
   - The lack of hydrophobic groups (e.g., alkyl chains or aromatic rings without polar substituents) further supports a lower value.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` (property: -0.66258864) is structurally similar (nitrogen-rich heterocycle with C=O and NH).
   - `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` (property: -0.76282947) is even closer, with a similar fused ring and NH/C=O groups.
   - The given molecule has an additional fused nitrogen ring, which may increase polarity slightly compared to these examples.

### Prediction:
Given the high polarity, nitrogen-rich fused rings, and similarity to molecules with properties around **-0.66 to -0.76**, a reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` due to the extra NH group and fused ring. 

**Predicted property value: -0.71** (interpolated between the two closest examples). 

This aligns with the trend that highly polar, hydrogen-bonding heterocycles with no hydrophobic regions have negative values in the dataset.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.9570756976340349
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with polar functional groups (e.g., alcohols, esters, amines, halogens) tend to have a range of property values, but no clear trend in polarity alone.
   - Esters (e.g., CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC, -0.41650555) and similar carbonyl-containing compounds often have negative property values.

2. **Branching and Size**:
   - Highly branched alkanes (e.g., CCC(C)(C)C, 0.80105277) tend to have positive values.
   - Linear or less branched molecules with polar groups tend to have negative values.

3. **Specific Examples**:
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a steroid-like molecule with carbonyl groups) has a value of -0.84384501.
   - **CC(=O)O** (acetic acid, not in the list but similar to methyl acetate) is not directly comparable, but esters like **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** have negative values.

4. **Methyl Acetate (CC(C)OC=O)**:
   - This is an ester with a small branched structure (isopropyl group attached to the ester oxygen).
   - Esters in the examples tend to have negative values (e.g., -0.41650555 for CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC).
   - The branching (isopropyl) might slightly increase the value compared to linear esters, but not enough to make it positive.

### Prediction:
Given that esters generally have negative values and the branching here is minimal (just an isopropyl group), the property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is likely in the range of **-0.4 to -0.6**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.52** (similar to other small esters but accounting for slight branching). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.52**

True Property: -0.7385810995348255
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structure and compare it with the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl rings (aromatic groups) attached to the nitrogen atoms of the urea functional group (**-N-C(=O)-N-**). 

Key features:
1. **Aromatic rings (phenyl groups)**: These are present in many of the examples, and their contribution to the property seems context-dependent (e.g., halogenated aromatics tend to have higher values, while plain or substituted aromatics vary).
2. **Urea linkage (-N-C(=O)-N-)**: This is a polar, hydrogen-bonding functional group. Similar amide/urea-like structures in the examples show a range of values, but often moderate to high (e.g., **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** has **0.88878541**, while **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** has **-0.83622204**).

### Comparison with Examples:
- **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1 (0.88878541)**: This has an aromatic ring with an amide/ester-like linkage, similar to our urea derivative. The value is high.
- **NC(=O)c1cccnc1 (-0.83622204)**: This is a smaller amide with a heteroaromatic ring, giving a low value. Our molecule is bulkier and more symmetric.
- **Oc1ccccc1Cl (0.9692727)**: A halogenated aromatic with a high value, but our molecule lacks halogens.
- **c1ccncc1 (-0.71752789)**: A plain heteroaromatic with a low value, but our molecule has more polar groups.

### Prediction:
The urea linkage is polar and can contribute positively, while the two phenyl rings add bulk but no strong electron-withdrawing/donating effects. The symmetry and lack of halogens or strongly polarizing groups suggest a **moderate-high value**, likely between **0.5 and 0.9**. 

Looking at the closest analog (**CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** with **0.88878541**), our molecule is similar but with two phenyl rings instead of substituted aromatics. The value might be slightly lower due to less substitution.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 0.75** (moderate-high, reflecting the urea's polarity and aromatic contributions). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data.)

Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (specifically, fluorene), we can observe the following trends:

1. **Aromaticity and conjugation**: Molecules with extensive aromatic systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatics like `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` with a value of **0.54851634**) tend to have positive property values. Fluorene (the target molecule) is highly aromatic and conjugated, similar to these examples.

2. **Substituents and functional groups**: 
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens, nitro, carbonyl) often reduce the property value (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` has **-0.53212495**).
   - Simple aromatic hydrocarbons without polar substituents (e.g., `CCCCCc1ccccc1`) have high positive values (**0.93986196**).

3. **Size and complexity**: Larger, fused aromatic systems (like the target molecule) tend to have moderate to high positive values, as seen in the examples.

### Prediction:
The target molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (fluorene) is a fused aromatic system with no polar substituents, similar to `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (property value **0.54851634**). However, fluorene is slightly smaller and less conjugated than the latter, so its value may be slightly lower but still positive.

**Predicted property value: ~0.50**  
*(Likely in the range of 0.45 to 0.55, consistent with other polycyclic aromatics in the dataset).*  

### Exact prediction: **0.51**

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -0.04462376777926659
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O))** and **guanidine-like moiety (NC(=N)N)**, both of which are highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding. These groups are likely to increase the property value (as seen in other polar molecules like **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3c2ccc4c5ccccc5ccc43** with a value of -0.28672576, though this is less polar).
   - The **aromatic ring with an amine (N)** further adds polarity and hydrogen-bonding potential.

2. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12** (property: -0.40785498): This has polar amide groups but lacks the sulfonamide and extra amine. Our molecule is more polar, so its value might be higher (less negative).
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property: -0.59338196): This is non-polar except for Cl substituents. Our molecule is far more polar, so its value should be higher.
   - **N-containing polar molecules like CNN** (property: -0.81564338) or **NNc1ccccc1** (property: 0.85508512) show that amines can swing the value significantly. The sulfonamide here is more polar than simple amines.

3. **Sulfonamide Impact**:
   - Sulfonamides (e.g., **CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O**, property: 0.32735344) tend to increase the property value due to their strong polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity. Our molecule has a similar sulfonamide but with additional polar groups (NC(=N)N).

4. **Aromatic System**:
   - The aromatic ring with an amine substituent is similar to **NNc1ccccc1** (property: 0.85508512), but the sulfonamide and guanidine-like group add more polarity.

### Synthesis of Trends:
- The molecule is **highly polar** due to multiple hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors (NC(=N)N, NS(=O)(=O), and aromatic N).
- Sulfonamides and guanidine-like groups tend to **increase the property value** compared to less polar molecules.
- The closest analog is **CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O** (property: 0.32735344), but our molecule is even more polar.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the high polarity and structural similarity to molecules with property values in the **0.3 to 0.8 range**, and considering the additional polar groups, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.45**  

This balances the effects of the sulfonamide (similar to 0.327) and the extra polar NC(=N)N group (pushing it higher). The value is positive due to the strong polarity but not as high as some purely aromatic amines (e.g., 0.855) due to the mixed contributions.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.49426009445949365
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and steric effects. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:**  
`CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O`

### Key structural features:
1. **Two nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`)** – These are strongly electron-withdrawing and polar, likely increasing the property value (positive contribution).
2. **Trifluoromethyl group (`C(F)(F)F`)** – Highly electronegative and electron-withdrawing, likely increasing the property value (positive contribution).
3. **Tertiary amine (`CCN(CC(C)=C)`)** – Moderately polar but less impactful than nitro or CF3 groups.
4. **Alkene (`CC(C)=C`)** – Minimal polarity, likely neutral or slightly negative contribution.
5. **Aromatic ring with substitutions** – The substitutions (nitro and CF3) dominate over the aromaticity.

### Comparison with similar examples:
- `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (property = **0.339**) has one nitro group and a hydroxyl group. The given molecule has two nitro groups and a CF3 group, which are even more electron-withdrawing.
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (property = **0.874**) has two chlorines and a polar amide group. The given molecule has two nitro groups and a CF3, which are similarly or more electron-withdrawing.
- `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl` (property = **0.961**) has multiple chlorines, analogous to the strong electron-withdrawing effects here.

### Prediction:
The combination of **two nitro groups and a CF3 group** suggests a very high property value, likely in the range of **0.8–1.0**. Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.92**  

This is based on the strong electron-withdrawing effects dominating the molecule's behavior, similar to the highest values in the training set.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.9570756976340349
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O**:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - **Ester (COO)**: The molecule has an ester group (R-OC=O), where R is a branched alkyl group (isopropyl, **CC(C)**).
   - **Branched Alkyl Group**: The presence of **CC(C)** (isopropyl) attached to the ester oxygen.

2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **CC(=O)N**: Property = 0.96852723 (amide, highly polar)
   - **CC(C)CCOC=O**: Property = 0.95747746 (ester with branched alkyl, similar to our target)
   - **CCCCCOC(=O)C**: Property = 0.88063015 (linear ester)
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: Property = 0.56311151 (aromatic ester with electron-donating group)
   - **CC(=O)OCC**: Not directly given, but esters with small alkyl groups tend to have positive property values.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Esters (**OC=O**) generally have positive property values in the examples (e.g., 0.957, 0.881, 0.563).
   - Branching (e.g., **CC(C)**) tends to slightly increase the property value compared to linear chains (compare **CC(C)CCOC=O** at 0.957 vs. **CCCCCOC(=O)C** at 0.881).
   - The absence of aromatic rings or electronegative substituents (e.g., Cl, N) simplifies the prediction, as these often reduce the property value.

4. **Prediction**:
   - The molecule **CC(C)OC=O** is structurally very similar to **CC(C)CCOC=O** (property = 0.95747746), but with a shorter alkyl chain (methyl instead of ethyl). Shorter chains typically have slightly higher property values due to reduced hydrophobicity.
   - However, the absence of the extra **CCO** linker might slightly reduce the value compared to **CC(C)CCOC=O**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the similarities to **CC(C)CCOC=O** (0.957) and the slightly simpler structure, a reasonable estimate for **CC(C)OC=O** is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.92** (rounded to two decimal places for clarity). 

This aligns with the trend of esters with small/branched alkyl groups having high positive values in the given examples.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 0.8282779511584331
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is a substituted phenol with the following features:
- A benzene ring with:
  - Two methyl groups (`Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1` implies one methyl at position 1 and another at position 3).
  - A hydroxyl group (`O`) at position 4 (para to the first methyl).
- The formula is **C8H10O**, and the structure resembles **p-cresol** with an additional methyl group (2,4-dimethylphenol).

### Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` (gallic acid methyl ester): Multiple hydroxyl groups → property = 0.3125.
   - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol): Single hydroxyl → property = -0.4628.
   - `Oc2ccc1CCCCc1c2` (tetralin-6-ol): Aliphatic + hydroxyl → property = 0.6640.
   - `c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC` (alkyl-substituted dihydroxybenzene): property = 0.5818.

   Phenols with more hydroxyl groups or aliphatic chains tend to have higher (less negative) property values.

2. **Methyl Substitution**:
   - `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (xylene-like): property = -0.6520 (for `CCc1ccccc1C`).
   - `Cc1cccc(N)c1` (methyl-substituted aniline): property = 0.4636 (due to the amine group).
   - `CCCC(C)(C)C` (branched alkane): property = 0.9138 (highly hydrophobic).

   Methyl groups generally increase hydrophobicity, but the effect depends on the context.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The target molecule has both methyl groups (hydrophobic) and a hydroxyl group (polar). The hydroxyl group will reduce hydrophobicity, while the methyl groups increase it.
   - Comparing to similar molecules:
     - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol): -0.4628.
     - `Cc1ccccc1C` (xylene): likely ~-0.6 to -0.8 (not directly given, but `CCc1ccccc1C` is -0.6520).
     - Adding a hydroxyl to xylene (as in the target) would pull the property toward phenol's value.

### Prediction:
The target molecule is **2,4-dimethylphenol**. Given the balance between:
- Methyl groups (increase hydrophobicity, pushing property toward higher values like xylene).
- Hydroxyl group (decreases hydrophobicity, pulling property toward phenol's -0.4628).

From similar examples, the property likely falls between **-0.3 and 0.2**. A reasonable estimate is slightly higher than phenol due to the two methyl groups but not as high as purely hydrophobic molecules.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1: 0.12**  
(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling would be needed.)

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: -0.23118758284892701
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on structural features.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P(=S)) and Phosphorodithioate (P(=S)(S)) Groups**:
   - Molecules with **COP(=S)(OC)O** or similar phosphorothioate groups tend to have property values around **0.23631807** (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`).
   - The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) in the aromatic ring does not significantly alter the property value for these phosphorothioates.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**:
   - Aromatic rings with **O** (hydroxy) or **Cl** (chloro) substituents often have property values around **0.76769957** (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`).
   - The property value decreases when electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, cyano) or heterocycles (e.g., pyridine) are present.

3. **Thioether (S-C) Groups**:
   - The presence of **SC** (thioether) in the aromatic ring is not explicitly represented in the examples, but sulfur-containing groups (e.g., `S(N)(=O)=O`) appear in molecules with moderate property values (~0.34901953).

4. **Methyl (C) Substituents**:
   - Methyl groups on aromatic rings (e.g., `Cc1ccc(O)c(C)c1`) do not drastically change the property value (still ~0.76769957).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** has:
- A **phosphorothioate group (COP(=S)(OC)O)**, which typically contributes a property value of ~0.23631807.
- An aromatic ring with:
  - A **thioether (SC)** substituent (similar to sulfur-containing groups in other examples).
  - A **methyl (C)** substituent (neutral effect).
- No strongly electron-withdrawing or heterocyclic features.

Given that the phosphorothioate group dominates the property value and the aromatic substituents (SC, C) are not strongly modulating, the property value should be close to the phosphorothioate examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.23631807** (same as the other phosphorothioate examples). 

The slight structural differences (thioether instead of halogens) are unlikely to significantly shift the value given the trends in the data.

Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.8138725705535285
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can observe that the property value tends to increase with the presence of halogens (Cl, Br) and aromatic systems, especially when multiple halogens are attached to aromatic rings. The molecule in question is highly chlorinated with two aromatic rings connected, which is similar to some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` with a value of **0.56395758** and `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` with a value of **0.94957184**).

The given molecule:  
**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**  

has even more chlorines (6 Cl atoms) and a biphenyl-like structure, which suggests a higher value than the first example but likely lower than the highly chlorinated phenol (`Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`), as the latter has an additional oxygen (which seems to increase the property in other examples).  

Comparing to similar structures:  
- The biphenyl-like `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (5 Cl) → **0.56395758**  
- The highly chlorinated `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (4 Cl + O) → **0.94957184**  

This molecule has 6 Cl atoms but no oxygen, so I’d estimate its value to be between these two, likely closer to the higher end due to the additional chlorine.  

### Predicted property value: **~0.75**  
(Plausible range: 0.65–0.85, but leaning toward **0.75** as a reasonable midpoint for this heavily chlorinated biphenyl system.)  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the given examples.)*

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.8619536091407806
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitrate Group (NO2)**: 
   - Molecules with **N(=O)=O** (nitro group) tend to have moderate to high positive property values. For example:
     - `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` → **0.11711952**
     - `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` → **-0.20100966** (note the presence of other groups like CF3 and aromatic rings may lower the value).
   - The nitro group is polar and electron-withdrawing, which often increases the property value unless counteracted by other features.

2. **Alkyl Chains**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., `CCC` → **-0.81564338**) tend to have low (negative) property values.
   - When combined with polar groups, the property value increases. For example:
     - `CC(C)CCOC=O` (aldehyde + alkyl) → **0.95747746**.

3. **Combination of Alkyl and Nitro**:
   - The molecule `CCCN(=O)=O` has a short alkyl chain (**CCC**) and a nitro group (**N(=O)=O**). 
   - The nitro group is likely to dominate the property value, pulling it into the positive range, but the short alkyl chain may limit the magnitude.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (multiple nitro groups on an aromatic ring) → **0.11711952**.
- `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` (nitro + CF3 + aromatic) → **-0.20100966**.
- `CC(C)CCOC=O` (alkyl + aldehyde) → **0.95747746**.

Given that **CCCN(=O)=O** has a nitro group but no aromaticity or other strongly polarizing features, its property value should be positive but not extremely high. 

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate for **CCCN(=O)=O** is **~0.25**. 

This balances the positive contribution of the nitro group with the modest negative contribution of the short alkyl chain. 

---
**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value for **CCCN(=O)=O** is approximately **0.25**.

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.4636115120982231
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogen-Substituted Aromatic Rings**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** has a property value of **-0.29600589**. This is a benzene ring with Cl and Br substituents (meta to each other).
   - **COc1cccc(Cl)c1** (anisole with a Cl substituent) has a value of **-0.67252602**.
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (polychlorinated biphenyl) has a value of **-0.80793742**.
   - **BrC(Br)Br** (bromoform) has a value of **-0.82224909**.

   Halogen substitution (Cl, Br) tends to lower the property value, especially with multiple halogens or heavier halogens (Br > Cl).

2. **Fluorine Substitution**:
   - **Fc1ccc(F)cc1** is not in the dataset, but **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1** (fluorobenzene derivative) has a value of **0.28840686**, suggesting fluorine may have a less negative impact than Cl/Br.
   - Fluorine is less polarizable than Cl/Br, so its effect might be less pronounced.

3. **Combined Halogen Effects**:
   - **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** has both F and Br substituents on the benzene ring. Fluorine is electron-withdrawing but less so than Br, and the Br is likely to dominate the property trend.

4. **Position of Substituents**:
   - The property seems somewhat insensitive to positional isomers (e.g., meta vs. para halogens in the given examples), so the exact position of F and Br may not drastically change the value.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (Cl and Br on benzene) has a value of **-0.29600589**,
- Adding more halogens (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyl) makes the value more negative,
- Fluorine is less negative than Br but still electron-withdrawing,

**Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is expected to have a property value slightly less negative than **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** because F is less electron-withdrawing than Cl, but the Br will still pull the value down. 

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.25 and -0.30**. Given the examples, I predict:

**Predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1: -0.28**  

This is close to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.296)** but slightly less negative due to fluorine's weaker effect compared to chlorine.

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 0.1263049401213687
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/LogP Influence**: 
   - Molecules with **long aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCCBr, CCCCCCCCC(C)O)** tend to have **high positive values (0.6–0.95)**, indicating hydrophobicity.
   - Molecules with **polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NH, -CO, halogens)** often have **lower or negative values**, especially if they dominate the structure.
   - **Aromatic systems** with few polar groups (e.g., CCc1ccc(CC)cc1) have high values (~0.95), while those with polar substituents (e.g., Cl, OH) have lower values.

2. **Steroids and Polycyclic Structures**:
   - The steroid-like molecule **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO** has a **negative value (-0.83)**, likely due to multiple polar groups (OH, C=O, F).
   - Another steroid-like molecule, **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**, has a **positive value (0.88)**, possibly due to fewer polar groups or balanced hydrophobicity.

3. **Specific Functional Groups**:
   - **Alcohols (e.g., CC(C)(C)CO)** have moderate values (~0.80).
   - **Ethers (e.g., CCOCCC)** have values around **0.85**.
   - **Ketones (e.g., CCCCC(=O)C)** have values around **0.92**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(C)O**
- The structure is a **bicyclic hydrocarbon** with:
  - Two **tertiary carbon centers (C1 and C1 with methyl groups)**.
  - One **secondary alcohol (C(O))**.
  - No other polar groups or halogens.
- The molecule is **mostly hydrophobic** due to the aliphatic rings and methyl groups, but the **OH group introduces some polarity**.
- Comparable examples:
  - **CC(C)(C)CO** (0.80): Similar hydrophobic + single OH group.
  - **CC1CCCO1** (0.72): Cyclic ether/alcohol, slightly less hydrophobic.
  - **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2** (-0.38): More polar due to Cl and ester, but shows how polar groups lower the value.

### Prediction:
Given the **balance between hydrophobicity (alkyl groups) and polarity (OH)**, the property value is likely **moderate-positive**, similar to **CC(C)(C)CO (0.80)** but slightly lower due to the cyclic structure. 

**Predicted value: ~0.75** (range: 0.70–0.80). 

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at **CC1CCCO1** (0.72) and **CC(C)(C)CO** (0.80), the target molecule's bicyclic structure and single OH group suggest a value closer to **0.75**.

**Final predicted property value: 0.75** (approximate).

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.8706756123606745
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, aromaticity, functional groups, and halogenation. The molecule in question is:

**CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**

This structure contains:
1. A **phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)**, which is polar and often contributes to negative property values (as seen in similar molecules like `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O)` with a value of `-0.59175658`).
2. An **aromatic ring (c1ccccc1)** fused to a **lactam (N2C(=O)...C2=O)**, which is also polar and often reduces the property value (similar to other lactam-containing molecules in the dataset).
3. **No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2, CF3)** that would push the value toward positive extremes.

Comparing to similar structures:
- The molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` has a value of `-0.59175658`. The current molecule is very similar but lacks the `SC(CCl)` group, which may slightly reduce the negative contribution.
- Other phosphorothioate or lactam-containing molecules in the dataset tend to have negative values in the range of `-0.3` to `-0.8`.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is likely slightly less negative than `-0.59175658` due to the absence of the `SC(CCl)` group. 

**Predicted value: -0.55** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the dataset). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured—e.g., logP, solubility, or a quantum-chemical parameter—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -0.5033852287080856
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like** core (two nitrogen atoms in a 6-membered ring with a carbonyl group, resembling a uracil or hydantoin derivative). 
   - Similar examples: 
     - **CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2** (property = 0.42082416) 
     - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = -0.06961128).
   - These structures with cyclic amides/carbamates tend to have mid-range or slightly positive values.

2. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - The molecule has two fused aromatic systems (a benzene ring and a diazine ring with a carbonyl). 
   - Similar examples: 
     - **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property = 0.63172322) 
     - **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32** (property = -0.85426609).
   - The presence of aromatic rings with polar groups (C=O) tends to push the property toward moderate values.

3. **Substituents**: 
   - Methyl groups (**-CH3**) are attached to the nitrogen and the aromatic system, which are moderately hydrophobic but not extreme. 
   - Similar examples: 
     - **Cc1ccccc1C** (property = -0.42340584) 
     - **Cc1cccc(C)c1C** (property = -0.42340584).

4. **Polarity**: 
   - The carbonyl group (**C=O**) increases polarity, which may lower the property value slightly compared to purely hydrophobic systems (e.g., **CCCC(C)(C)C** with 0.91376676).

### Comparison to Closest Examples:
- The molecule most closely resembles **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property = 0.63172322), which has a similar fused aromatic system with a carbonyl and methyl groups. 
- However, the diketopiperazine-like core here may reduce the property slightly compared to the purely aromatic fused system.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between aromaticity, polarity, and hydrophobic methyl groups, a reasonable estimate is:  
**0.45** (mid-range, slightly positive, similar to cyclic amides with aromatic systems).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.45**

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.0399464543364872
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with **hydrophobic alkyl chains** (e.g., **CCC(=C)C**, **CCCCC**) tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., 0.694, 0.639).
   - Molecules with **polar groups (e.g., -OH, -O-, -Cl, -Br, -I, -N=O, -C=O)** tend to have **negative property values**, especially if multiple polar groups are present (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)CO** has -0.842).
   - **Esters (RCOOR')** show mixed trends:
     - **CCOC(=O)N** (ethyl carbamate) has a high positive value (0.862).
     - **CC(C)OC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate) has a high positive value (0.953).
     - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl nonanoate) has a negative value (-0.796), likely due to the long hydrophobic chain dominating.

2. **Ethyl Hexanoate (CCCCCC(=O)OCC)**:
   - This is an ester with a **6-carbon alkyl chain (hexanoate)** and an **ethoxy group (OCC)**.
   - The hexyl chain is hydrophobic, contributing to a positive property value.
   - The ester group (-COO-) is polar but not as strongly negative as multiple hydroxyls or halogens.
   - Comparing to similar molecules:
     - **CC(C)OC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate) has a value of **0.953**.
     - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl nonanoate) has **-0.796**, but this has a much longer chain.
     - **CCOC(=O)N** (ethyl carbamate) has **0.862**, which is closer in size.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The hexyl chain is shorter than nonanoate but longer than acetate, so the property value should be between **0.8 and 0.95**.
   - The ethoxy group is less polar than an amide (-CONH-) but more polar than a pure hydrocarbon.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, **ethyl hexanoate (CCCCCC(=O)OCC)** likely has a property value of **~0.87**.

### Answer:
**0.87** (approximate, based on structural similarity to examples like isopropyl acetate and ethyl carbamate).

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.6266699834752458
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Esters**: 
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate) has a property value of **0.56311151**.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) has a property value of **-0.43252093**.
   - The presence of an electron-donating group (e.g., -OH) on the aromatic ring seems to increase the property value compared to unsubstituted aromatic esters.

2. **Methyl vs. Ethyl Esters**:
   - Methyl esters (e.g., **COC(=O)c1cncn1C(C)c2ccccc2**) tend to have slightly higher property values than ethyl esters when other substituents are similar, but this is not a strict rule.

3. **Unsubstituted Aromatic Esters**:
   - The unsubstituted ethyl benzoate (**CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**) has a value of **-0.43252093**.
   - Methyl benzoate (**COC(=O)c1ccccc1**) is structurally similar but with a methyl group instead of an ethyl group. Given the trend that methyl esters are often slightly higher, we might expect a value slightly less negative or closer to zero than ethyl benzoate.

4. **Other Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic systems without polar groups (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2**) have positive values (~0.4-0.8), but the presence of an ester group tends to reduce the property value unless balanced by other substituents.

### Prediction for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1**:
- This is methyl benzoate, an unsubstituted aromatic methyl ester. 
- Compared to ethyl benzoate (**-0.43252093**), the methyl analog might have a slightly higher (less negative) value due to the shorter alkyl chain.
- A reasonable estimate would be slightly above **-0.4**, perhaps around **-0.35 to -0.25**.

However, looking at the examples more carefully:
- The only direct comparison is ethyl benzoate (**-0.43252093**) vs. methyl benzoate (no exact example). 
- Without additional data, the safest approach is to assume the property is similar to ethyl benzoate but slightly less negative due to the smaller alkyl group.

### Final Prediction:
Given the uncertainty and lack of exact matches, I will predict a value close to ethyl benzoate but slightly higher:  
**Predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1: -0.40**.  

(Note: If forced to pick a specific number from the given examples, I would lean toward **-0.43252093** or slightly higher, e.g., **-0.40**, but the exact value cannot be precisely determined without more data.)  

---  
**Answer**: The predicted property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is approximately **-0.40**.  

(If you have additional examples or constraints, the prediction could be refined further.)

Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.8274653059047649
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons with Conjugation or Double Bonds**:
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene-like structure): Property = **-0.78792875**
   - **CC/C=C/C** (butene-like structure): Property = **-0.80359215**
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): Property = **-0.75179298**
   - **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane): Property = **0.42163789**

   Hydrocarbons with double bonds (alkenes) or conjugation tend to have negative property values, while saturated hydrocarbons (e.g., cyclopentane) can have positive values.

2. **Conjugated Dienes**:
   - The molecule **C=CCC=C** is a conjugated diene (1,3-butadiene), which has two double bonds separated by a single bond. This conjugation is a key feature.
   - From the examples, conjugated systems (e.g., styrene, butene) have negative values, but none are exact matches for 1,3-butadiene.

3. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - **CC/C=C/C** (butene): Property = **-0.80359215**
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): Property = **-0.78792875**
   - **C=CCC=C** (butadiene) has more conjugation than butene but less aromaticity than styrene. Its property value should likely fall between these two, possibly slightly more negative due to increased conjugation.

4. **Trend for Conjugation**:
   - More conjugation (or unsaturation) tends to push the property value more negative (e.g., **CC/C=C/C** is more negative than **CCCc1ccccc1**).
   - 1,3-Butadiene is more conjugated than butene but less than aromatic systems, so its value should be more negative than butene but not as extreme as some aromatic systems.

### Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **C=CCC=C** should be slightly more negative than **CC/C=C/C** (-0.80359215) but not drastically so. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: -0.85**

This aligns with the trend that increased conjugation leads to more negative values, and 1,3-butadiene is a classic conjugated diene.

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: -0.8222490856608722
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobenzene derivative): **0.43536631**
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene): **0.88038304**
   - **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (chloronaphthalene): **0.88038304**
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (halogenated alkane): **0.19539955**
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl**: **-0.53212495**
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: **-0.29600589**

   Halogenated aromatic compounds (e.g., bromonaphthalene, chloronaphthalene) tend to have high positive values (~0.88), while highly halogenated aliphatic compounds (e.g., FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br) have lower positive values (~0.20). Overly chlorinated aliphatics or aromatics can have negative values.

2. **Brominated Aliphatics**:
   - **BrC(Br)Br** is a fully brominated aliphatic compound (similar to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** but with more bromines). 
   - The presence of multiple heavy halogens (Br) likely reduces the property value compared to aromatic halogenated compounds but may still be slightly positive due to the polarizability of bromine.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (mixed halogens): **0.19539955**
   - **BrC(Br)Br** is even more brominated, which might slightly increase the value due to bromine's polarizability, but the aliphatic nature keeps it modest.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Highly brominated aliphatics are less positive than aromatic halogenated compounds but more positive than highly chlorinated aliphatics.
- **BrC(Br)Br** is analogous to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** but with bromines replacing fluorines/chlorine, likely increasing the value slightly.

A reasonable estimate for **BrC(Br)Br** is **~0.25**. 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br: 0.25**

Iteration: 39
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.591756582722933
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, aromaticity, halogenation, functional groups, and molecular size/complexity. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:**  
`CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`

### Key structural features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (`P(=S)(OCC)`):** Present in some of the examples (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` with property **0.75731512**). This group tends to increase the property value.
2. **Aromatic ring (`c1ccccc1`):** Aromaticity is common in many examples, with varying effects depending on substituents.
3. **Chlorine substitution (`C(CCl)`):** Halogens like chlorine often decrease the property value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has **-0.59338196**), but here it is part of a larger functionalized structure.
4. **Lactam/imide group (`N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`):** Similar to `NC(=O)N` or `C(=O)N(C)C` groups in the examples, which can contribute positively or negatively depending on context.
5. **Ethoxy groups (`CCO` and `OCC`):** These are polar but not strongly influential on their own.

### Comparison with similar examples:
- The molecule `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property **0.75731512**) shares the `P(=S)(OC)` group and has aromatic + halogenated components. Our molecule is more complex with an additional lactam ring and ethoxy groups.
- The molecule `CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O` (property **0.93281301**) has a lactam-like structure (`C1=O`) and aromatic + halogenated parts, similar to our molecule.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of the phosphorothioate group, aromaticity, lactam, and chlorine substitution, the property value is likely in the **higher positive range**, similar to the examples above. The additional complexity (lactam + ethoxy groups) may push the value slightly higher than `0.75731512` but not as high as `0.93281301`.

**Predicted property value:** **~0.85** (approximate, based on structural similarity to the examples).  

For specificity, I would estimate:  
**Predicted value: 0.87** (between the two closest examples).

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.3000981473206187
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group contributions (e.g., nitro groups, carbonyls, halogens, etc.). The property appears to be a quantitative measure influenced by these structural attributes, possibly resembling a calculated or experimental descriptor like logP (lipophilicity), solubility, or a similar physicochemical parameter.

### Analysis of the target molecule:
**CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**

Breaking it down:
1. **Polar/hydrogen-bonding groups**:
   - Tertiary amide (`N(C)C=O`) – contributes negatively (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)C` has -0.558).
   - Urea-like fragment (`C(=O)N`) – likely negative contribution.
   - Chloro-substituted aromatic ring (`c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)`) – chloro groups can vary but often slightly positive or neutral.
   - Heterocycle (`n2nc(oc2=O)`) – polar and likely negative (similar to nitro or other electron-withdrawing groups).
   - Bulky tert-butyl group (`C(C)(C)C`) – hydrophobic, likely positive.

2. **Comparable examples**:
   - `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` has -0.793 (due to two polar amides).
   - `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` has -0.361 (aromatic + amine).
   - `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has -0.684 (chloro + nitro).
   - `CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O` has -0.691 (multiple polar groups).

3. **Net effect**:
   - The molecule has a polar amide, chloro, and a heterocycle with a carbonyl, but also a bulky hydrophobic group. The polar groups likely dominate, giving a moderately negative value.

### Predicted property value:
Given the balance of polar and hydrophobic features, the predicted value is **-0.72** (similar to molecules with multiple polar/electron-withdrawing groups). 

**Final answer: -0.72**

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: -0.8539840422184796
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Chlorine (Cl)**:
   - Molecules with multiple Cl substituents tend to have higher property values (e.g., `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has a value of **0.94957184**).
   - The Cl atoms seem to contribute positively to the property, especially when present in aromatic rings.

2. **Aromatic Systems with Oxygen (O)**:
   - Phenolic (OH) groups on aromatic rings often lower the property value (e.g., `Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1` has **-0.61511179**).
   - However, when combined with Cl, the effect can be mixed or dominated by Cl.

3. **Symmetry and Multiple Substitutions**:
   - Symmetric molecules with multiple Cl or Br substituents (e.g., `BrC(Br)Br` has **-0.82224909**, but this is bromine) tend to have extreme values.
   - The given molecule has **three Cl atoms and two phenolic OH groups**, which suggests a balance between Cl's positive contribution and OH's negative contribution.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **0.76769957** (two Cl and one OH).
   - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` has **-0.81892957** (two Cl, but fused aromatic system).
   - The molecule in question is like two `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` units linked by an oxygen bridge, with an extra Cl.

### Prediction:
The molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** has:
- Three Cl atoms (strong positive contribution).
- Two OH groups (moderate negative contribution).
- A symmetric, biphenyl-like structure with an oxygen linker (may slightly reduce the property due to increased flexibility).

Given the high Cl count and symmetry, the property value should be **higher than 0.76769957** (from `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl`) but not as extreme as `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (0.94957184). 

### Final Prediction:
**0.85** (estimated based on the balance of Cl and OH effects). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. The actual value could vary slightly depending on the property's specific dependence on these features.)

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.8035921451270219
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property value seems to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, and structural complexity. 

The molecule `CC/C=C\C` is **trans-2-pentene**, a simple alkene with a trans double bond. Comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. `CC/C=C/C` (likely **cis-2-pentene**) has a property value of **-0.80359215**.
2. `CCCC(=O)CCCC` (a ketone) has a value of **0.59235312**.
3. `CCCCCC` (hexane) is not in the dataset, but longer alkanes like `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` have values around **-0.76318324**.

The presence of the double bond in `CC/C=C\C` (trans) is structurally similar to `CC/C=C/C` (cis), and the property value is likely close due to similar electronic and steric effects. The trans configuration might slightly alter the value compared to cis, but the difference is likely small.

### Predicted property value for `CC/C=C\C`:  
**Approximately -0.80** (similar to `CC/C=C/C`).  

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**-0.81** (slightly lower due to the trans configuration being less polar than cis).  

However, since the dataset does not explicitly distinguish cis/trans effects, the value is likely very close to the cis form. Thus:  
**Predicted value: -0.80** (same as `CC/C=C/C` within uncertainty).  

### Final answer:  
**-0.80** (rounded from -0.80359215 for consistency with the cis form).

Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.7157240169116496
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOCC** (1,2-diethoxyethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - Molecules with ether linkages tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative. For example:
     - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2**: 0.16325978
     - **COc1ccccc1O**: -0.65198817 (also has phenolic -OH, which may lower the value)
     - **COc1ccccc1O**: -0.65198817 (same as above)
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**: -0.43252093 (ester, but still ether-like)
   - Ethers without strongly polar or functionalized groups often have values near zero.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Linear alkanes or simple ethers (e.g., **CC(C)O**: -0.82224909) tend to have negative values, but symmetric or less polar ethers like **CCCOCC** may have values closer to zero.
   - The molecule **CCCOCC** is symmetric and has no strongly polar or electronegative substituents (like halogens or carbonyls), which would otherwise lower the value.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCC(O)CC**: 0.56947218 (this is a linear alcohol, more polar than **CCCOCC**)
   - **CC(C)COC(=O)C**: 0.00015192 (ether + carbonyl, but the carbonyl dominates)
   - **CCCOCC** is less polar than alcohols but more symmetric than branched ethers.

### Prediction:
Given the symmetry and lack of strongly polar groups, **CCCOCC** is likely to have a property value slightly above zero but not as high as alcohols or carbonyl-containing compounds. A reasonable estimate would be close to the ether examples, perhaps slightly higher due to symmetry.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCOCC** is **0.12**. 

This aligns with the trend of symmetric, non-polar ethers having values near zero (e.g., **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2**: 0.16325978) but without additional polar groups to push it higher.

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.8285393605448249
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **urea-like fragment** (N-C(=O)-N) with two aromatic rings (phenyl groups) attached to the nitrogen atoms. One phenyl group is substituted with a bulky tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)), and the other is part of a dimethylaniline-like structure (N attached to a phenyl ring with a methyl group).
2. **Polarity/Functional Groups**: 
   - The **urea group (N-C(=O)-N)** is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (as an acceptor).
   - The **tert-butyl group** is bulky and hydrophobic.
   - The **dimethylaniline-like moiety** adds some hydrophobicity but also weak polarity due to the nitrogen lone pair.
3. **Aromaticity**: Two phenyl rings contribute to hydrophobicity but can also engage in π-π stacking or weak polar interactions.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Similar molecules with urea/carbamate groups**:
  - `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` has a property value of **-0.85176723**. This molecule has a polar urea-like group and aromatic rings but also includes a thiazole ring, which may increase polarity slightly.
  - `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23` has a property value of **-0.84439028**. This is a cyclic urea with hydrophobic aliphatic groups.
- **Bulky hydrophobic groups**:
  - `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (two phenyl rings with an aliphatic linker) has a value of **-0.77928883**.
  - `Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13` (polyaromatic with methyl groups) has a value of **-0.10984982**.

### Key Observations:
1. Urea/carbamate-like structures with aromatic rings tend to have **negative property values** (around -0.8 to -0.4).
2. Bulky hydrophobic groups (like tert-butyl) reduce polarity but don't necessarily push the value to the extremes seen in purely aliphatic or highly polar molecules.
3. The dimethylaniline-like moiety adds slight hydrophobicity but not as much as purely aliphatic chains.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the polar urea group and the bulky hydrophobic tert-butyl + aromatic rings, the property value is likely in the **moderately negative range**, similar to other urea-containing aromatic compounds in the examples. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.79** (close to values like -0.78931209 or -0.84439028 for similar structures).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is **-0.79**.

The molecule is **N-(4-bromophenyl)acetamide**, with the following features:
1. **Aromatic ring (benzene)**: Present in many examples, often associated with negative values unless modified by other groups.
2. **Bromine substituent (Br)**: Seen in examples like `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` (0.46361151) and `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (-0.29600589). Bromine alone doesn't consistently push the value in one direction.
3. **Amide group (N-C=O)**: Present in molecules like `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (0.82853936) and `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (-0.67031165). Amides can have varying effects, but in this case, the acetamide group is less bulky and may not dominate.
4. **Substitution pattern**: The Br and amide are para to each other, which may reduce steric effects compared to ortho-substituted examples.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` has a property value of **-0.29600589**. This is a phenol with a para-Br substituent.
- `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` (para-methylaniline) has a value of **-0.29600589**, identical to the phenol-Br case, suggesting the Br and NH2 have similar effects here.
- `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (bulky amide) has a high positive value (0.82853936), but this is likely due to the bulky tert-butyl and additional aromatic rings.

### Prediction:
The target molecule is structurally closest to `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` and `Cc1ccc(N)cc1`, both with a value of **-0.29600589**. The amide group in the target is less electron-donating than OH or NH2 but still somewhat polar. The Br substituent's effect seems to balance out, leading to a similar value.

However, the amide (N-C=O) is slightly more electron-withdrawing than OH or NH2, which might push the value slightly more negative. But given the consistency of the -0.296 value for the two comparable examples, I predict the property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** will be close to this, perhaps slightly lower.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.30** (rounded from -0.29600589 for consistency with the observed trend). 

For precision, I'll retain the exact value from the closest match:
**-0.29600589** (same as `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` and `Cc1ccc(N)cc1`). 

This is based on the assumption that the amide's effect is similar to OH/NH2 in this context.

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.4315819306342764
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings (e.g., benzene)**: 
   - Simple alkyl-substituted aromatics (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1N**, **N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**) tend to have high positive values (~0.9–0.97). 
   - Aromatics with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**, **Brc1ccccc1**) have negative values (~ -0.3 to -0.46).
   - Aromatics with neutral or weakly donating alkyl groups (e.g., **CCc1ccc(C)cc1**) have modest positive values (~0.17).

2. **Branched Aliphatic Chains**:
   - Branched alkanes (e.g., **CC(C)CO**, **CC(C)CCO**) tend to have negative values (~ -0.36 to -0.83).
   - Cyclic alkanes (e.g., **CC1CCCCC1**) have high positive values (~0.89).

3. **Combination of Aromatic and Aliphatic**:
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene-like) has a negative value (-0.79).
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethylbenzene-like) has a modest positive value (0.17).
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropylbenzene-like) has a slightly negative value (-0.04).

### Analysis of **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**:
- This is **isobutylbenzene**, with a branched aliphatic chain (**CC(C)C-**) attached to a benzene ring.
- The branched chain (**CC(C)C-**) is similar to **CC(C)CCO** (property = -0.827) and **CC(C)CCCO** (property = -0.626), suggesting a negative contribution.
- The benzene ring alone (no substituents) would likely contribute positively, but the branched alkyl group reduces this effect.
- Comparable molecules:
  - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethylbenzene-like): 0.17
  - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropylbenzene): -0.04
  - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): -0.79

Given the branched chain (**CC(C)C-**), the property is likely slightly negative but less so than **C=Cc1ccccc1** (due to no double bond) and closer to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (-0.04). 

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate is **~ -0.15 to -0.25**. 

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**-0.20** (interpolating between similar structures). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.7879287523641155
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural and functional group patterns that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Polar Substituents**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): **0.9226**
   - **COc1ccccc1** (methoxybenzene): **0.8551**
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (phenol + nitro): **0.3391**
   - These suggest that polar substituents (e.g., -OH, -OCH3, -NO2) on aromatic rings tend to increase the property value.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Carbonyl Groups**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): **0.9226**
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (imide): **-0.0095**
   - The presence of a carbonyl (C=O) directly attached to the aromatic ring (as in benzaldehyde) is not explicitly shown in the examples, but aldehydes are polar and electron-withdrawing.

3. **Non-Polar or Weakly Polar Aromatic Systems**:
   - **Cc1cccc2c(C)cccc12** (methyl-substituted naphthalene): **-0.7345**
   - **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (methyl-substituted biphenyl): **-0.3612**
   - These have lower (negative) property values due to lack of strong polar groups.

4. **Benzaldehyde-Like Structures**:
   - The closest example is **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol, **0.9226**), where the carbonyl is part of an amide. A standalone aldehyde (benzaldehyde) is less polar than an amide but more polar than plain aromatic hydrocarbons.

### Prediction for **O=Cc1ccccc1**:
- Benzaldehyde has a polar aldehyde group (-CHO) attached to a benzene ring. This is less polar than an amide or phenol but more polar than plain aromatic hydrocarbons or alkyl-substituted aromatics.
- Comparing to the examples:
  - **COc1ccccc1** (methoxybenzene, **0.8551**) is somewhat similar in polarity (ether vs. aldehyde).
  - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol, **0.9226**) is more polar.
  - **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (methyl-substituted biphenyl, **-0.3612**) is much less polar.
- The aldehyde group is electron-withdrawing but not as strongly polar as -OH or -NO2.

Given these observations, the property value for **O=Cc1ccccc1** is likely **between 0.5 and 0.8**. A reasonable estimate is **~0.75**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for O=Cc1ccccc1: 0.75**
==================================================
Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.20521673361739304
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:**  
`O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2`

### Key structural features:
1. **Nitro group (`N(=O)=O`):** Present in the molecule (attached to the aromatic ring). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have positive property values (e.g., `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` has 0.417, `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2` has -0.813, but the latter is a fused heterocycle with different properties).
2. **Aromatic ring with heteroatoms:** The molecule contains a furan-like ring (`o1`) and a nitro-substituted aromatic system. Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro) often have positive property values in the examples.
3. **Amide/carbamate-like groups (`O=C2CN...C(=O)N2`): The molecule has a cyclic urea/amide-like structure. Similar structures in the examples (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` with 0.829) suggest positive contributions.
4. **Polarity and hydrogen bonding:** The presence of multiple polar groups (nitro, amide) suggests moderate to high polarity, which in the examples often aligns with positive property values.

### Comparison with similar examples:
- `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` (0.417): Nitro group + aromatic + ether linkage.
- `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (0.829): Amide + aromatic.
- `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2` (-0.813): Fused heterocycle (negative, but structurally dissimilar).

The given molecule is more similar to the first two (nitro + amide + aromatic), but the cyclic urea/amide core may slightly reduce the property value compared to purely aromatic systems.

### Predicted property value:
Given the above analysis, the predicted property value for `O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2` is approximately **0.35**. This is slightly lower than the first example due to the cyclic amide core but still positive due to the nitro group and aromaticity. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the provided data.)

Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.7792888260940469
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **-0.46277191**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene-like structure) has a property value of **0.9327068**.
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but with a single bond between the nitrogens instead of a double bond. This difference likely reduces the conjugation and electron delocalization, leading to a slightly lower property value.

2. **Impact of Nitrogen Connectivity**:
   - The presence of two aromatic rings connected via a nitrogen-nitrogen single bond (hydrazine-like linker) suggests moderate electron delocalization, but not as strong as in the azobenzene case (where the N=N double bond enhances conjugation).

3. **Comparison with Other Examples**:
   - The property value for **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is **0.9327068**, which is quite high due to the extended conjugation.
   - For **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, the lack of full conjugation (due to the N-N single bond) would likely result in a lower value, but still positive due to the aromatic systems.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** but with reduced conjugation, the property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is expected to be slightly lower but still in the positive range. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.85**  

This is based on:
- The high value for the azobenzene-like structure (0.93).
- The reduction due to the N-N single bond (less conjugation).
- The presence of two aromatic rings still contributing positively to the property. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)

Iteration: 50
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -0.8546589037528991
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure (cyclohexane-like ring, **CCCC1**). 
   - It is a bicyclic system with two fused rings: a cyclohexane and a diketopiperazine-like ring (formed by the two amides).

2. **Similarity to Examples**:
   - The molecule **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = **-0.67031165**) is structurally similar, as it also contains a cyclic diamide (diketopiperazine) core. The main difference is the substituents (here, a cyclohexane ring vs. a linear alkyl chain in the example).
   - The molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = **-0.06961128**) also shares similarities, with a cyclic diamide and alkyl substituents.

3. **Polarity and Hydrophobicity**:
   - The two amide groups introduce polarity, but the cyclohexane ring adds hydrophobicity. This balance suggests a moderately negative property value, similar to other cyclic diamides in the dataset.

4. **Size and Complexity**:
   - The molecule is medium-sized (not as large as some polycyclic examples with very negative values) but more complex than simple linear amides.

### Prediction:
Given the similarities to cyclic diamides in the dataset (which tend to have property values between **-0.67** and **-0.07**), and considering the slightly more hydrophobic nature of the cyclohexane ring (which may reduce the absolute value compared to purely polar diamides), a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.45**  

This aligns with the trend where cyclic diamides with alkyl substituents have moderately negative values, and the cyclohexane ring pushes it slightly toward less negative values compared to purely polar analogs.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.3839347292226128
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl  
**Structure:** This is a biphenyl derivative with three chlorine substituents (two on one ring and one on the other). 

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Chlorinated aromatic compounds** tend to have high positive property values:
   - Clc1ccccc1Cl (dichlorobenzene) → 0.9692727
   - Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (hexachlorinated biphenyl-like) → 0.96938718
   - Cc1ccccc1N (methylaniline) → 0.9692727 (note: this is not chlorinated, but simple aromatic substitution often gives high values).
   - Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) → Implicitly high (not in examples, but similar to dichlorobenzene).

2. **Biphenyl systems** with halogens:
   - The biphenyl core with multiple chlorines (like the given molecule) is structurally similar to the third example above (Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl), which has a very high value (0.96938718).

3. **Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl)** on aromatic rings seem to correlate with higher property values, especially when multiple halogens are present.

### Prediction:
The given molecule (Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl) is a trichlorinated biphenyl, which is very similar to the hexachlorinated biphenyl-like example (property = 0.96938718). While it has fewer chlorines, the biphenyl core and halogen substitution pattern suggest a similarly high value. 

**Predicted property value: 0.969** (likely very close to the other chlorinated biphenyl example, e.g., ~0.9693). 

### Exact prediction:
Given the consistency in the examples for chlorinated aromatics, the value should be **~0.9693**. 

Thus, the predicted property for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is:  
**0.9693** (rounded to 4 decimal places).

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.9584178707130144
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Alkyl Substituents**: 
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (toluene derivative) has a property value of **0.9692727**.
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene) has a property value of **0.93986196**.
   - These molecules share a benzene ring with alkyl substituents, and their property values are high (~0.9 to 0.97).

2. **Symmetry and Substituent Length**:
   - The molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is symmetric with two ethyl groups (similar to hexylbenzene but with shorter substituents).
   - Symmetric substitution tends to slightly lower the property value compared to single long alkyl chains (e.g., hexylbenzene).

3. **Polarity and Functional Groups**:
   - The absence of polar groups (like -NO2, -OH, -CO) in **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** suggests it is purely hydrophobic, similar to hexylbenzene and toluene derivatives.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (0.93986196) and **Cc1ccccc1N** (0.9692727), but with shorter and symmetric substituents, the property value for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is expected to be slightly lower than hexylbenzene but still in the high range.

**Predicted Property Value: 0.92** (approximate, likely between 0.90 and 0.94). 

### Exact Prediction:
After closer inspection, the symmetric diethyl substitution likely places it very close to **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (0.93986196), so a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.93**

Iteration: 53
SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 0.3490195282161456
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWGs)** like nitro (**N(=O)=O**), sulfonyl (**S(=O)(=O)**), and halogens (**Cl, Br**) tend to decrease the property value (more negative). For example:
   - **CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(C)C)N(=O)=O** (two nitro groups): **-0.83599537**
   - **ClCBr**: **-0.81564338**
   - **Brc1cccc(Br)c1** (two bromines): **0.46361151** (less negative due to aromaticity balancing the effect).

2. **Electron-Donating Groups (EDGs)** like alkyl groups (**CH3, C2H5**) or methoxy (**OCH3**) tend to increase the property value (less negative or positive). For example:
   - **COC(=O)C**: **0.69483157** (methoxy and carbonyl).
   - **CCCCCCCC(=O)C**: **0.79445736** (long alkyl chain + carbonyl).

3. **Aromatic Systems** with substitutions:
   - Simple aromatics like **Cc1ccccc1**: **-0.46277191**.
   - Aromatics with EWGs (e.g., nitro) push the value more negative:
     - **Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O**: **-0.55216368**.
   - Aromatics with EDGs (e.g., alkyl) push the value less negative:
     - **Cc1ccc(C)cc1**: **-0.29600589**.

4. **Sulfonamide/Sulfonyl Groups**:
   - The molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** contains a sulfonamide group (**S(N)(=O)=O**), which is strongly electron-withdrawing. This is similar to nitro groups in effect but may be slightly less negative due to the amine nitrogen's lone pair (partial donation).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (nitroaniline): **-0.68478991**.
  - The sulfonamide group in **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is similarly electron-withdrawing but slightly less so than a nitro group due to resonance effects from the nitrogen lone pair.
- **Oc1cccc2cccnc12** (heteroaromatic with OH): **-0.36124346**.
  - The sulfonamide is more electron-withdrawing than OH, so we expect a more negative value.

### Prediction:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonamide group and the aromatic system, the property value should be moderately negative, similar to nitroaniline but slightly less negative due to the sulfonamide's resonance effects. 

**Predicted value: -0.65** (approximately between -0.68478991 and -0.55216368). 

### Refined Estimate:
- The sulfonamide is slightly less electron-withdrawing than a nitro group, so adjust the value slightly higher (less negative) than nitroaniline (-0.68478991).
- The presence of the amine (**NH2**) also donates electrons, partially offsetting the sulfonamide's effect.

**Final predicted value: -0.62**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is **-0.62**.

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: -0.8532368812201285
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings, forming a **tetracene-like or chrysene-like structure**. It can be represented as:

```
      4
    /   \
1---2     3
    \   /
      5
```
(Simplified representation of the fused rings, where numbers indicate ring positions.)

### Key Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (property: -0.53968798): A PAH with multiple fused rings (likely a phenanthrene derivative with substitutions).
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (property: 0.87785183): A larger PAH (likely a pentacene or similar), which has a positive property value.
   - **Sc2nc1ccccc1s2** (property: 0.25644295): A thiophene-based aromatic system with a positive value.
   - **c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1** (property: 0.76769957): A heavily brominated benzene with a high positive value.

2. **Non-Aromatic/Aliphatic Systems**:
   - **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane, property: 0.42163789) and **C1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexane, property: -0.28209221) show that even simple aliphatic rings can have varying property values.

3. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Halogens (Cl, Br) and electronegative groups (NO2, SO) tend to push the property toward positive or negative values depending on the context. For example:
     - **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (property: -0.30390421) vs. **c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1** (property: 0.76769957).

### Prediction for **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**:
- This is a **fully conjugated, planar, and symmetric PAH** with no heteroatoms or substituents. 
- Larger PAHs in the given examples (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54**) tend to have **positive property values**, likely due to extended π-electron delocalization.
- The absence of electronegative substituents (like Cl or Br) suggests the property is not heavily skewed toward negative values.
- The symmetry and size of the system resemble the **0.87785183** example (pentacene-like), but with one fewer ring, so the value might be slightly lower.

### Final Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** is approximately **0.65**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the provided data. The actual property might depend on the specific nature of the property being measured, such as solubility, polarity, or a computed descriptor like logP or molecular polarizability.)

Iteration: 55
SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: -0.6621780126488167
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, and functional group contributions (e.g., hydroxyl groups, halogens, carbonyls, etc.). The molecule in question is:

**Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)**: The molecule has four hydroxyl groups, which are highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding. In the examples, molecules with multiple -OH groups (e.g., `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.84962393), suggesting a strong contribution to hydrophilicity or polarity.
2. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings, which can contribute to π-π interactions. Aromaticity alone doesn't seem to dominate the property (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45` has -0.56007186), but combined with polar groups, the effect is nuanced.
3. **Ether linkage (Oc1c2)**: The ether bridge is moderately polar but less impactful than -OH.
4. **Carbonyl group (C=O)**: The ketone group adds polarity but is less polar than -OH.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The molecule `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl` has two aromatic rings, polar groups (-OH, Cl), and a property value of -0.66266114.
- The molecule `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (sorbitol-like) has multiple -OH groups and a value of -0.84962393.
- The molecule `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (catechol) has two -OH groups and a value of 0.46361151, but this is an outlier compared to other polyhydroxy examples.

Given the four -OH groups and aromaticity, the property value is likely negative (similar to polyhydroxy compounds in the examples). However, the presence of conjugated systems (aromatic + carbonyl) might slightly offset this. 

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong polarity from the -OH groups and the aromatic/carbonyl contributions, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.720** (close to values like -0.72187153 for `CCCCC(C)(O)CC` or -0.81564338 for `ClCCl`, but adjusted for higher polarity). 

For higher precision, I'd lean toward **-0.75 to -0.80**, but based on the examples, a specific prediction is:  
**-0.785** (interpolating between polyhydroxy and aromatic examples). 

However, observing that `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (catechol) has a positive value (0.46361151) despite two -OH groups, while larger polyhydroxy aromatics like `OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5` have a high positive value (0.8989542), the property might not be strictly hydrophilicity but another metric (e.g., solubility parameter, partition coefficient, or electronic property). 

Given the complexity, the safest bet is:  
**-0.68** (similar to `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl` but adjusted for more -OH groups). 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: -0.68**
==================================================
Iteration: 56
SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 0.5363732801385849
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., P=O, P=S)**:
   - Molecules with phosphate/thiophosphate groups (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) tend to have **moderate positive values (~0.2–0.5)**.
   - The presence of **P=O** (as in `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) gives a value of **0.4524855**, while **P=S** (as in `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) gives **0.23631807**. This suggests P=O may contribute slightly more positively than P=S.

2. **Amide groups (NC=O)**:
   - Molecules with amide groups (e.g., `NC(=O)c1cccnc1`) tend to have **negative values (~-0.8)**.
   - However, when combined with other polar groups (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1`), the value can be less negative or even positive (**0.28840686**).

3. **Thioether (S-C)**:
   - Molecules with sulfur (e.g., `Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1`) tend to have **negative values (~-0.76)** unless counterbalanced by other groups.

4. **Combination of P=O, NC=O, and S-C**:
   - The molecule in question has:
     - A **phosphate group (P=O)** (likely positive contribution).
     - An **amide (NC=O)** (likely negative contribution).
     - A **thioether (S-C)** (likely negative contribution).
   - The net effect depends on the balance of these groups. Given that P=O is strongly polar and often increases the value, while NC=O and S-C decrease it, the net value is likely **moderately positive but lower than pure P=O cases**.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (P=O, no amide, no S-C): **0.4524855**.
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (P=S, no amide, no S-C): **0.23631807**.
- `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (amide only): **-0.83622204**.
- `Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1` (S-C only): **-0.76282947**.

Given that the target molecule has **P=O (+), NC=O (-), and S-C (-)**, the net value should be **lower than 0.4524855 but still positive** due to the dominance of P=O over the other groups.

### Predicted Value:
A reasonable estimate is **~0.25**, similar to the P=S case but slightly higher due to P=O. 

However, since the amide and thioether are both present and likely reduce the value, the final prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 0.15** (moderately positive, but dampened by the amide and thioether). 

(Note: Without a direct match in the examples, this is an approximate interpolation based on the trends.)

Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.20135310869836232
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have moderate to high positive property values. For example:
     - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a value of **0.56395758**.
     - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (dichlorophenol) has a value of **0.76769957**.
   - However, `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (chloroaniline) has a negative value (**-0.29600589**), suggesting that the presence of other functional groups (like amines) can override the chlorine effect.

2. **Double Bonds (Alkenes)**:
   - Simple alkenes or molecules with double bonds often have positive property values. For example:
     - `CCCC(=C)C` (a branched alkene) has a value of **0.86195361**.
     - `CC1=CCCCC1` (a cyclohexene derivative) has a value of **0.23671445**.

3. **Symmetry and Small Size**:
   - Small, symmetric molecules with halogens (like dichloroethene) often have moderate property values. For example:
     - `CCBr` (bromoethane) has a very low value (**-0.81564338**), but this is likely due to the lack of double bonds or additional chlorines.
     - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (hexachlorobiphenyl) is large and highly chlorinated, giving it a moderate positive value.

### Prediction for Cl\C=C/Cl:
- The molecule is small, symmetric, and has two chlorine atoms attached to a double bond (alkene). 
- Based on the examples, the presence of chlorine and a double bond suggests a positive property value, likely in the range of **0.5 to 0.8**.
- It is most similar to `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (dichlorophenol, **0.76769957**) but lacks the aromatic ring and hydroxyl group, which may slightly reduce the value.
- It is also somewhat similar to `CC1=CCCCC1` (cyclohexene derivative, **0.23671445**), but the chlorines should increase the value.

### Final Prediction:
Given these observations, I predict the property value for **Cl\C=C/Cl** to be approximately **0.65**.

### Predicted value:
**0.65**
==================================================
Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.7175278852416429
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Heteroatoms**:
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2**: -0.709 (complex aromatic with N and O)
   - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23**: -0.712 (polycyclic aromatic with multiple N)
   - **COc5cc4OCC3Oc2c1CC(Oc1ccc2C(=O)C3c4cc5OC)C(C)=C**: -0.212 (complex polycyclic with O)
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2**: -0.673 (aromatic with multiple N and O)
   - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12**: -0.361 (aromatic with multiple N)

   Pyridine (**c1ccncc1**) is a simple aromatic ring with one nitrogen. Its property value is likely to be less negative than polycyclic or heavily substituted aromatic systems with heteroatoms.

2. **Simple Aromatic Systems**:
   - **CNc1ccccc1**: 0.855 (aniline derivative, aromatic with N)
   - **CCNc1ccccc1**: -0.752 (aromatic with N, but with longer alkyl chain)
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Oc1cc(C)nn1c2ccccc2**: -0.640 (aromatic with N and O)

   Pyridine is simpler than these but has a nitrogen directly in the ring, which may lower the property value compared to benzene derivatives with nitrogen substituents.

3. **Non-Aromatic or Saturated Systems**:
   - **CCCCCCCBr**: 0.512 (alkyl bromide)
   - **ClCC(C)C**: 0.363 (alkyl chloride)
   - **CC(C)(C)CCO**: 0.914 (alcohol)

   These are not directly comparable, but they show that saturated systems tend to have higher (less negative) property values than aromatic systems with heteroatoms.

4. **Other Aromatic Systems**:
   - **Cc1cc(C)c2ccccc2c1**: -0.012 (polycyclic aromatic)
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43**: -0.793 (large polycyclic aromatic)
   - **Cc1cccc2c1Cc3ccccc32**: -0.816 (polycyclic aromatic)

   Pyridine is simpler and likely less negative than these polycyclic systems.

### Prediction for Pyridine (**c1ccncc1**):
- Pyridine is a simple aromatic heterocycle with one nitrogen. Based on the examples:
  - Aromatic systems with nitrogen tend to have property values in the range of **-0.7 to 0.8**, depending on substitution and complexity.
  - Simple systems like **CNc1ccccc1** (0.855) are more positive, while more complex or polycyclic systems are more negative.
  - Pyridine is simpler than most of the nitrogen-containing examples, but the nitrogen in the ring likely reduces the property value compared to benzene.

Given this, I predict the property value for pyridine to be **around 0.3 to 0.6**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value for c1ccncc1: 0.45**

Iteration: 59
SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 0.28029720714788864
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value. Here's my reasoning:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Ether (OCC(O)CO-)**: Ethers like this are present in some examples (e.g., COC1=CC(=O)..., -0.452; CCOC(=O)..., -0.802). They tend to contribute negatively to the property, but the effect depends on the rest of the molecule.
   - **Ester (COC(=O)-)**: Esters (e.g., CCOC(=O)CC, -0.802) often correlate with negative values.
   - **Aromatic ring with substituents (c1ccccc1N-)**: Aromatic rings with polar substituents (e.g., N, Cl) can vary. For example:
     - Clc1ccc(I)cc1: -0.296 (halogenated aromatic).
     - Cc1ccccc1Cl: 0.969 (chlorinated aromatic with methyl).
   - **Heteroaromatic system (Nc2ccnc3...)**: Nitrogen-containing heteroaromatics (e.g., c1ccc2cnccc2c1: 0.058) often have modest positive values unless heavily substituted.
   - **Chlorine substituent (Cl)**: Chlorine can polarize the molecule. Examples show mixed effects:
     - Clc1ccc(I)cc1: -0.296 (negative).
     - ClCC#N: 0.696 (positive).
   - **Hydroxy groups (OCC(O)-)**: Polyols like OCC(O)CO... are present in OCC(O)C(O)... (-0.771), suggesting a negative contribution.

2. **Combined Effects**:
   - The molecule combines an ester (negative contribution), a polar hydroxy/ether chain (likely negative), and a complex aromatic system with nitrogen and chlorine (could be slightly positive or neutral). The net effect is likely a balance between these opposing contributions.

3. **Similar Examples**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC (-0.739)**: Diester with aromatic, similar to our ester + aromatic.
   - **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 (-0.739)**: Aromatic with polar amides, somewhat analogous to our N-linked aromatics.
   - **Nc2ccnc3...**: Similar to c1ccc2cnccc2c1 (0.058), but with more substitution.

### Prediction:
Given the ester (-0.8-like), polar chain (-0.7-like), and moderately positive aromatic contributions (~0.0 to 0.5), the net value is likely slightly negative but less extreme than pure aliphatic esters. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**  
*(This aligns with molecules like COC1=CC(=O)CC(C)C13Oc2c(Cl)c(OC)cc(OC)c2C3=O, which has esters, ethers, and chlorinated aromatics and a value of -0.452.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.7157240169116496
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol) by identifying patterns in the data. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**: The molecule has a hydroxyl group (-OH), which is polar and can form hydrogen bonds. In the examples, molecules with -OH groups (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O`, `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl`) tend to have negative property values, suggesting that -OH groups may correlate with lower (more negative) values. However, `OC1CCCCCCC1` (cycloheptanol) has a high positive value (0.907), indicating that context matters (e.g., ring systems vs. linear chains).

2. **Chain Length and Hydrophobicity**: Linear alkanes (e.g., `CCCc1ccccc1`, `CCCCCCCI`) tend to have negative or modestly positive values. The presence of a polar -OH group in **CCCCCO** might counteract the hydrophobicity of the alkyl chain.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `CCOC=O` (ethyl acetate) has a value of 0.220, which is modestly positive. This has an ester group, which is polar but not as strongly H-bonding as -OH.
   - `COC=O` (methyl formate) has a value of -0.828, but this is a smaller, more volatile ester.
   - `OC1CCCCCCC1` (cycloheptanol) has a high positive value (0.907), but this is a cyclic structure.
   - `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (a branched alcohol) has a value of 0.144, which is slightly positive.

4. **Prediction**: For **CCCCCO**, the linear chain with a terminal -OH group is likely to have a modestly positive property value, similar to `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` but perhaps slightly lower due to less branching. The examples suggest that alcohols can span a range, but linear alcohols may not be as extreme as cyclic or highly substituted ones.

**Predicted property value for CCCCO: ~0.15** (similar to `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` but adjusted for linearity). 

Given the variability in the data, a reasonable estimate would be **0.10 to 0.20**. If forced to pick a specific value, I'd predict **0.15**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trends in the provided data.)

Iteration: 61
SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: -0.7603279422805278
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, aromaticity, functional groups, and overall molecular complexity. The molecule in question is:

**CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**

Let's break down its structural features:
1. **Aromatic ring (c2ccccc2)**: Present in many examples, often associated with moderate property values (e.g., 0.256 for Sc2nc1ccccc1s2, 0.130 for Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2).
2. **Sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O))**: Polar and electron-withdrawing, likely reducing the property value (similar to Cl or F substitutions, which often lower the value).
3. **Amide group (C(=O)N)**: Polar but can have mixed effects depending on context (e.g., CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1 has 0.288).
4. **Heterocycle (CCO1)**: The oxygen in the ring adds polarity, but the exact effect depends on the rest of the structure.
5. **Methyl group (CC1=)**: Non-polar, tends to increase the property value slightly (e.g., Cc1cc(C)c(C)c(C)c1C has 0.950).

Comparing to similar molecules:
- **Sc2nc1ccccc1s2** (0.256): Contains aromatic rings and heteroatoms (S, N), similar to our molecule but with less polarity from the sulfonyl group.
- **Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2** (0.131): Aromatic with polar amino groups, but no sulfonyl or amide.
- **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1** (0.288): Contains amide and aromatic ring, but no sulfonyl group.

The sulfonyl group is highly polar and likely reduces the property value more than the amide or aromatic components increase it. Thus, the predicted value should be **moderate but lower than purely aromatic or amide-containing molecules**.

**Predicted property value: 0.142** (a balance between the aromatic/amide contributions and the sulfonyl group's polarity). 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples, as no explicit pattern or formula is provided. The actual value could vary slightly depending on unaccounted interactions.)

Iteration: 62
SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 0.9688525385640762
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C` by analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples.

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Aromatic system with nitro group (`N(=O)=O`)**: This is present in the phenyl ring (`c2ccccc2N(=O)=O`). From the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative property values (e.g., `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has -0.68478991, `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` has -0.84730359). This suggests a negative contribution.
2. **Ester groups (`COC(=O)` and `C(=O)OC`)**: Esters are present in some examples, but their influence varies. For instance, `CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC` has -0.60272895, while `CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC` has 0.91037367. The presence of multiple esters might balance out or slightly increase the property value.
3. **Heterocyclic nitrogen (`NC(=C...)`)**: The nitrogen in the non-aromatic ring may contribute positively, as seen in molecules like `c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2` (-0.8128651, but this is aromatic) or `CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O` (0.18582781). The exact impact depends on the environment.
4. **Substituted phenyl ring (`c2ccccc2N(=O)=O`)**: This is similar to `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` (-0.36124346) but with an additional nitro group, which likely makes the property more negative.
5. **Branched aliphatic groups (`C(C)`)**: These often contribute positively (e.g., `CCC(C)C(C)C` has 0.95842837), but the nitro group's influence may dominate here.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The closest example is `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = -0.68478991), which has a nitro-substituted phenyl ring and a small aliphatic group. Our molecule has additional ester groups and a heterocyclic nitrogen, which might slightly increase the property value compared to this example.
- Another similar example is `CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O` (property = 0.18582781), which has a heterocyclic nitrogen and aromatic systems but no nitro group. The nitro group in our molecule would likely reduce this value.

### Predicted property:
Given the strong negative contribution from the nitro group and the balancing effects of the esters and heterocyclic nitrogen, I predict the property value to be slightly less negative than `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` but still in the negative range. 

**Predicted property value: -0.45** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the examples). 

This is an educated guess, as the exact property is not explicitly defined in the examples, but the nitro group's presence is a strong indicator of a negative value.
==================================================
Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.8208304084616878
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). It is a cyclic diamide (imide) structure, which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (both as a donor and acceptor).
2. **Polarity**: The presence of multiple carbonyl groups (C=O) and N-H bonds suggests high polarity, which often correlates with lower property values in the given dataset (e.g., similar to other polar/heterocyclic compounds like **c1ccncc1** or **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12**).
3. **Aromaticity**: The molecule is not aromatic, but the rigid cyclic structure (including the cyclopropane) may influence its properties.
4. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **c1ccncc1** (pyridine, aromatic N-heterocycle): **-0.71752789**
   - **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12** (purine-like, polar N-heterocycle): **-0.78578239**
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (steroid-like, polar carbonyls): **-0.84384501**
   - **ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (polar carbonyl/amide): **-0.63112073**

   These polar/heterocyclic compounds with hydrogen-bonding capacity tend to have negative property values in the dataset.

### Prediction:
Given the high polarity, hydrogen-bonding capability, and lack of hydrophobic/aliphatic dominance, the property value is likely **negative** and moderately low, similar to other polar cyclic amides or imides. 

A reasonable estimate would be close to **-0.75**, based on the following reasoning:
- The molecule is more polar than simple heterocycles like pyridine but less complex than large polycyclic systems.
- The cyclopropane ring adds rigidity but doesn't significantly increase hydrophobicity.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: -0.75** (approximate, likely between -0.7 and -0.8).
==================================================
Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: -0.815643378952793
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCC** (chloroethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes with Halogens**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): Property = -0.46277191
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (pentachlorobenzene): Property = -0.59338196
   - **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl** (a polychlorinated hydrocarbon): Property = -0.42605481
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (iodochlorobenzene): Property = 0.9692727 (note the iodine substitution seems to drastically increase the value).

   Halogenated aromatics tend to have negative property values, except when paired with heavy halogens like iodine.

2. **Simple Alkanes**:
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): Property = 0.63896814
   - **CCC(C)(C)CC** (branched alkane): Property = -0.33669735
   - **C1CC=CC1** (cyclopentene): Property = -0.8219678

   Linear alkanes have positive values, while branched/cyclic alkanes have lower or negative values.

3. **Chlorinated Alkanes**:
   - **ClCC** is a simple chlorinated alkane (chloroethane). The only directly comparable example is **CC#N** (acetonitrile), which has a very high property value (0.96942368), but this is a nitrile, not a chloride. 

   Since chlorinated aromatics tend to have negative values and simple alkanes are positive, **ClCC** is likely somewhere in between. The chlorine substituent likely reduces the property value compared to a pure alkane like **CCCCC** (0.63896814), but not as much as in aromatic systems.

### Prediction for **ClCC**:
- Chloroethane is a small, linear chlorinated alkane. Given that:
  - **CCCCC** (pentane) = 0.63896814
  - **CCC(C)(C)CC** (branched alkane) = -0.33669735
  - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) = -0.46277191

  The property for **ClCC** is likely slightly positive but lower than **CCCCC**, as the chlorine introduces some polarity but not as much as in aromatic systems. 

### Estimated Property:
A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **0.2 to 0.4**. Given the examples, I'll predict:

**Predicted property for ClCC: 0.35** (specific value chosen based on interpolation between similar molecules). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. The actual value could vary depending on the specific property being modeled.)

Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.1701724890377891
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms (e.g., **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O**, property = 0.927) tend to have higher property values. 
   - The presence of **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a trichloromethyl group) is associated with high values (e.g., **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, property = 0.969).

2. **Aromatic Systems with Heteroatoms**:
   - Pyridine-like structures (e.g., **c2ccc1ocnc1c2**, property = -0.813) tend to lower the property value, but this effect is mitigated by heavy halogen substitution.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has:
     - A pyridine ring (**n1**) with chlorine substitution (slightly lowering effect).
     - A **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group (strongly raising effect).
   - Compare to **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (property = 0.969), which has two aromatic rings and a **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group. Here, the pyridine ring may slightly reduce the value compared to benzene, but the **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group dominates.

### Prediction:
Given the strong raising effect of **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** and the moderate lowering effect of the pyridine ring, the predicted property value for **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** is slightly lower than **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** but still high.

**Predicted property value: 0.89** (approximate, likely between 0.85 and 0.93 based on similar examples). 

For specificity, I'll predict **0.892** (close to the high-end examples like **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O** at 0.927 and **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** at 0.969). 

### Final Answer:
**0.892**
==================================================
Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.6263920579940547
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Oxygen (O) in Alcohols (-OH)**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC**: Property = -0.45726625
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1**: Property = 0.68414248
   - **CCC(C)CCO**: Property = 0.8573103
   - **CCC(CC)CO**: Property = -0.77948576
   - **CC1CC2C3CC(F)C4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**: Property = 0.49333291
   - **OCC1OC(C(O)C1O)n2cnc3c(O)ncnc23**: Property = -0.37979097

   The property values for alcohols vary widely, suggesting that the position of the -OH group and the overall structure (e.g., branching, aromaticity) play a significant role.

2. **Branching in Alcohols**:
   - **CCC(C)CCO** (branched, terminal -OH): Property = 0.8573103
   - **CCC(CC)CO** (branched, terminal -OH): Property = -0.77948576
   - **CCCCC(C)O** (branched, terminal -OH): Similar to these examples.

3. **Chain Length**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains with -OH tend to have higher variability in property values, but no clear linear trend is evident.

### Comparison with **CCCCC(C)O**:
- The molecule is a branched alcohol with a 6-carbon chain and the -OH group on a secondary carbon (similar to **CCC(C)CCO** and **CCC(CC)CO**).
- The closest structural analogs are:
  - **CCC(C)CCO**: Property = 0.8573103
  - **CCC(CC)CO**: Property = -0.77948576
  - **CCCC(O)CCC**: Property = -0.45726625

The property seems to depend heavily on the exact branching and position of the -OH group. Given that **CCCCC(C)O** is a branched alcohol like **CCC(C)CCO** and **CCC(CC)CO**, but with a slightly longer chain, we might expect its property to fall somewhere between these two values.

### Prediction:
Given the variability, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCC(C)O** would be close to the average of similar branched alcohols:
- Average of **CCC(C)CCO (0.8573103)** and **CCC(CC)CO (-0.77948576)**: ~0.04
However, this seems too low. Alternatively, considering **CCCC(O)CCC (-0.45726625)**, the property might lean slightly negative but not as extreme as **CCC(CC)CO**.

A more plausible prediction is around **-0.3 to 0.1**. Given the examples, I'll predict:

**Predicted property for CCCCC(C)O: -0.45** (closer to **CCCC(O)CCC** but accounting for branching). 

However, this is uncertain due to the variability in the data. If forced to pick a specific value, I'd say **-0.45**. 

(Note: Without a clear mathematical model or more examples, this is an educated guess based on structural similarity.)

Iteration: 67
SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.2960058925574224
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds:**
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene): Property = **0.88108595**
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl): Property = **0.88108595**
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (2,5-dichlorophenol): Property = **0.82827795**
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (2,5-dichlorophenol, same as above): Property = **0.76769957**

   These show that dihalogenated aromatic rings (especially para-substituted) tend to have **positive property values** in the range of **0.76–0.88**.

2. **Brominated vs. Chlorinated:**
   - Bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine, which may slightly increase the property value due to enhanced electronic effects.
   - Example: **CI** (iodomethane) has a property of **-0.82914606**, but this is not directly comparable due to being aliphatic and monohalogenated.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution Pattern:**
   - Para-substituted dihalobenzenes (e.g., 1,4-dichlorobenzene) have higher positive values than ortho/meta or mono-substituted variants.
   - **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is para-substituted, similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**, which has a high value (**0.88108595**).

4. **Other Halogenated Examples:**
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl** (chloroform): Property = **-0.77101451** (negative, aliphatic).
   - **ClC(=C)Cl** (1,1-dichloroethene): Property = **0.96852723** (very high, likely due to unsaturation).

### Prediction for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1:
- The molecule is structurally analogous to **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**, but with bromine instead of chlorine. 
- Bromine's larger size and polarizability may slightly increase the property compared to chlorine, but the effect is likely small since the substitution pattern is identical.
- Given that **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a property of **0.88108595**, we can expect **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** to have a similar or slightly higher value.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1: 0.89**  
(Approximated slightly higher than 1,4-dichlorobenzene due to bromine's polarizability, but still in the same range as other para-dihalogenated aromatics).

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 0.8316431914918571
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Biphenyl**: The molecule consists of two benzene rings (biphenyl) with multiple chlorine substituents (6 chlorines in total). 
   - Similar to the provided example: **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property = -0.38248578), which is a fully chlorinated biphenyl (10 chlorines). 
   - The given molecule has fewer chlorines (6 vs. 10), but the core biphenyl structure is the same.

2. **Symmetry and Substitution Pattern**: The chlorines are symmetrically distributed on both rings, which may influence the property similarly to the fully chlorinated example but with a slightly less pronounced effect due to fewer chlorines.

3. **Comparison to Other Examples**:
   - The fully chlorinated biphenyl (10 Cl) has a property of **-0.38248578**.
   - Less chlorinated or simpler halogenated aromatics (e.g., **ClC(Br)Br**) have more negative values (e.g., **-0.82224909**).
   - The given molecule is intermediate in chlorination between these two cases.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to the fully chlorinated biphenyl but with fewer chlorines, the property should be slightly more negative than **-0.38248578** but less negative than **-0.82224909**. 

A reasonable estimate would be around **-0.45 to -0.50**. 

For specificity, let's predict:  
**-0.47**

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl** is **-0.47**.

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: -0.39878958586463065
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphate Group (P=O)**: The molecule contains a phosphate group (OP(=O)(...)), which is polar and can influence hydrophilicity or electronic properties. In the examples, molecules with phosphate groups (e.g., CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC) have property values ranging from **-0.59175658** to **0.90231581**, depending on the rest of the structure.
2. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule has multiple aromatic rings (e.g., c1ccc... and c2cccc...), which are common in the examples. Aromaticity alone does not strongly correlate with a specific property value, but substitutions matter:
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl groups, -O-) tend to increase the property value (e.g., **CC(C)c1ccccc1** has **0.68414248**).
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens, -NO2) tend to decrease it (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1Cl** has **0.9692727**, but this is an outlier due to symmetry).
3. **Methyl Substitutions**: The molecule has methyl groups (-CH3) on the aromatic rings, which are electron-donating and often correlate with higher property values (e.g., **CC(C)c1ccccc1** has **0.68414248**).
4. **Ether Linkages (-O-)**: The molecule contains ether linkages (Oc2cccc...), which are polar but not strongly electron-withdrawing. Examples with ethers (e.g., **COc1ccc(cc1)C(...)**) have values like **0.43196654**.
5. **Overall Polarity**: The phosphate group and aromatic ethers suggest moderate polarity, but the methyl groups add hydrophobicity.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC**: Phosphate-like group, property = **0.90231581** (but this is a sulfur analog and may not be directly comparable).
- **COc1ccc(cc1)C(...)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: Aromatic ethers + polar groups, property = **0.43196654**.
- **CC(C)c1ccccc1**: Methylated aromatic, property = **0.68414248**.

### Prediction:
Given the mix of polar phosphate/ether groups and hydrophobic methyl/aromatic components, the property value is likely in the **moderately positive range**. The closest analogs suggest a value between **0.4 and 0.6**.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**0.52** (a balanced estimate considering the structural features and trends in the examples).

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -0.8541986087217718
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: Present in the molecule. From the examples, molecules with CF3 (e.g., `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl`) tend to have higher positive values (0.93284264), but this is not a strict rule.
2. **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The molecule has a benzene ring with a CF3 group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. Aromaticity often contributes to higher values (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1C` has 0.9692727), but substituents can modulate this.
3. **Chlorine atoms (Cl)**: Multiple Cl atoms are present. In the examples, Cl-rich molecules like `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl` have high values (0.95278873), but others like `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` have lower values (0.08917708), suggesting Cl alone is not deterministic.
4. **Ketone (C=O) and nitrogen heterocycle**: The presence of a ketone and a nitrogen-containing ring (pyrrolidinone-like) may lower the value, as seen in `Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12` (-0.78578239) or `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C` (-0.16588696).
5. **Polar functional groups**: The combination of CF3, Cl, and C=O introduces polarity, which may reduce the value compared to purely aromatic systems.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` (0.93284264): Contains SO2, Cl, and N, but no CF3. High value due to sulfonamide and Cl.
- `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` (0.08917708): Multiple Cl atoms but lower value due to lack of aromaticity boosting.
- `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C` (-0.16588696): Contains CF3 and polar groups, leading to a negative value.

### Prediction:
The molecule has both CF3 (tending to increase value) and polar/heterocyclic features (tending to decrease value). The presence of Cl and aromaticity may partially offset the polar effects. Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is a **moderately positive value**, but lower than highly aromatic or Cl-rich molecules.

**Predicted property value: 0.25**  
*(This is an educated guess based on balancing the contributions of CF3, Cl, and polar groups. The actual value could vary but likely falls between 0.1 and 0.4 based on the training examples.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 71
SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.9336823161466126
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Methoxy group (-OCH3)**: Present in molecules like `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (property = 0.91758103) and `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C` (property = 0.96885254). These molecules have high positive property values.
   - **Nitro group (-NO2)**: Present in molecules like `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = -0.65605192) and `c2ccccc2N(=O)=O` (implicit in some examples). Nitro groups can lower the property when combined with certain other groups.

2. **Aromatic Ring**:
   - The molecule has a benzene ring substituted with methoxy and nitro groups. Similar structures include:
     - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol, property = -0.46277191).
     - `Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2` (property = 0.88038304), where an oxygen is attached to an aromatic system but with a fused heterocycle.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The methoxy group is electron-donating, which tends to increase the property (as seen in high values for methoxy-containing molecules).
   - The nitro group is electron-withdrawing, which tends to decrease the property (as seen in `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` with a negative value).
   - The net effect depends on the balance between these groups. Here, the methoxy group is likely dominant because it is directly attached to the aromatic ring, while the nitro group is at the para position (less direct effect).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (property = 0.91758103): Two ester groups (electron-withdrawing) but still high property due to methoxy-like contributions.
- `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = -0.65605192): Two nitro groups, strongly electron-withdrawing, leading to a negative value.
- `Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2` (property = 0.88038304): Oxygen attached to aromatic + fused heterocycle, high property.

### Prediction:
Given the methoxy group's strong positive contribution and the nitro group's partial offsetting effect, the property is likely **positive but lower than methoxy-dominated examples**. A reasonable estimate is between **0.2 and 0.5**.

Looking at the exact structural match (methoxy + nitro on benzene), the closest analog is `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (-0.656), but with one nitro replaced by methoxy, the property should increase significantly. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 0.35** (specific estimate based on balancing the groups' effects). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend that electron-donating groups increase the property and electron-withdrawing groups decrease it.)

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: -0.5380308867785148
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

**ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**

### Structural Analysis:
1. **High Chlorine Substitution**: The molecule is heavily chlorinated, with multiple chlorine atoms attached to a polycyclic structure. This is reminiscent of molecules like:
   - `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (property = 0.652936)
   - `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (property = 0.94957184)
   Highly chlorinated molecules in the examples tend to have positive property values, often in the range of 0.6 to 0.95.

2. **Polycyclic Framework**: The molecule has a complex polycyclic structure with multiple fused rings. Similar polycyclic examples include:
   - `CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2` (property = 0.12630494)
   - `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (property = 0.88038304)
   Polycyclic structures with electronegative substituents (like halogens) often have higher property values.

3. **Electronegativity and Polarity**: The high electronegativity of chlorine atoms and the polar nature of the bonds will contribute to the property value. This is consistent with other highly halogenated molecules in the dataset.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The closest analog is `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (property = 0.652936), but the given molecule is even more chlorinated and has a more complex polycyclic structure. 
- Another similar example is `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (property = 0.94957184), which is highly chlorinated and aromatic, but the given molecule is aliphatic and more sterically crowded.

### Prediction:
Given the extreme degree of chlorination and the polycyclic nature of the molecule, the property value is likely to be on the higher end of the observed range. The additional steric complexity compared to `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` suggests a higher value, but not as high as the aromatic `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`. 

**Predicted property value: 0.85**

This is a reasonable estimate based on the structural similarities and trends in the provided data.

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.939616183311892
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NH₂, -NO₂, -C=O) often have higher (positive) property values, especially if they can participate in hydrogen bonding or strong dipole interactions.
   - Nonpolar or weakly polar molecules (e.g., hydrocarbons, halogens without polar groups) tend to have lower (negative) property values.

2. **Presence of Carbonyl (C=O)**:
   - Esters (e.g., **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, property = 0.563) and amides (e.g., **NC(=O)c1ccccc1**, property = -0.836) show variability, but esters with additional polar groups tend to have positive values.
   - Simple aldehydes/ketones (e.g., **CC(=O)CCC1C(=O)N...**, property = -0.722) can have negative values unless paired with other polar features.

3. **Ether Linkage (-O-)**:
   - Ethers (e.g., **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, property = 0.922) often have positive values, especially if aromatic or combined with other polar groups.

4. **Chain Length and Saturation**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCCC=C**, property = -0.266) tend to reduce the property value unless offset by polar groups.

### Analysis of **CCCOC=O**:
- The molecule is **propyl formate**, an ester with the structure:  
  **CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-O-CH=O**.
- It contains:
  - A polar ester group (**-OC=O**), which is electron-withdrawing and can participate in dipole interactions.
  - A short aliphatic chain (**propyl group**), which is weakly polar but not strongly hydrophobic.
- Compared to similar examples:
  - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (property = 0.563) has an ester + aromatic amine, giving a positive value.
  - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2** (property = 0.163) has a more complex polar structure but still positive.
  - Simple esters without additional polar groups (e.g., **methyl formate** analogs) are not in the examples, but the ester group alone seems to contribute positively.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of the ester group (polar) and the short alkyl chain (minimal nonpolar contribution), the property value is likely **moderately positive**. 

Looking at similar-sized polar molecules:
- **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (property = 0.684) has a polar -OH and aromatic ring.
- **CC#N** (property = 0.969) is highly polar.

For **CCCOC=O**, the ester is less polar than a nitrile but more polar than a simple alcohol. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.55** (range: 0.5 to 0.6). 

This aligns with the trend where esters with small alkyl groups have positive but not extreme values.
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.5529910838181228
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Chain Length**: 
   - Molecules with long aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCCCc1ccccc1` with property **0.93986196**) tend to have higher (more positive) property values. 
   - Shorter chains (e.g., `CC` with property **-0.82914606**) have lower (more negative) values.

2. **Polar/Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl `-OH`, carbonyl `C=O`, halogens) tend to have lower property values (more negative). 
   - For example, `OCC(O)C(O)CO` has a value of **-0.84235739**, and `CCI` has **-0.81564338**.

3. **Aromaticity**:
   - Pure aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1` with **0.88038304**) tend to have high positive values.
   - Aromatics with polar substituents (e.g., `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` with **-0.29600589**) reduce the property value.

4. **Esters and Carbonyls**:
   - Esters (e.g., `COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C` with **-0.85482089**) often have negative values, but the effect depends on the rest of the structure.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**
- **Structure**: This is a long aliphatic chain (`CCCCCCCCC`) with an ester group (`C(=O)OCC`).
- **Chain Length**: The long hydrocarbon chain (10 carbons) suggests a contribution toward a higher (positive) property value, similar to `CCCCCCc1ccccc1` (0.939) or `CCC1CCCCC1` (0.908).
- **Ester Group**: The presence of the polar ester group (`C(=O)OCC`) will reduce the property value, but the long hydrophobic chain may dominate.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
1. `CCCCCCc1ccccc1` (7-carbon chain + benzene): **0.93986196**  
   → Long chain + aromatic → high value.
2. `CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (steroid with carbonyl and hydroxyl): **-0.8254996**  
   → Polar groups reduce value despite size.
3. `CCCC=C(CC)C=O` (unsaturated aldehyde): **-0.76441072**  
   → Polar carbonyl reduces value despite chain length.
4. `CCCOC` (ether): **0.63896814**  
   → Less polar than ester, shorter chain, but still positive.

### Prediction:
The long hydrocarbon chain (`CCCCCCCCC`) will push the value toward the positive range, but the ester group (`C(=O)OCC`) will moderate this. Given that `CCCCCCc1ccccc1` (7-carbon + aromatic) is **0.939**, and `CCCOC` (ether) is **0.638**, this molecule (10-carbon + ester) likely falls between these, but closer to the higher end due to the long chain.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 0.75**  
(Reasoning: Dominance of the long hydrophobic chain offsets the polar ester, but not as high as pure hydrocarbons/aromatics.)

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol-like core (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)**: 
   - Similar to **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 0.17027227), but with additional substitutions.
   - Phenol derivatives in the examples tend to have positive or near-zero values unless heavily substituted with electron-withdrawing groups.

2. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: 
   - Present in molecules like **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property = -0.70932493), which has a negative value due to the amide and aromatic substitutions.

3. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - Seen in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = 0.3391393), which has a positive value, suggesting nitro groups can increase the property unless counterbalanced by other features.

4. **Chlorine substitutions (Cl)**:
   - Chlorine is present in many examples, with varying effects. In **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1**, it slightly increases the property (0.17027227), but in **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, the property is highly negative (-0.85398404) due to multiple chlorines and ether linkages.

5. **Overall polarity and conjugation**:
   - The molecule is highly conjugated and polar due to the phenol, amide, nitro, and chlorine groups. Such features in the examples often lead to negative property values (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** = -0.70932493).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog is **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property = -0.70932493), which shares the amide linkage and chloro-phenol. The addition of a nitro group here may slightly increase the property (as nitro alone can contribute positively, e.g., +0.3391393 in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**), but the overall effect is likely still negative due to the amide and multiple chlorines.

### Prediction:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing effects of the amide and nitro groups, combined with the chloro substitutions, the property value is expected to be **negative but less negative than -0.70932493** (due to the nitro group's partial counterbalance). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.45** (specific value between -0.70932493 and -0.2, accounting for the nitro group's influence). 

However, reviewing the examples more carefully, **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** (with multiple chlorines and ether) has a very negative value (-0.85398404), while **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitro + chlorine) is positive (+0.3391393). The amide linkage in our molecule likely dominates, pulling the value negative. 

Thus, a refined prediction is closer to **-0.6** (balancing the nitro's slight positive effect against the amide and chlorines). 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: -0.55** (specific estimate interpolated from similar examples).

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: -0.7024473405929175
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Groups (P(=S)(OC)OC)**: 
   - The molecule contains two phosphorothioate (P=S) groups, which are polar and electronegative. 
   - In the examples, similar groups (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**) have a positive property value (**0.75731512**), suggesting that P=S groups may contribute positively to the property.

2. **Aromatic Rings and Thioether Linkage (Sc1ccc...cc1)**:
   - The molecule has two aromatic rings connected by a thioether (S) linkage. 
   - Aromatic systems with halogens (e.g., **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl**) tend to have positive values (**0.8904452**), but thioethers (e.g., **CCSSCC**) have negative values (**-0.71572402**). The net effect may depend on the balance.

3. **Oxygen Substituents (Oc1ccc...)**: 
   - Oxygen atoms attached to aromatic rings (e.g., **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**) can lead to positive values (**0.94957184**), but this depends on other substituents.

4. **Symmetry and Size**:
   - The molecule is large and symmetric, with two identical phosphorothioate-aryl-thioether units. Large, symmetric molecules with polar groups in the examples (e.g., **ClC1(C(=O)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C14Cl)C5(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C45Cl**) have moderately positive values (**0.44242807**).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (value: **0.75731512**), which also has a phosphorothioate group and aromatic systems. However, the thioether linkage in the target molecule may reduce the property slightly compared to the direct SCC linkage in the example.
- The symmetry and additional phosphorothioate group could offset this reduction, leading to a similar or slightly higher value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of polar (P=S, O-aromatic) and nonpolar (aryl-thioether) features, the predicted property value is likely **positive and moderate**, similar to the phosphorothioate-containing examples. 

**Final Prediction: 0.72**  
*(This is an estimate based on the structural trends observed in the examples.)*

Iteration: 77
SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.3391393024789398
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The molecule in question is:

**Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (4-nitrophenol)

Let's analyze its features and compare them to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. **Presence of a nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: 
   - Molecules with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring tend to have higher property values. For example:
     - `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (nitrotoluene) has a value of **0.92263595**.
     - `Clc1cccc(Br)c1` (halogenated aromatic) has a value of **0.46361151**, but the nitro group seems to increase the value significantly compared to halogens.

2. **Presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) attached to an aromatic ring**:
   - `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` (a hydroxy-substituted aromatic) has a value of **0.92263595**, which is very high. This suggests that OH on an aromatic ring contributes to higher property values, especially when combined with other polar groups.

3. **Combination of OH and NO2 on the same aromatic ring**:
   - This is a strongly polar and electron-withdrawing combination, similar to the nitro-substituted and hydroxy-substituted examples above. The property value is likely to be high, close to the nitro- and hydroxy-substituted examples.

4. **Aromatic ring substitution pattern**:
   - The molecule is para-substituted (OH and NO2 on opposite sides of the ring), which is a common arrangement for polar aromatic molecules. This doesn't seem to reduce the property value compared to other substitution patterns in the dataset.

### Prediction:
Given the high values for nitro-substituted aromatics (`Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` = 0.92263595) and hydroxy-substituted aromatics (`NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` = 0.92263595), and the fact that the combination of OH and NO2 is even more polar, the predicted property value for `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` is likely **similar or slightly higher**.

However, since the exact combination isn't in the dataset, the closest analog is nitrotoluene (`Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`), which has a value of **0.92263595**. Given that OH is more polar than a methyl group, the value might be slightly higher, but the dataset doesn't show values exceeding ~0.92 for similar molecules.

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**0.92263595** (same as the closest analogs in the dataset).

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.5888589724879264
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, molecular size, and halogenation. The molecule in question is a complex carbohydrate (a sugar derivative) with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and ether linkages (O-). 

From the examples:
- Molecules with many polar groups (e.g., hydroxyls, carbonyls) tend to have negative property values (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has a value of `0.70700697`, but simpler sugars or polyols may trend negative due to high polarity).
- Highly halogenated or aromatic systems often have positive values (e.g., `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` has `0.81387257`).
- The molecule `OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O` is a highly polar, polyhydroxylated sugar with no aromatic or halogenated components, similar to `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` but larger and more branched.

Given its extensive hydroxylation and lack of hydrophobic/aromatic features, the predicted property value would likely be **positive but modest**, similar to other polar but non-halogenated molecules in the set. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: `0.654321`**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend that polar, non-aromatic molecules in the examples tend to have mid-range positive values.)

Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.696267955805313
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne) and compare it to the examples:

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Aliphatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO` with a value of 0.885) tend to have higher positive values, especially if they are long or have polar groups (like -OH).
2. **Small polar or unsaturated molecules** (e.g., `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` with -0.811) tend to have negative values.
3. **Alkynes** are present in some examples (e.g., `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N`), and their property values are influenced by other functional groups or conjugation.

### Analysis of **CCC#C**:
- It is a small alkyne (4 carbons, terminal triple bond).
- No aromaticity or polar functional groups (like -OH, -Cl, -NO2, etc.).
- Similar to small unsaturated/aliphatic molecules like `CCCC(=O)C` (0.861) or `CC#N`-containing molecules (but without additional polar groups).

Given its small size and lack of polar/aromatic features, it likely has a **moderate positive value**, similar to other small hydrocarbons or alkynes without strong polar influences. 

### Predicted property value for **CCC#C**:
**0.35** (approximate, based on trends in the data for small unsaturated/aliphatic molecules). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The value could vary if the property depends on other specific features not evident from the examples.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: -0.5063937472644454
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P=S)**: This is a polar and moderately electron-withdrawing group. In the examples, molecules with P=S (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1`) tend to have positive property values (e.g., 0.75731512). This suggests that P=S may contribute positively to the property.
2. **Aryl chloride (chlorinated benzene ring)**: The presence of multiple Cl substituents on the benzene ring (`c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) is common in the dataset. Chlorinated aromatics can have varying effects:
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a value of 0.56395758 (positive).
   - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl` has a value of -0.42340584 (negative).
   The effect seems to depend on the substitution pattern and other functional groups.
3. **Ethoxy groups (CCO-)**: These are moderately electron-donating and hydrophobic. In the examples, ethoxy groups often appear in molecules with mid-range or positive values (e.g., `CCCCOCCCC` has -0.53995296, but this is an ether with no other strong features).

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- The closest analog in the dataset is:
  `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` with a value of **0.75731512**.
  This molecule also has a P=S group and a chlorinated benzene ring, but with additional polar amide/carbamate features. Our target molecule lacks the amide but retains P=S and Cl, suggesting a slightly lower but still positive value.
- Another somewhat similar molecule is:
  `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` with a value of **0.4172683**.
  This has a chlorinated benzene with an ether linker to another aromatic ring (nitro-substituted), which is less similar but still suggests a positive value.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of P=S (strong positive contribution) and chlorinated benzene (variable but often positive when combined with P=S), the property value is likely in the **positive mid-range**. The lack of strongly negative features (e.g., long aliphatic chains or highly strained rings) supports this.

### Estimated value:
**Predicted property value: 0.45**  
*(Rationale: Slightly lower than the 0.757 of the closest analog due to fewer polar groups, but still positive due to P=S and Cl.)*

Iteration: 81
SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 0.6266699834752334
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Electron-Withdrawing Groups (EWG)**:
   - Molecules like **Nc1ccccc1Cl** (0.969), **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (0.969), and **Fc1ccccc1Br** (0.969) have high property values (~0.97) when they contain aromatic rings with strong EWGs (e.g., Cl, Br, F, NO₂). These groups increase polarity and likely contribute to higher property values.
   - Conversely, aromatic rings without EWGs or with electron-donating groups (EDGs) tend to have lower values (e.g., **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12**, -0.539).

2. **Amides and Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with amides (**C(=O)N**) or other polar groups (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1**, 0.874) often have high property values due to hydrogen bonding and polarity.
   - The presence of **C(=O)NN** (a hydrazide group) in the target molecule is highly polar and likely to increase the property value.

3. **Heterocycles**:
   - Pyridine-like heterocycles (e.g., **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23**, -0.712) often have negative values unless paired with EWGs or polar groups.
   - The target molecule has a pyridine ring (**c1nccc...c1**), but the **C(=O)NN** substituent is strongly polar, which may counteract the heterocycle's effect.

4. **Non-Aromatic/Aliphatic Systems**:
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., **C=C**, -0.784; **CC(C)C**, -0.822) have very low values unless functionalized with polar groups.

### Target Molecule: **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**
- **Structure**: Pyridine ring with a **C(=O)NN** (hydrazide) substituent.
- **Key Features**:
  - The hydrazide group is highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (similar to amides, which increase property values).
  - The pyridine ring is a weak EWG, but the hydrazide dominates the polarity.
- **Analogous Examples**:
  - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (0.874): Amide + aromatic ring with EWGs.
  - **N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (0.921): Diphenylamine (no EWGs but aromatic + N).
  - The hydrazide is even more polar than a simple amide, so the value should be high but likely slightly lower than the diphenylamine due to the heterocycle.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong polarity of the hydrazide group and the pyridine ring, the value should be **~0.85**. 

#### Final Prediction: **0.85** (likely between 0.84 and 0.87 based on similar examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend that polar/EWG features correlate with higher values in the given data.)

Predicted Property:
Given the diverse set of molecules and their associated property values, I'll analyze the structural features and trends to predict the property for the new molecule: **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**.

### Key Observations from the Training Data:
1. **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., P=O or P=S)**:
   - Example: `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1` has a property value of **-0.79675639**.
   - The presence of `P(=S)` seems to correlate with negative property values (around -0.7 to -0.8).

2. **Thioester or sulfur-containing groups (e.g., -S- or -C(=O)S-)**:
   - Example: `CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1` has a value of **-0.77425738**.
   - Sulfur in non-aromatic contexts tends to lower the property value.

3. **Amide groups (e.g., -C(=O)N-)**:
   - Example: `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` has a value of **-0.79379175**.
   - Amides (especially tertiary) correlate with negative values (~ -0.7 to -0.8).

4. **Aliphatic chains (e.g., -CCCC-)**:
   - Neutral or slightly negative contributions unless combined with polar groups.

5. **Cyclic structures (e.g., cyclohexane or piperidine)**:
   - Example: `C/C1CCCCC1\C` has a value of **-0.70861747**.
   - Saturated rings tend to have moderately negative values.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C** has:
- A **P(=S)** group (similar to the example with -0.796).
- A **thioether linkage (-S-)** and an **amide (-C(=O)N-)** (similar to examples with values ~ -0.77 to -0.79).
- A **piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)** (similar to saturated rings with negative values).
- No strongly positive-contributing groups (e.g., nitro or aromatic systems with high values).

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong presence of `P(=S)`, `-S-`, and `-C(=O)N-`, combined with the aliphatic/cyclic structure, the property value is likely in the range of **-0.75 to -0.80**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.78** (close to the observed values for similar functional groups). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.78**
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.5123663462813367
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here are some key observations:

1. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, aromatics)**:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., `CCCCCCCO`, `CCCCCC1CCCC1`) tend to have property values in the range of **-0.5 to 0.5**, with longer chains or branching sometimes reducing the value (e.g., `CCCC/C=C/C` has -0.487, `CCCCCC1CCCC1` has -0.194).
   - Aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., `c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2`) tend to have more negative values when polar groups are absent.

2. **Functional groups**:
   - Polar groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -NO2) can significantly influence the property, often increasing it if electron-withdrawing (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` has 0.330) or decreasing it if hydrogen-bonding is dominant (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)CO` has -0.842).
   - Halogens (Cl, Br) often increase the property when present in aromatic systems.

3. **Chain length and branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCCCCO`) tend to have moderately positive values (0.512), while branched alkanes (e.g., `CC(C)CCO`) have more negative values (-0.827).

### Prediction for `CCCCCCCC` (octane):
- This is a simple, linear alkane with no functional groups or branching. 
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - `CCCCCCCO` (heptanol) has a value of **0.512**, but the -OH group increases the value.
  - `CCCCCC1CCCC1` (cyclohexylbutane) has a value of **-0.194**.
  - `CCCC/C=C/C` (unsaturated hydrocarbon) has a value of **-0.487**.
- Since `CCCCCCCC` is nonpolar and lacks functional groups, its value should be slightly negative but not as low as branched or unsaturated hydrocarbons. 

### Predicted property value for `CCCCCCCC`: **-0.25** (estimated based on trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The value likely represents a physicochemical property like logP, solubility, or a similar descriptor where nonpolarity reduces the value.)

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: -0.41694199935658105
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a multi-ring structure resembling steroids (e.g., **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O**, which has a property value of **-0.6059445**).
2. **Ketone group (=O)**: Present in one of the rings (similar to other steroid-like molecules with ketones, which tend to have negative values).
3. **Hydroxyl group (OH)**: Two hydroxyl groups are present (one at position 12 and one at position 4). Hydroxyl groups can influence the property, often making it more negative (e.g., **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** has **-0.84962393**).
4. **Alkyne group (C#C)**: A terminal alkyne is present, which is relatively rare in the examples. Alkynes are hydrophobic but may not drastically change the property compared to other functional groups.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** (property: **-0.6059445**): This is very similar but lacks the second hydroxyl and alkyne. The additional hydroxyl here would likely make the property more negative.
- **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** (property: **-0.48636077**): This has two ketones and one hydroxyl, and its value is less negative than the first example. Our molecule has two hydroxyls and one ketone, so it might be more negative than this.
- **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** (property: **0.87701374**): This has multiple polar groups (OH, F, C=O) but still ends up with a positive value, likely due to the extended conjugation and fluorine. Our molecule lacks fluorine and has fewer polar groups, so it should be more negative.

### Prediction:
Given the steroid-like core, two hydroxyl groups, and one ketone, the property is likely **negative** and moderately so, similar to the first example but slightly more negative due to the extra hydroxyl. The alkyne may slightly offset this, but not significantly.

**Predicted property value: -0.65**  
*(This is an estimate based on the trend observed in the examples, particularly the steroid-like molecules with hydroxyl/ketone groups.)*

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -0.8550951013066205
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, aromaticity, functional groups, and overall molecular complexity. The property appears to be influenced by:

1. **Aromatic systems**: Highly aromatic molecules (e.g., polycyclic aromatics) tend to have negative values (e.g., `c1ccccc1` = -0.717, `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45` = -0.560).
2. **Electron-withdrawing/donating groups**: Molecules with halogens (Cl, F, Br), nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`), or sulfonamides (`NS(=O)(=O)`) often have positive values (e.g., `Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` = 0.828, `NS(=O)(=O)c1cc(ccc1Cl)C2(O)NC(=O)c3ccccc23` = 0.013).
3. **Oxygen/nitrogen-containing polar groups**: Alcohols, ethers, esters, amides, and carbonyls generally increase the property value (e.g., `CCCCOCCO` = 0.512, `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1` = 0.910).
4. **Hybrid systems**: Molecules with mixed aromatic/aliphatic or polar/nonpolar features show intermediate values.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is complex, with the following key features:
- **Multiple aromatic rings** (likely contributing negatively).
- **Ether linkages (`OC`) and hydroxyl groups (`O`)**: Polar, likely increasing the value.
- **Lactone or cyclic ester (`COC2=O`)**: Polar, likely increasing the value.
- **Furan or pyran rings (`OCO`, `OC3COC`)**: Mildly polar, may have a small positive effect.
- **Overall high oxygen content**: Strong polarity, suggesting a higher positive value.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `Oc1ccccc1Cl` (phenol + chloro) = 0.969  
- `COc1ccccc1Cl` (methoxy + chloro) = -0.652 (note the inconsistency; this might be an outlier or context-dependent).  
- `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1` (highly polar cyclic amide) = 0.910  
- `CCCCOCCO` (aliphatic ether/alcohol) = 0.512  

Given the high polarity and oxygen content of the target molecule, but also its aromaticity, the value is likely **positive and moderately high**, similar to other polar aromatic systems like `Oc1ccccc1Cl` (0.969) or `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1` (0.910). However, the aromaticity might slightly reduce it.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.72**  
(Rationale: Closer to highly polar cyclic systems but slightly tempered by aromaticity.)

True Property: 0.969272697949176
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol): **0.3391393**
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (another nitrophenol, possibly a different isomer): **0.92263595**
     - The presence of an electron-withdrawing nitro group (-NO2) seems to increase the property value, especially when ortho to the hydroxyl group (higher value).
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: **0.3391393** (likely meta-nitrophenol, lower value than ortho).

2. **Chlorinated Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene): **0.9692727**
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): **0.88950313**
     - Multiple chlorines increase the property value.
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl): **-0.6980404**
     - Biphenyl with chlorines has a lower value.
   - **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (chloronaphthalene): **-0.36124346**

3. **Phenol vs. Chlorophenol**:
   - Phenol itself is not in the examples, but chlorophenol (**Oc1ccccc1Cl**) is expected to have a value between nitrophenol and non-substituted phenol.
   - The chloro group (-Cl) is electron-withdrawing but less so than nitro (-NO2), so the value should be lower than nitrophenol but higher than plain phenol (if it were listed).

4. **Other Halogenated Phenols**:
   - **Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I** (diiodo-cyanophenol): **-0.51345626**
     - Heavy halogens (I) and cyano (-CN) reduce the property value significantly.
   - **Fc1ccccc1** (fluorobenzene): **-0.46277191**
     - Fluorine reduces the value.

### Prediction for **Oc1ccccc1Cl**:
- The molecule is a monochlorophenol (likely para- or meta-, as ortho might show different effects due to sterics).
- Comparing to nitrophenol (higher value) and fluorobenzene (lower value), chlorophenol should have a moderate positive value.
- The presence of -OH (electron-donating) and -Cl (electron-withdrawing) suggests a balance, but -Cl dominates slightly.
- From the examples, similar structures (single substituent on phenol) suggest values in the range of **0.3 to 0.9**.

Given that:
- Nitrophenol (ortho): **0.92263595**
- Nitrophenol (meta): **0.3391393**
- Chloroiodobenzene: **0.9692727** (but this is not phenol)
- Dichlorobiphenyl: **-0.6980404** (not directly comparable)

A reasonable estimate for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is around **0.5**, balancing the electron-withdrawing -Cl and electron-donating -OH.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**0.55** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data.)

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 0.12725299539553422
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Cl-substituted aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)**: Similar to molecules like `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)...` (property: 0.889) or `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (property: 0.880). These tend to have positive property values when heavily halogenated.
   - **Amide linkage (OC(=O)N)**: Seen in molecules like `CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1` (property: -0.852) or `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (property: -0.854). Amides often correlate with negative values.
   - **Alkyne (C#C)**: Rare in the examples, but alkynes are relatively nonpolar and may not dominate the property.
   - **Chlorinated alkyl chain (ClCC)**: Similar to `CCCCl` (property: -0.852), suggesting a negative contribution.

2. **Polarity and Halogenation**:
   - The molecule has both polar (amide, Cl) and nonpolar (aromatic, alkyne) regions. Heavy halogenation (two Cl atoms) might push the property toward positive values, but the amide and aliphatic Cl could counteract this.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (property: -0.854): Contains halogenated aromatic + amide + aliphatic Cl, similar to our molecule. Its value is strongly negative.
   - `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (property: 0.880): Halogenated aromatic without polar groups, giving a positive value.
   - The presence of both halogenation and amide here suggests a balance, likely leaning slightly negative due to the amide's influence.

### Prediction:
Given the competing effects of the halogenated aromatic (positive contribution) and the amide + aliphatic Cl (negative contribution), the property is likely **moderately negative**, similar to other amide-containing halogenated aromatics. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.48**  

This aligns with molecules like `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (-0.150) or `Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2cc(Cl)c(F)c(Cl)c2F` (0.666), but adjusted for the less polar alkyne and stronger amide influence.

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: -0.6626611402862775
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a central oxygen (O) connected to three aromatic rings:
   - A chlorophenyl ring: **c1ccc(Cl)cc1**
   - A pyrimidine-like ring (electron-deficient): **c2cncnc2**
   - Another chlorophenyl ring: **c3ccccc3Cl**

2. **Substituents**:
   - Two chlorine atoms (electron-withdrawing) on the phenyl rings.
   - A pyrimidine-like ring (polar, electron-deficient due to nitrogen atoms).

3. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - The oxygen (O) is likely an alcohol or ether, contributing some polarity.
   - Chlorines and the pyrimidine ring are electron-withdrawing, reducing electron density.
   - The overall structure is polar but balanced by aromaticity and substituents.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Chlorinated Aromatics**: 
  - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1** has a property of **0.46361151**.
  - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has **0.96938718** (more chlorines = higher value).
- **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycles**:
  - **Nc1nc[nH]n1** has **-0.00728767** (simple heterocycle).
  - **Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2** has **0.88038304** (fused nitrogen heterocycles).
- **Oxygen-Containing Groups**:
  - **Oc1ccc(O)cc1** has **-0.29600589** (polar but symmetric).
  - **COc1cccc(Cl)c1** has **-0.67252602** (chlorine + methoxy).

### Prediction:
The given molecule combines:
- Two chlorinated phenyl rings (similar to **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, but with fewer chlorines).
- A pyrimidine-like ring (similar to **Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2** but less conjugated).
- An oxygen linker (less polar than a nitro or carbonyl group).

Given these features, the property value is likely **positive but not extremely high**, as the electron-withdrawing effects of the chlorines and pyrimidine are partially offset by the oxygen and aromaticity. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted Property Value: 0.45**  

This aligns with the trend where chlorinated aromatics with moderate polarity fall in the 0.4–0.6 range.

Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 0.03570353936092984
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Esters**: 
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate) has a property value of **0.08844264**. This is a simple ester with a 4-carbon chain and an ethoxy group.
   - **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate) is also an ester, but with a formate group (HCOO-) and a butyl chain. The formate group is smaller than the butyrate group in the example, which may slightly affect the property.

2. **Carbonyl-Containing Compounds**:
   - **CCCCCC=O** (heptanal) has a value of **0.03570354**. This is an aldehyde with a 7-carbon chain.
   - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)C** (2-nonanone) has a value of **0.66464188**. This is a ketone with a 9-carbon chain.
   - The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) seems to contribute positively to the property, but the exact value depends on the context (aldehyde vs. ketone vs. ester).

3. **Ester vs. Aldehyde/Ketone**:
   - Esters tend to have intermediate values (e.g., ethyl butyrate at **0.08844264**), while aldehydes/ketones vary more. The formate group in butyl formate is smaller and more polar, which might lower the value slightly compared to ethyl butyrate.

4. **Chain Length**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains tend to increase the property value if the functional group is the same (e.g., compare **CCCCBr** at **0.63896814** with smaller halides). However, the formate group's polarity may counteract this.

### Prediction for CCCCOC=O:
Butyl formate is structurally similar to ethyl butyrate (CCCC(=O)OCC), but with a shorter ester group (formate instead of butyrate). The formate group is more polar and may reduce the property value slightly compared to ethyl butyrate. However, the butyl chain is longer than the ethyl chain in ethyl butyrate, which could offset this. 

Given these competing effects, I estimate the property value for **CCCCOC=O** to be slightly lower than ethyl butyrate but still in a similar range. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for CCCCOC=O: ~0.06** (likely between 0.04 and 0.08, closer to the aliphatic ester examples). 

For specificity, I will predict:  
**0.065**. 

This is based on interpolation between the given ester and aldehyde examples, accounting for the formate group's polarity and the butyl chain's length.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.815643378952793
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property value for **ClCCl** (dichloromethane):

1. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of **-0.85201745**.
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane) has a property value of **-0.81564338**.
   - **CNN** (methylhydrazine) has a property value of **-0.81564338**.
   - **CCCC** (butane) has a property value of **-0.85201745**.

   These small, simple halogenated or aliphatic molecules tend to have property values clustered around **-0.8 to -0.85**.

2. **Effect of Halogens**:
   - Chlorine substituents generally lower the property value (e.g., **ClCCCl** at **-0.85201745** vs. **CCCC** at **-0.85201745**). 
   - The presence of two chlorines in **ClCCl** suggests a similar or slightly more negative value than **ClCCCl**.

3. **Size and Polarity**:
   - **ClCCl** is smaller than **ClCCCl** but similarly polar due to the two chlorines. Smaller size may not significantly deviate the property from the trend.

4. **Conclusion**:
   The property value for **ClCCl** is likely very close to **ClCCCl** and **CCCC**, which both have **-0.85201745**.

### Predicted Property Value for **ClCCl**:  
**-0.85201745**

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.42340584122202374
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify structural patterns that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - **Oc1ccccc1** (phenol) has a property value of **0.92158566**.
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol) has a value of **0.46361151**.
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (a substituted phenol) has a value of **0.67769405**.
   - Phenol derivatives with electron-donating groups (e.g., alkyl groups) tend to have positive property values, while those with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro) have lower or negative values.

2. **Methyl Substitution**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene) is not in the dataset, but alkylated aromatics (e.g., **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O**) tend to increase the property value compared to unsubstituted analogs.
   - The molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is a dimethyl-substituted phenol (2,6-dimethylphenol or similar), which is structurally similar to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** but with slightly less steric bulk.

3. **Hydroxy Group Impact**:
   - The presence of an **-OH** group on an aromatic ring generally increases the property value unless paired with strong electron-withdrawing groups.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (property = **0.67769405**), but with slightly less steric hindrance (methyl instead of isopropyl), we can expect the property value for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** to be slightly higher. 

A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **0.70 to 0.75**. Averaging this with the phenol baseline (~0.92) and accounting for the dimethyl substitution, a plausible prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 0.72**  

*(This aligns with the trend of alkylated phenols having moderately high positive values in the dataset.)*

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.807937415098262
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property seems to correlate with molecular features such as halogenation (especially chlorine substitution), aromaticity, and molecular complexity. 

The molecule in question is:  
**Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**  

This is a highly chlorinated biphenyl-like structure (similar to polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs). From the examples, we observe that heavily chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have high positive property values (e.g., **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c2ccccc2)c(Cl)c1Cl** has a value of **0.95278873**, and **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** has a value of **0.93345124**).  

The given molecule has **5 chlorine atoms** and a **biphenyl core**, which is structurally similar to the examples above. Given the trend, I predict its property value will be **slightly lower** than the most heavily chlorinated examples but still high.  

### Predicted property value:  
**~0.92**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. The value likely falls between **0.90 and 0.95**, similar to the other polychlorinated aromatics in the examples.)  

Would you like me to refine this further based on additional reasoning?
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.9609833078664957
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural and functional group trends that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Alkenes**:
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): Property = **-0.26562394**
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane): Property = **0.51236635**
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): Property = **-0.78623584**
   - **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene) is a branched alkene, similar to the above but with a double bond.

2. **Branched vs. Linear Hydrocarbons**:
   - Branched hydrocarbons tend to have lower (more negative) property values compared to linear ones (e.g., octane vs. branched alkanes).
   - The presence of a double bond (as in nonene) reduces the property value compared to saturated analogs (e.g., octane).

3. **Specific Comparisons**:
   - **CC=C(C)C** is structurally similar to **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (both are branched) but with fewer carbons and a double bond.
   - The double bond may slightly increase the property value compared to fully saturated branched chains (e.g., **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** has **-0.786**, but **CCCCCCCCC=C** has **-0.265**).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Branched alkanes have very negative values (e.g., **-0.786** for **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**).
- Adding a double bond tends to raise the value (e.g., **-0.265** for **CCCCCCCCC=C** vs. **0.512** for **CCCCCCCC**).
- **CC=C(C)C** is a smaller branched alkene, so its value should be between the branched alkane and linear alkene examples.

A reasonable estimate is slightly higher than **-0.786** but lower than **-0.265**. Splitting the difference, I predict:

**Predicted property value for CC=C(C)C: -0.45**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on trends in the data. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or additional data would be needed.)

Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.815643378952793
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The molecule in question is **ClCCl** (dichloromethane). 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatics**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorines on aromatic rings (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`, `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) tend to have positive property values, often in the range of **0.4 to 0.9**.
   - However, `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl` has a negative value (-0.85398404), suggesting that the arrangement of chlorines and other substituents (like ether linkages) can significantly affect the property.

2. **Small Chlorinated Aliphatics**:
   - `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) has a property value of **-0.55274738**.
   - `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` (a complex polychlorinated aliphatic) has a high positive value (0.95000616), but this is likely due to its size and complexity.

3. **Dichloromethane (ClCCl)**:
   - This is a simple, small, and symmetric chlorinated aliphatic molecule. 
   - Compared to `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl`, which has more chlorines and unsaturation, `ClCCl` is less polarizable and less likely to exhibit strong interactions that would lead to high positive or negative values.
   - The property value is likely to be closer to zero but slightly negative due to the electronegativity of the chlorines and the lack of aromaticity or other stabilizing features.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, the property value for **ClCCl** is predicted to be in the range of **-0.3 to -0.6**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**-0.45** (specific predicted value). 

This aligns with the behavior of small chlorinated aliphatics in the dataset, where simpler structures tend toward modest negative values unless they are part of larger or more complex systems.

Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.5933819566095485
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** `Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl`  
This is a chlorinated phenol derivative with three chlorine substituents on the aromatic ring and a hydroxyl group (-OH). 

From the examples, we see that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have negative property values, especially when combined with polar groups like -OH. For instance:
- `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` (a similar trichlorophenol) has a property value of **-0.84104393**.
- `OC1C=CC2C1C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl` (a polychlorinated structure) has a value of **-0.84571162**.
- `ClCC` (a simple chloroalkane) has a value of **-0.81564338**.

The presence of multiple electronegative chlorine atoms and the -OH group likely contributes to a negative property value, consistent with the trend observed in the examples. 

Given the similarity to `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` (-0.84104393), the property value for `Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl` should be very close. The slight difference in substitution pattern (meta vs. para) may not significantly alter the value.

### Predicted Property Value:  
**-0.84** (approximately matching the trend for polychlorinated phenols in the dataset). 

For higher precision, we might estimate **-0.843** (interpolating between similar structures), but the closest match from the examples is **-0.84104393**. Thus, the prediction is confidently near this value. 

**Final answer:**  
**-0.841** (aligning closely with the observed trend for analogous molecules).

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -0.8550951013066205
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to predict the property value.

### Molecule to Predict:
**SMILES:** `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67`

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments:**
   - Multiple **ether linkages (O-R)** and **hydroxyl groups (-OH)**: These are polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding, which may increase the property value (as seen in molecules with many -OH groups like `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` with a high value of 0.82987636).
   - **Aromatic rings with methoxy (-OCH3) and hydroxyl (-OH) substitutions**: These are electron-rich and polar, similar to some examples with positive property values.
   - **Lactone (cyclic ester) fragment (COC2=O)**: This is polar and may contribute positively.
   - **Fused ring systems**: The molecule has multiple fused rings, which can add complexity and influence the property. Some polycyclic examples have positive values (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` with 0.12513429).
   - **Glycosidic-like linkages (e.g., OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)**: These are similar to sugar-like structures, which often have positive property values due to high polarity (e.g., `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` with 0.82987636).
   - **Dioxolane (OCOc5cc67)**: This is a polar cyclic ether, which may increase the property value.

2. **Comparison to Examples:**
   - The molecule is most similar to highly oxygenated, polar structures like `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (property = 0.82987636) and `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` (property = 0.12513429).
   - It has more complexity and polarity than most negative examples (e.g., simple hydrocarbons or halides with negative values).

3. **Potential Contributions:**
   - The high number of oxygen atoms and polar functional groups suggest a positive property value.
   - The fused ring systems and size of the molecule may moderate the value compared to smaller, simpler polar molecules.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above analysis, the molecule is likely to have a **positive property value**, similar to other highly oxygenated, polar, and complex structures in the examples. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **0.5 to 0.8**. 

For specificity, I will predict:  
**Predicted Property Value: 0.654**  

This is based on its similarity to highly polar, polyoxygenated examples (e.g., sugars and polycyclic oxygenates) while accounting for its larger size and mixed functional groups.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.28318666895030337
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly negative values (close to -0.8)**:
   - Often associated with polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., amides, alcohols, halogens like Cl/Br in certain contexts).
   - Example: `CC(=O)OCC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3C(O)CC21C` (-0.84898901) has multiple carbonyl and hydroxyl groups.
   - Example: `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (-0.81368001) has a thioamide and tert-butyl group, similar to our target molecule.

2. **Highly positive values (close to +0.9)**:
   - Often associated with aromatic systems, especially polycyclic aromatics or electron-rich rings (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24` = 0.94628363).
   - Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) can sometimes increase the value (e.g., `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3` = 0.96948903).

3. **Neutral or intermediate values**:
   - Aliphatic chains or simple halogens tend to have values around -0.4 to +0.4 unless combined with other features.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is:  
**CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**  
- It contains a **thioamide (C=S)** and **amide (C=O)** group, which are polar and often correlate with negative values.
- It has a **tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)**, which is bulky and hydrophobic but doesn't strongly influence polarity.
- The **triazole ring (nnc)** is aromatic but not as electron-rich as polycyclic aromatics, so it won't contribute strongly to positive values.
- The **N-H group** can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may further lower the value.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` has a similar structure (thioamide + tert-butyl) and a value of **-0.81368001**.
- `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1` (similar polar groups) has a value of **-0.66258864**.
- The presence of sulfur (C=S) and the triazole ring may slightly modulate the value compared to these examples.

### Prediction:
Given the strong similarity to `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (-0.81368001) and the polar/hydrogen-bonding features, the predicted property value for **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C** is likely in the range of **-0.75 to -0.85**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.79** (specific value chosen based on the closest structural match). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.79**
==================================================
Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.4325209289481938
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question (**CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**), let's break down the structural features and compare them to the provided data to predict the property value.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings (e.g., benzene)**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) tend to have property values in the range of **-0.8 to 0.9**, depending on substituents.
   - Example: `Nc1ccccc1` has a value of **-0.46277191**, while `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has **0.92263595** (due to the strongly electron-withdrawing nitro group).

2. **Esters (R-COOR')**:
   - Esters like `COCC(=O)OC` or `CCCC(=O)OCC` have values ranging from **-0.85421157** to **0.19447998**, depending on the rest of the structure.
   - The presence of an ester group alone does not strictly determine the value, but larger/aliphatic esters tend to push the value toward the positive side.

3. **Ethyl Group (CCO-)**: 
   - Ethyl-substituted molecules (e.g., `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1`) are not directly in the examples, but similar structures like `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2` have a value of **0.46033829**. However, this molecule is more complex with additional functional groups.

4. **Phenyl Acetate Derivatives**:
   - The closest simple analog in the examples is `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (diphenyl ether), which has a high value of **0.92158566**, but this lacks the ester group.
   - Another somewhat similar molecule is `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (a benzofuranone derivative) with a value of **-0.47020864**.

### Structure of **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**:
This is **ethyl benzoate**, consisting of:
- A benzene ring (`c1ccccc1`),
- An ester group (`CCOC(=O)-`) attached to it.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Simple aromatic esters in the examples (like `COCC(=O)OC`) have values around **-0.85421157**,
- But larger/aliphatic esters (like `CCCC(=O)OCC`) have values closer to **0.19447998**,
- The benzene ring alone (without strongly electron-donating/withdrawing groups) tends to moderate the value toward the middle of the range.

The ester group here is not as large as in `CCCC(=O)OCC`, but it's also not as small as in `COCC(=O)OC`. The benzene ring likely pulls the value toward the negative side, but not extremely so.

### Estimated Value:
A reasonable prediction for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** would be around **-0.4 to 0.1**. Looking at the examples, a plausible specific value is:

**Predicted property value: -0.35**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples. The actual value may vary slightly depending on the exact property being modeled, but this is a reasonable estimate given the data.)
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.5123663462813367
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property of **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane):

1. **Alkyl Chains with Halogens**: 
   - **CI** (iodomethane) has a property value of **-0.82914606**, which is quite negative. This suggests that small halogenated alkanes (especially with heavy halogens like I or Br) tend to have negative property values.
   - However, longer alkyl chains with halogens (like **CCCCCCCBr**) may behave differently because the hydrophobic alkyl chain can dominate the property.

2. **Long Alkyl Chains**:
   - **CCCCCCCO** (1-octanol) has a property value of **0.51236635**, which is positive. This suggests that longer alkyl chains (even with polar groups like -OH) can have positive property values.
   - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-heptene) has a property value of **-0.76267521**, which is negative, but this is an alkene (not directly comparable to an alkane).

3. **Bromine Substitution**:
   - Bromine is less electronegative than chlorine but still introduces polarity. The effect of Br in a long chain is likely less pronounced than in small molecules like **CI**.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCCCCCCBr** is structurally similar to **CCCCCCCO** (replace -OH with -Br). Since -Br is less polar than -OH but still introduces some polarity, the property value might be slightly lower than **0.51236635** but still positive.

### Predicted Property for **CCCCCCCBr**:
Given the above reasoning, the property value is likely in the range of **0.3 to 0.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.45** (specific value chosen based on interpolation of similar molecules). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.8291460635282811
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's a breakdown of relevant observations:

1. **Simple alkanes/alkyl groups**: 
   - `CCC` (propane) has a value of -0.81564338.
   - `CCBr` (similar size to propane, just Br instead of H) also has -0.81564338, suggesting that simple halogen substitution doesn't drastically change the property for small molecules.

2. **Oxygen-containing small molecules**:
   - `CCCCOC=O` (butyraldehyde) has a value of 0.03570354.
   - `OC1CCCCCC1` (cyclohexanol) has a higher value of 0.89358595 due to the hydroxyl group in a cyclic structure.
   - `COC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1` (methyl salicylate) has -0.06820911, showing that aromatic oxygenated compounds can have negative values.

3. **Methanol (`CO`)**:
   - This is the simplest alcohol, with just a single hydroxyl group attached to methane.
   - Compared to `CCC` (propane), methanol is more polar and has hydrogen bonding capability, which likely increases its property value relative to propane.
   - Compared to `CCCCOC=O` (butyraldehyde), methanol is smaller and less complex but has a similar polar character due to the -OH group.

Given these observations, methanol (`CO`) is a small, polar molecule with hydrogen bonding capability. Its property value should be higher than propane (-0.81564338) but likely lower than larger oxygenated molecules like butyraldehyde (0.03570354) or cyclohexanol (0.89358595). 

A reasonable estimate for methanol would be slightly negative but closer to zero than propane, reflecting its polarity but small size. 

**Predicted property value for `CO`: -0.3** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The value is likely in the range of -0.4 to 0.1, with -0.3 being a plausible midpoint.)
