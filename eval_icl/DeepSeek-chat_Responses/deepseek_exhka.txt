SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.484796331322129
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the analysis:

1. **Alkanes and simple hydrocarbons** (e.g., `CC=C`, `CC(C)C`, `CCCCCC`) tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., 0.94, 1.50, 1.50). The value increases with chain length but plateaus for longer chains.

2. **Molecules with polar or functional groups** (e.g., `C=CC=O`, `CN(C)C(=O)C...`, `CN(C=Nc1...)`) tend to have **negative property values**, especially if they contain nitrogen, oxygen, or aromatic systems.

3. **Halogenated compounds** (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Br)c1`, `ClC1C(Cl)...`) tend to have **very high positive values**, especially with multiple halogens.

4. **Esters** (e.g., `CCOC(=O)CC`, `CCCCCCCC(=O)OC`) have **moderate positive values** around **0.48–0.81**.

The molecule in question is:  
**`CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`**  

This is a long-chain ester (decanoyl methyl ester, or similar). Comparing it to similar examples:
- `CCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (octanoyl methyl ester) has a value of **0.48479633**.
- `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (longer chain) would likely have a **similar or slightly higher value** due to increased hydrophobicity.

However, another example, `CCCCCCCC(=O)C` (ketone, not ester) has a value of **0.81120822**, suggesting esters may be slightly lower.  

Given the trends, the predicted property value for **`CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`** is:  
**≈ 0.48–0.50**  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**0.48479633** (same as the shorter-chain ester, as the property may not scale linearly with chain length).  

Thus, the predicted value is:  
**0.48479633**

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.2693211097287046
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **benzofuran-2-one-like** structure (a benzene fused to a lactone-like ring with an NH group). Specifically:
   - A benzene ring with a chlorine substituent (`Clc2ccc...`).
   - Fused to a 5-membered ring containing a lactam-like moiety (`oc(=O)[nH]`), which resembles a cyclic amide (similar to uracil or hydantoin derivatives in the examples).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Aryl chloride (`Cl` attached to benzene).
   - Lactam (`oc(=O)[nH]`), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
   - No aliphatic chains or highly hydrophobic groups.

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Lactam/Cyclic Urea Analogues**: 
  - Molecules like `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC` and `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)` have property values around **-0.39**. These contain cyclic ureas/amides and are somewhat polar.
  - The presence of the lactam in our molecule suggests a similar polarity, but the aromatic chlorine may increase the value slightly.

- **Aryl Chlorides**:
  - Molecules like `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` and `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` have values around **0.69**. These are less polar due to multiple chlorines but lack the polar lactam.
  - Our molecule has only one chlorine but adds a polar lactam, which may balance the effect.

- **Hybrid Cases**:
  - `Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C` has a value of **-0.11**. This is a chlorinated uracil derivative with bulky groups, somewhat similar to our molecule but more sterically hindered.
  - Our molecule lacks bulky alkyl groups, so the value may be closer to the lactam examples.

### Prediction:
Given the polar lactam and the single chlorine, the property value is likely between the cyclic amide examples (~-0.39) and the aryl chloride examples (~0.69). A reasonable estimate is slightly positive due to the chlorine but tempered by the polar lactam. 

**Predicted Property Value: ~0.25**

However, looking more closely at the examples, the molecule `Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C` (with a chlorinated uracil-like core) has a value of **-0.11**, and our molecule is simpler (no bulky tert-butyl groups). Thus, the value might be slightly higher than -0.11 but less than 0.69. 

A more precise estimate is **~0.15**.

But reviewing the data again, the closest structural analogue is likely the uracil-like systems with values around **-0.1 to 0.0**. Given the chlorine, I'll adjust slightly upward.

**Final Predicted Property Value: 0.10** (rounded to two decimal places). 

However, given the variability in the examples, another plausible estimate is **0.0** (similar to `c1cncnc1`, which is a simple aromatic heterocycle). 

After reconsidering, the most consistent prediction is **0.0**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted Property Value: 0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.384253091872139
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitrate/Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - The molecule **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** has a property value of **-0.41753709**.
   - The nitro group here is attached to a heterocyclic ring, but the presence of the nitro group seems to contribute to a negative property value.

2. **Alkyl Chains**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCOCC**, **CCCCCl**) tend to have positive property values (e.g., 1.40757086, 2.31568671).
   - However, when polar or electronegative groups (like nitro) are attached, the property value becomes less positive or negative.

3. **Hybrid Cases**:
   - **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is a nitroalkane with a branched alkyl group (isopropyl). 
   - Compared to **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO**, the nitro group here is attached to a simpler alkyl chain, which might reduce the negative impact slightly.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Nitro groups tend to decrease the property value (negative contribution).
- Branched alkyl chains (like isopropyl) are less polar than aromatic systems but still have some positive contribution.

The property value for **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is likely **less negative** than **-0.41753709** (from the nitro-heterocycle example) but still negative due to the nitro group's strong effect. 

A reasonable estimate would be around:  
**-0.25 to -0.35**.  

For specificity, let's choose:  
**Predicted property value: -0.30**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. If the property is something like "logP" or "dipole moment," the reasoning might differ slightly.)  

---  
**Final answer: -0.30** (approximate).  

If you can clarify the property (e.g., logP, polarizability, etc.), the prediction can be refined further.

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: -0.07937162924798269
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided.

### Key Observations:
1. **Steroid-like structure**: The molecule has a polycyclic (steroid-like) framework with multiple rings, similar to the example:
   - **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C**, which has a property value of **0.0**.

2. **Functional groups**:
   - **Carbonyl (C=O)**: Present in the form of a ketone (C(=O)) and an aldehyde (C(=O)CO). Carbonyl groups are polar and can influence the property value.
   - **Hydroxyl (OH)**: The presence of an alcohol group (CC(O)) adds polarity.
   - **No halogens or strongly electron-withdrawing groups**: Unlike some examples with halogens (Cl, Br, I) that increase the property value significantly, this molecule lacks such groups.

3. **Comparison to similar molecules**:
   - The steroid-like example with **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** has a value of **0.0**, but it lacks the hydroxyl and aldehyde groups.
   - Molecules with hydroxyl groups (e.g., **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**) tend to have slightly negative values (e.g., **-0.16183538**).
   - The additional polarity from the hydroxyl and aldehyde groups in the given molecule suggests a slight decrease from the steroid-like baseline of **0.0**.

4. **No extreme features**:
   - No highly electron-withdrawing (e.g., NO2) or bulky hydrophobic groups (e.g., long alkyl chains) are present to push the value significantly higher or lower.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the steroid-like core (which would suggest ~0.0) and the added polarity from the hydroxyl and aldehyde groups (which would slightly reduce the value), the predicted property value is likely slightly negative but close to zero. 

**Predicted value: -0.2** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The value is likely in the range of **-0.1 to -0.3**.) 

For a more precise prediction, the exact property being modeled would need to be known. However, based on the provided data, **-0.2** is a reasonable estimate.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: -0.8419356367034838
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). 
   - From the examples, aromatic rings with halogens (e.g., Cl, Br, F) often have property values in the range of **-0.06 to 1.25**, depending on the number and type of halogens and other functional groups.
   - Example: `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a value of **1.05863226**, and `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` has **-0.08888134**.

2. **Amide groups**: The molecule has two amide linkages (`C(=O)N`).
   - Example: `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` (thiourea-like) has **-0.16183538**, and `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` has **-0.38484537**. This suggests amides/ureas tend to lower the property value.

3. **Halogen substitutions**: 
   - Fluorine substitutions (`Fc1cccc(F)c1`): Example `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` has **-0.06977241**, indicating fluorine may slightly decrease the value.
   - Chlorine substitution (`ccc(Cl)cc`): Example `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has **1.05863226**, suggesting chlorine increases the value.

4. **Combined effects**:
   - The molecule is a hybrid of aromatic rings with halogens and amide groups. The amides likely dominate, pulling the value toward the negative range, but the chlorine may offset this slightly.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` (thiourea + phenyl): **-0.16183538**
- `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (amide + pyridine): **-0.38484537**
- `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (dichlorobenzene): **1.05863226**

Given the two amide groups and the presence of halogens, the property value is likely slightly negative but higher than simple amides due to the chlorine. 

### Predicted Value:
A reasonable estimate is **-0.2 to 0.2**. Given the examples, a specific prediction could be:
**-0.16183538** (similar to `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` but adjusted slightly for the additional amide and fluorine).

However, the chlorine may push it closer to zero. A more precise estimate is:
**-0.08888134** (similar to `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1`, adjusted for amides).

After balancing these effects, the predicted value is:
**-0.12** (intermediate between the amide and halogen influences).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2** is:
**-0.12** (approximate, based on structural analogies). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data. The value likely represents a molecular descriptor like logP, polarizability, or a similar physicochemical property.)

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 1.4075708577080217
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl propyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Ethers:**
   - Molecules with simple hydrocarbon chains or ethers tend to have positive property values, especially if they are non-polar or weakly polar.
   - Example: `CCCCCC1CCCC1` (cyclic hydrocarbon) has a value of **1.50328858**.
   - Example: `CCOC(=O)CC` (ethyl propanoate) has a value of **0.48479633** (lower due to the ester group).
   - Example: `CCCCCO` (1-pentanol) has a value of **1.40757086** (despite the -OH group, the long hydrocarbon chain dominates).

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups:**
   - Ethers (`-O-`) without other polar groups often have values similar to hydrocarbons.
   - Example: `CC1CCCO1` (tetrahydrofuran derivative) has a value of **1.40757086**.
   - Example: `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (tertiary alcohol) has a value of **1.40757086**.

3. **Branching:**
   - Branching (e.g., isopropyl groups) does not significantly lower the value if the molecule is still largely non-polar.
   - Example: `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` (branched hydrocarbon) has a value of **1.50328858**.

4. **Specific Case for CCCOC(C)C:**
   - This is an ether with a propyl group (`CCC-`) and an isopropyl group (`-OC(C)C`).
   - It lacks strongly polar or aromatic groups, so the value should be similar to other non-polar/aliphatic ethers or alcohols.
   - The closest examples are `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (1.40757086) and `CCCCCO` (1.40757086).

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to molecules with values around **1.40757086**, the predicted property value for **CCCOC(C)C** is:

**1.40757086**

Iteration: 7
SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.08554858052557532
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **bromine (Br)** substituent, which is electronegative and often increases the property value (e.g., see `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` with Br-like halogens contributing to higher values).
   - It has a **lactam-like structure** (cyclic amide with C=O and NH) and an additional carbonyl (C=O), which are polar and may lower the property value (e.g., similar to `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` with multiple carbonyls and amides).
   - An **alkyl group (CCC(C))** is present, which typically increases the property value (e.g., see `CCC(C)CC` with a high value).

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **halogens (Br/Cl)** and **polar groups (C=O, NH)** often have property values in the range of **-0.5 to 0.5** (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` has a value of 0.09670002).
   - The presence of **two carbonyls and a Br** suggests a balance between polar effects (lowering the value) and halogen effects (raising it slightly).
   - The **alkyl group** may push the value slightly higher.

3. **Closest Analogues**:
   - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (0.09670002): Similar Br and polar carbonyl but simpler structure.
   - `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3` (-0.70700742): Polar/aromatic but no halogen.
   - `CC23Cc1cnoc1C=C2CCC4C3CCC5(C)C4CCC5(O)C#C` (-0.47850112): Complex but with polar and nonpolar regions.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between **Br (increases value)**, **two carbonyls and NH (decrease value)**, and **alkyl group (increases value)**, the property value is likely **slightly negative but close to zero**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.25**  

This aligns with the trend where polar/halogenated molecules with moderate complexity fall in this range.
==================================================
Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.49570417369961994
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), we can infer the following trends to predict the property:

1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, naphthalene) tend to have negative property values. For example:
     - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (coronene) has a value of **-0.95929488**.
     - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a polyaromatic amine) has **-0.858269**.
   - Biphenyl consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, which is less conjugated/extended than fused polyaromatics like naphthalene or coronene.

2. **Substituent Effects**:
   - The presence of electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂, Cl) or polar functional groups (e.g., OH, COOH) can modulate the property, but biphenyl has no substituents.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (methyl-substituted naphthalene) has a value of **-0.32924667**, which is less negative than fused polyaromatics but still negative.
   - **C1CCc2ccccc2C1** (tetralin, partially saturated naphthalene) has **0.15405144**, showing that reduced aromaticity increases the property value.

4. **Biphenyl Specifics**:
   - Biphenyl is less conjugated than naphthalene but more aromatic than isolated benzene rings. Its property value should be between that of benzene (not explicitly given but inferred from trends) and naphthalene derivatives.
   - Given that **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (methyl-naphthalene) is **-0.32924667**, biphenyl (no methyl groups, less conjugation) should be slightly less negative.

### Predicted Property Value for **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2**:
**-0.25** (estimated based on the above reasoning). 

This places it between simpler aromatics (like toluene or benzene, which would likely be closer to zero) and fused polyaromatics (which are more negative). The lack of substituents and intermediate conjugation level justifies this prediction.
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 2.513129961462533
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCS** (butyl mercaptan or 1-butanethiol), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, cycloalkanes, aromatics)**:
   - Linear/branched alkanes (e.g., `CCCC(=C)C`, `CCCCCC(C)C`) tend to have values around **0.94–1.50**.
   - Cycloalkanes (e.g., `C1CCC2CCCCC2C1`, `CCC1CCCCC1`) consistently have a value of **1.50328858**.
   - Aromatics (e.g., `c1ccc2ccccc2c1`) have negative values (e.g., **-0.32924667**).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., alcohols, ethers, carbonyls)**:
     - Alcohols (e.g., `CC(O)C(C)(C)C`, `OC1CCCCCCC1`) have values around **1.40757086**.
     - Ethers (e.g., `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1`) tend to have negative values (e.g., **-0.46676087**).
   - **Nitrogen-containing groups (e.g., amines, amides, nitro)**:
     - Generally reduce the property value (e.g., `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has **0.26430298**, while `NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` has **-0.59882538**).
   - **Sulfur-containing groups**:
     - Thiols/sulfides (e.g., `CCCCS` is not explicitly in the examples, but sulfur appears in other contexts):
       - `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O` has **1.65376123**, but this is a complex thiophosphate.
       - `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has **4.30502024**, but this is a phosphorodithioate.
       - Simpler sulfur-containing molecules like `Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1` have **0.02078989**.
     - Sulfur seems to introduce variability, but simple thiols may align closer to alkanes with a slight reduction.

3. **Halogens (Cl, Br, I)**:
   - Chlorinated aromatics (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`) have values like **0.26430298**.
   - Highly chlorinated aliphatics (e.g., `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2`) have **0.68994708**.
   - Iodine (e.g., `CC(C)I`) drastically increases the value to **4.05772219**.

4. **Hybrid Cases**:
   - Molecules with mixed features (e.g., `CCc1cccc(C)c1N(C(C)COC)C(=O)CCl`) have intermediate values (e.g., **-0.13511626**).

### Prediction for `CCCCS`:
- `CCCCS` is a simple aliphatic thiol (1-butanethiol). Structurally, it resembles linear alkanes (e.g., `CCCC(=C)C` with **0.94068764**) but with a sulfur substitution.
- Sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, so its effect is less polarizing than alcohols (which have ~1.407). 
- Given the examples, sulfur in simpler contexts does not drastically alter the value compared to hydrocarbons. 
- The closest analog is likely `CCCC(=C)C` (0.94), but with sulfur slightly reducing the value due to its moderate polarity.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable prediction for `CCCCS` is:  
**~0.85** (slightly lower than a linear alkane due to the thiol group).

### Final Answer:
**0.85** (approximate, based on analogous examples).
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1.4075708577080217
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains with Hydroxyl Groups (-OH):**
   - **CCCC(C)(O)CC**: Property = 1.40757086  
     (This is a branched hydrocarbon with a hydroxyl group at a secondary carbon.)
   - **CCCCOC**: Property = 1.40757086  
     (This is a linear hydrocarbon with an ether group, but the value matches the hydroxyl-containing example, suggesting the hydroxyl group dominates.)
   - **CC(C)CC(C)O**: Property = 1.40757086  
     (Another branched hydrocarbon with a terminal -OH group.)

   These examples suggest that **branched or linear hydrocarbons with a hydroxyl group (-OH)** tend to have a property value of **~1.40757086**.

2. **Branched Hydrocarbons Without -OH:**
   - **CCC(C)(C)C**: Property = 1.50328858  
     (Branched hydrocarbon without -OH, slightly higher value.)
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**: Property = 1.50328858  
     (Similar branched hydrocarbon without -OH.)

   This suggests that **branched hydrocarbons without -OH** have a slightly higher value (~1.50328858).

3. **Impact of -OH:**
   The presence of -OH seems to reduce the property value slightly compared to similar hydrocarbons without -OH (from ~1.503 to ~1.407).

### Analysis of **CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
- The structure is a branched hydrocarbon (**CCCC(C)(C)**) with a terminal hydroxyl group (**-CO**).
- This is very similar to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (property = 1.40757086), except the -OH is at the end of the chain rather than in the middle. However, the position of -OH does not seem to significantly affect the value in the given examples (e.g., **CC(C)CC(C)O** also has the same value).
- The presence of -OH suggests the value should be closer to **1.40757086** rather than the higher value for branched hydrocarbons without -OH (~1.503).

### Predicted Property:
Based on the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is:

**1.40757086**

Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is a **methyl-substituted naphthalene** (specifically, 1-methylnaphthalene). It consists of a naphthalene core (two fused benzene rings) with a methyl group (-CH3) attached to one of the rings.

7. **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (1-methylnaphthalene, very similar to the target molecule): Property = **-0.62617817**

### Observations:
- Simple benzene derivatives with methyl groups (e.g., toluene, xylene, trimethylbenzene) consistently have a property value of **~0.154**.
- The naphthalene core (without substituents) is not explicitly given, but the closest analog is **1-methylnaphthalene (Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1)**, which has a property value of **-0.62617817**.
- The target molecule (**Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**) is also **1-methylnaphthalene** (just drawn with a slightly different numbering convention). 

### Prediction:
Since the target molecule is structurally identical to the given **1-methylnaphthalene** example, its property value should be the same. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is **-0.62617817**.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: -0.5445053723860819
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (two amide groups attached to a 5-membered ring, O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is polar and likely contributes negatively to the property value (as seen in similar structures like `C(=O)NC(=O)NC(=O)` in other examples).
   - Example: `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C` has a property value of **-0.54450537**.  
   This suggests the hydantoin core is associated with negative values.

2. **Substituents**:  
   - The core is substituted with a **branched alkyl group (C(C)CCC)** and a **vinyl group (CC=C)**.  
   - Alkyl groups (e.g., `CC=C` or `C(C)CCC`) tend to increase the property value (as seen in molecules like `CC=C(C)`, `CCCC`, etc., which have positive values when dominant).  
   - However, the polar hydantoin core likely dominates, keeping the value negative.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:  
   - The closest analog in the examples is `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C` (**-0.54450537**).  
   - Here, the substituent is larger (`C(C)CCC` instead of just `C`), which would slightly increase the property value (less negative) due to the hydrophobic contribution of the longer alkyl chain.

### Predicted Property:
Given the larger alkyl substituent compared to the reference molecule, the property value should be **less negative** but still in the same range. A reasonable estimate would be slightly higher (closer to zero) than **-0.54450537**.

**Predicted value: -0.50** (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity, but the exact value would likely be between -0.54 and -0.45 based on the trend).

### Justification:
- The hydantoin core dominates, keeping the value negative.  
- The larger alkyl group offsets this slightly, making it less negative than the reference molecule.  
- No strongly polar or charged groups (e.g., NO2, SO3H) are present to push the value further negative.  

Thus, the predicted property value for **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C** is approximately **-0.50**. 

(Note: Without a more precise quantitative model, this is an educated estimate based on structural similarity and trends in the data.)

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.06977241400842392
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Key Observations:
1. **Hydrophobicity/LogP Trends**:
   - The property values seem to correlate with **logP (partition coefficient)**, where higher values indicate greater hydrophobicity (lipophilicity), and lower/negative values indicate hydrophilicity or polarity.
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., `CCCCC`, `C1CCCC1`) have high values (~1.50), indicating hydrophobicity.
   - Polar or functionalized molecules (e.g., esters, carboxylic acids, nitro groups) have negative values (e.g., `COC(=O)c1cccnc1` = -0.38).
   - Aromatic rings alone (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54`) have moderately negative values (~-0.81 to -0.87), but substitution with hydrophobic groups (e.g., alkyl chains) increases the value (e.g., `CCc1ccccc1CC` = 0.15).

2. **Halogen Effects**:
   - Chlorinated aromatics (e.g., `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` = 2.16, `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` = 1.98) have very high values due to halogen hydrophobicity.
   - Bromine substitution (`Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` = 0.53) is less hydrophobic than chlorine but still increases the value compared to unsubstituted aromatics.

3. **Fluorine-Specific Trends**:
   - Fluorine is more electronegative and often reduces hydrophobicity compared to other halogens (due to its smaller size and weaker lipophilicity contribution).
   - No direct fluorine examples are given, but comparing with chlorine/bromine trends, we expect **fluorinated aromatics to have lower values than chlorinated analogs**.

### Prediction for `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1`:
- The molecule is **benzene substituted with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3)**.
- The **-CF3 group is moderately hydrophobic** but less so than -Cl or -Br due to fluorine's properties.
- Aromatic rings alone have negative values, but -CF3 will increase the value compared to unsubstituted benzene (likely still negative or near zero).
- No exact matches in the examples, but similar molecules:
  - `COc1ccccc1O` (methoxyphenol) = -0.24 (polar groups reduce value).
  - `Cc1ccccc1CC` (ethylbenzene) = 0.15 (alkyl increases value).
  - `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` = 2.16 (halogens increase value significantly).

Given that **-CF3 is less hydrophobic than -Cl but more than -OCH3**, and the base aromatic ring is negative, the predicted value should be **slightly positive or near zero**.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: ~0.25**  
*(Rationale: Between the polar -OCH3 (-0.24) and hydrophobic -Cl (2.16), but closer to zero due to fluorine's weaker lipophilicity.)*

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 0.9792682599759074
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar alcohol (likely **sorbitol** or a similar polyol), we can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Hydrophilicity and Hydrogen Bonding**: The molecule has multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups, which are highly polar and capable of extensive hydrogen bonding. This is similar to **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (property value: **0.97926826**), which also has many -OH groups.
2. **Aliphatic Polyols**: Molecules like **CC(C)CCCO** (property: **1.40757086**) and **CCC(C)(O)CC** (property: **1.40757086**) have fewer -OH groups but still show high property values due to their hydrophilicity.
3. **Size and Flexibility**: The cyclic structure of **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** may slightly reduce its flexibility compared to linear polyols, but the presence of multiple -OH groups dominates the property.

### Comparison:
- The closest analog in the dataset is **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (linear form of a hexitol) with a property value of **0.97926826**.
- The cyclic form (as in the given molecule) might have a slightly lower value due to reduced conformational freedom, but the effect is likely small because the -OH groups are still exposed.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong similarity to **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, the predicted property value for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is approximately:

**0.95** (slightly lower than the linear form due to cyclization, but still close to 0.979). 

However, since the dataset shows exact values, I would round this to **0.97** as a conservative estimate. 

But looking at the exact matches for polyols, the value is likely very close to **0.97926826**. For consistency with the given data, I'll predict:

**0.97926826** (same as the linear polyol in the dataset, as cyclization may not significantly alter the property). 

### Final Answer:
**0.97926826**

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: -0.6126939377376655
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural observations:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a polycyclic steroid-like structure with multiple rings (similar to some of the larger molecules in the examples, e.g., `CCC1(=O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C`).
2. **Functional groups**:
   - Two ketone groups (`C=O`).
   - An ester group (`CC(=O)OCC(=O)`).
   - Hydroxyl groups (`C(O)`).
   - A conjugated double bond (`C=CC`).
3. **Size and complexity**: The molecule is large and complex, similar to some of the examples with multiple rings and functional groups.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: This molecule has a steroid-like core with a ketone and ester group. Its property value is **-0.18781405**.
- **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C**: This is another steroid-like molecule with a ketone and hydroxyl group. Its property value is **0.34314092**.
- **CCC1(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCCCC2**: This has a cyclic amide and a ketone, with a value of **-0.54450537**.

### Prediction:
The given molecule has a mix of polar (ketone, ester, hydroxyl) and nonpolar (steroid core) groups, similar to the examples above. The ester and additional hydroxyl groups may increase polarity slightly compared to the first example, but the steroid core dominates. 

Given the similarity to `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (value = -0.18781405) but with additional polar groups, the predicted value would be slightly higher (less negative) due to the extra hydroxyl groups and ester. 

**Predicted property value: -0.10** (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity, but the exact value would likely be between -0.15 and -0.05 based on the examples). 

However, looking more closely, the molecule also resembles `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` (value = 0.34314092), which has a hydroxyl and ketone but no ester. The ester in the given molecule might offset the polarity slightly, so a reasonable estimate is closer to the average of these two examples: 

(-0.18781405 + 0.34314092) / 2 ≈ **0.07766344**.

But given the additional complexity, a more conservative estimate is **0.0** (neutral, balancing polar and nonpolar contributions).

### Final answer:
After careful consideration, the predicted property value for the given molecule is **-0.05**. This reflects a balance between the polar functional groups and the nonpolar steroid core, similar to the examples provided.

Iteration: 16
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 0.7409440640273717
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and overall molecular complexity. The molecule in question is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, hydroxyl groups, and a ketone functionality. 

Key observations from the examples:
1. Molecules with hydroxyl groups (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl`, `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O`) tend to have property values in the range of **-0.1 to 0.3**.
2. Ketones (e.g., `CC1=C(SCCO1)C(=O)Nc2ccccc2`) often contribute to values around **-0.4 to -0.5**.
3. Complex polycyclic structures (e.g., `OC(C1=CC2C5C(C1C2=C(c3ccccc3)c4ccccn4)C(=O)NC5=O)(c6ccccc6)c7ccccn7`) can push values lower (**~-1.0**).
4. The presence of multiple hydroxyls and a ketone in a rigid polycyclic framework (like the given molecule) suggests moderate polarity but significant steric constraints.

The given molecule, `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O`, has:
- A **ketone** (`C=O`),
- A **hydroxyl group** (`OH`),
- A **polycyclic (steroid-like) structure** with significant rigidity.

Comparing this to similar examples (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` with a value of **-0.09830238**), the additional ketone here would likely lower the value slightly further due to increased polarity. 

### Predicted property value: **-0.15** (approximate range: -0.1 to -0.2). 

This aligns with the trend where polycyclic structures with polar groups but no extreme features (e.g., heavy halogenation or highly conjugated systems) fall in this range.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6644298960569611
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH₃-CO-NH-)**: Present in the molecule (CC(=O)N-). 
     - Example with acetamide-like group: `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` has a property value of **0.21415309**.
   - **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Attached to the benzene ring. 
     - Examples with nitro groups:
       - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` has **-0.38484537**.
       - `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has **-0.5069072**.
   - **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The benzene ring is substituted with an acetamide and a nitro group (electron-withdrawing groups).

2. **Polarity and Electron Effects**:
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, reducing electron density on the ring and likely lowering the property value.
   - The acetamide group is moderately polar but less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (methoxy-nitrobenzene) has **-0.5069072**.
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (nitrobenzene) has **-0.38484537**.
   - The addition of the acetamide group (CC(=O)N-) in place of a methoxy or hydrogen will likely make the property value more negative than nitrobenzene but comparable to methoxy-nitrobenzene.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of both an electron-withdrawing nitro group and a polar acetamide group, the property value should be more negative than nitrobenzene (**-0.384**) but similar to methoxy-nitrobenzene (**-0.507**). A reasonable estimate would be between these two values, closer to the methoxy-nitrobenzene due to the acetamide's polarity.

**Predicted property value: -0.45 to -0.55**.  
A specific estimate: **-0.48**.

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at other molecules with similar combinations:
- `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` has **-0.89181489** (more complex, but with nitro and amide).
- `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has **-0.5069072**.

Given the simplicity of the target molecule (acetamido-nitrobenzene), a value slightly less negative than methoxy-nitrobenzene seems appropriate (since -NH- is less electron-donating than -OCH₃).

**Final predicted value: -0.47**.  

However, considering the acetamide group's moderate electron-withdrawing nature, a value closer to **-0.50** is also plausible.  

Given the examples, I would predict:  
**-0.49**.  

But to align more closely with the trend, let's round to:  
**Predicted property value: -0.48**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend of the given data where nitro and polar groups tend to decrease the value.)  

**Final answer: -0.48**.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 0.8656614423717933
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:**  
`CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12`

### Key structural features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (`P(=S)(OCC)`):** This is a polar and moderately electron-withdrawing group. Similar phosphoryl or thiophosphoryl groups in the examples (e.g., `CSSC`, `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1`) are associated with higher positive property values when halogenated or sulfur-containing.
2. **Thiocarbamate linkage (`SCn1c(=O)oc2...`):** The `S-C` bond and the `C=O` in the heterocycle add polarity and potential hydrogen-bonding capacity.
3. **Chlorinated aromatic ring (`cc(Cl)ccc`):** Halogenation (Cl) tends to increase the property value (e.g., `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` has a high value of 1.73222924).
4. **Heterocycle (`n1c(=O)oc2...`):** The presence of a fused heterocyclic system with `N` and `O` atoms introduces polarity and potential negative contributions (e.g., similar heterocycles in the examples have negative values like `-0.5069072` for `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2`).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- `CSSC` (disulfide) has a very high value (3.91480885) due to sulfur.
- `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` (tri-chlorinated benzene) has a high value (1.73222924).
- Molecules with polar groups like `P=O` or `P=S` and halogens tend to have positive values unless balanced by highly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `-0.96317391` for `COC(=O)Nc2nc1ccc(cc1[nH]2)C(=O)c3ccccc3`).

### Prediction:
The molecule combines:
- A phosphorothioate group (positive contribution).
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (positive contribution).
- A polar heterocycle (slight negative contribution).

Given the strong positive contributions from `P=S` and `Cl`, but moderated by the heterocycle, the predicted value is likely in the **range of 1.0 to 2.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.5**  

*(This is an interpolation based on the examples, as no exact match exists in the training set.)*

SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1.4075708577080217
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for molecules with an alcohol (OH) group attached to an aliphatic carbon chain tends to cluster around **1.40757086**. This is observed in multiple examples such as:

- **CCCCCCC(C)O** → 1.40757086  
- **CC(C)CO** → 1.40757086  
- **CCCCCCCC(C)O** → 1.40757086  
- **CCCCC(CC)CO** → 1.40757086  
- **CCCC(O)CCC** → 1.40757086  

The molecule **CC(C)(C)CO** is structurally similar to these examples, as it is a tertiary alcohol (OH group attached to a branched aliphatic chain). There is no significant deviation in the property value for such structures in the given dataset.

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -0.5445053723860819
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, let's analyze its structure and compare it with the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a **purine-like heterocycle** with the following features:
1. **Core structure**: A fused bicyclic system with two nitrogen-containing rings (imidazole and pyrimidine-like).
2. **Functional groups**:
   - A carbonyl group (C=O) at position 1.
   - Two NH groups (imino or amide-like) in the rings.
3. **Aromaticity**: The system is likely aromatic due to conjugated double bonds and lone pairs on nitrogens.

### Comparison with Given Examples:
1. **Similar molecules with fused nitrogen-containing rings**:
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property = -0.60811432): A purine derivative with methoxy substitution.
   - **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (property = -0.39150679): A pyrimidine derivative with carbonyl and fluoro substitution.
   - **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1** (property = -0.34353939): A uracil-like structure with NH and carbonyl groups.
   - **OCC1OC(C(O)C1O)n2cnc3c(O)ncnc23** (property = -0.62172546): A nucleoside-like structure with multiple hydroxyl groups.

2. **Key observations**:
   - Fused nitrogen-containing heterocycles with carbonyl/NH groups tend to have **negative property values** (typically between -0.3 and -0.6).
   - The presence of additional polar groups (e.g., OH, F) slightly modulates the value.
   - The molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** is most similar to **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** but lacks the methoxy group, which may make it slightly less polar.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to the examples above, the property value is likely in the range of **-0.5 to -0.7**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.55**  

This aligns with the trends observed for similar fused nitrogen heterocycles with carbonyl/NH groups in the dataset.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.484796331322129
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Simple aliphatic alcohols/ethers** (e.g., CCCC(C)O, CC(C)O, CCCCCO) consistently have a property value of **1.40757086**.
   - These are neutral, polar molecules with no strong electron-withdrawing or donating groups.
2. **Esters** (e.g., CCOC(=O)C, CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC) have higher values than simple alcohols/ethers but are still positive:
   - CCOC(=O)C (ethyl acetate) is not explicitly listed, but similar esters like CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC have **1.78577987**.
   - The carbonyl (C=O) in esters introduces some polarity but not as dramatically as halogens or aromatic systems.
3. **Methyl acetate (CC(C)OC=O)** is structurally similar to ethyl acetate (CCOC=O) but with a methyl group instead of ethyl. The property value should be close to other esters or slightly lower due to the shorter alkyl chain.

### Comparison:
- **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) has **1.40757086**.
- **CCOC(=O)C** (ethyl acetate) is not listed, but similar esters suggest a value between **1.4 and 1.8**.
- The presence of the ester group (OC=O) likely increases the property slightly compared to simple alcohols.

### Prediction:
Given the examples, **methyl acetate (CC(C)OC=O)** is expected to have a property value slightly higher than simple alcohols but lower than phosphate esters. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.6** (approximate, since exact matches are not provided in the training data). 

However, looking more closely, the closest ester example is **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (1.78577987), which is a phosphate ester (more polar than acetate). For a simple acetate ester like **CC(C)OC=O**, the value is likely slightly lower. 

Given the lack of exact matches, a plausible interpolation suggests:

**Final predicted value: 1.55** (but since the examples show discrete values, the closest match might be **1.40757086** if the ester group's effect is negligible in this context). 

Given the ambiguity, the safest bet is to assign the same value as other simple polar aliphatics: **1.40757086**. 

However, if we consider the ester group's contribution, a value around **1.6** is more accurate. Since no exact ester is listed, I'll lean toward the conservative estimate:

**Predicted property value: 1.40757086** (same as CC(C)O, assuming the ester group's effect is offset by the shorter chain). 

For a more precise answer, additional examples of simple esters would be needed. 

But based on the given data, the most consistent assignment is:

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: -0.7946703568636214
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings and Substituents**:
   - Molecules with simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) and no polar substituents tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative (e.g., `c1ccncc1: 0.074`, `Cc1cccc2ccccc12: -0.329`).
   - Polar or electronegative substituents (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -Br) often decrease the property value (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl: 0.264`, `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl: 3.776`).

2. **Amide Groups (-CONH-)**:
   - Molecules with amide groups (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1: 0.097`, `NC(=O)c1cccnc1: -0.385`) tend to have slightly negative or near-zero property values.
   - The presence of multiple amide groups or conjugated systems with amides may further reduce the property value.

3. **Symmetry and Conjugation**:
   - Symmetrical molecules or those with extended conjugation (e.g., `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2`) often exhibit lower property values due to delocalization effects.

4. **Bulkiness and Flexibility**:
   - Bulky or flexible aliphatic chains (e.g., `C1CCCCC1: 1.503`) tend to increase the property value, while rigid or planar structures (e.g., fused aromatics) decrease it.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** (a diaryl urea derivative) has:
- Two aromatic rings (phenyl groups) linked via urea (-NH-CO-NH-), a polar and conjugated group.
- No strongly electronegative substituents (like -Cl or -Br), but the urea group introduces polarity and hydrogen-bonding potential.
- Symmetry and conjugation across the urea bridge, which likely reduces the property value.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (nicotinamide): Property = `-0.385` (amide + aromatic).
- `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1`: Property = `-0.467` (amide + aromatic + ether).
- `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C`: Property = `-0.392` (cyclic urea with aliphatic substituents).

Given the symmetry and conjugation in **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, its property value is expected to be more negative than simple amides but less negative than highly substituted or polyhalogenated aromatics.

### Predicted Property Value:
Based on the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is approximately **-0.45**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.45** (estimated range: -0.40 to -0.50). 

This aligns with the trend observed for conjugated, symmetrical amide/urea structures in the given examples.

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -0.49570417369961994
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as aromaticity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, which is **fluorene**, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with three fused benzene rings.

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Aromatic systems** with no polar functional groups (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3ccccc4cc3cc2c1` with a value of **-0.80860866**) tend to have negative property values.
2. **Fluorene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13)** is structurally similar to other PAHs in the dataset, such as the example above, which has a value close to **-0.8**.
3. The presence of **no heteroatoms or polar groups** in fluorene suggests it will follow the trend of other purely aromatic hydrocarbons.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to other purely aromatic systems in the dataset, the predicted property value for **fluorene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13)** is approximately **-0.81**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.81** (estimated based on analogous aromatic structures in the dataset).

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -0.5988253755202549
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **NC(=N)N**: A guanidine-like group (basic, polar).
   - **NS(=O)(=O)**: A sulfonamide group (polar, hydrogen-bonding).
   - **Aromatic ring with NH2**: Aniline-like (polar, basic).

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - The molecule has multiple hydrogen bond donors (NH, NH2) and acceptors (SO2, N), making it highly polar.
   - Sulfonamides and anilines in the given examples often correlate with negative property values (e.g., sulfonamides like `CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O` have a value of `-0.23763153`).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - Molecules with sulfonamides and polar groups (e.g., `O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O`, `-0.56989112`) or anilines (e.g., `NNc1ccccc1`, `-0.09830238`) tend to have negative values.
   - The guanidine-like group may further increase polarity, pushing the value more negative.

4. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - The aromatic ring with an NH2 substituent is similar to `NNc1ccccc1` (`-0.09830238`), but the additional sulfonamide group will likely make the value more negative.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the high polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity, the property value is likely in the range of **-0.5 to -0.7**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: -0.62**  

This aligns with the trend observed for polar, hydrogen-bonding sulfonamide-containing molecules in the dataset.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.8818666498830983
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular features such as aromaticity, electronegative substituents (e.g., nitro groups, halogens), hydrogen bonding capability, and overall molecular complexity/polarity. 

The molecule to predict is:  
**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**  

### Key observations about this molecule:  
1. **Highly electronegative substituents**:  
   - Two nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**), which are strongly electron-withdrawing and polar.  
   - A trifluoromethyl group (**C(F)(F)F**), which is also strongly electron-withdrawing.  
   - These substituents will significantly lower the property value (as seen in similar examples like `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` with a value of **-0.5069072**).  

2. **Aromatic ring**:  
   - The presence of a benzene ring with multiple electronegative substituents (similar to `Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl`, which has a value of **-0.06008285**, but this molecule has even more polar groups).  

3. **Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C))**:  
   - This is less polar than the nitro/trifluoromethyl groups but may slightly offset the negative contribution.  

4. **Comparison to similar molecules**:  
   - `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (one nitro group + OH): **-0.5069072**  
   - `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` (nitro + complex heterocycle): **-0.89756396**  
   - `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1` (polar amides + aromatic): **-0.78006366**  

Given that the molecule has **two nitro groups and a CF3 group**, it is significantly more polar/electron-withdrawing than most examples, except perhaps the most complex ones (e.g., steroids with multiple carbonyls).  

### Predicted Property Value:  
Given the strong electron-withdrawing effects, I predict a value close to the most negative examples, likely between **-0.8 and -1.0**.  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.9142**  

This aligns with the trend that highly polar/electron-deficient aromatic systems yield strongly negative values.  

(Note: If the property is logP or a similar descriptor, this would reflect extremely low hydrophobicity due to the polar substituents.)

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.484796331322129
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Alcohols/Ethers with Carbonyls**:
   - **CCCCCC(C)O**: 1.40757086  
     (hexanol-like structure)
   - **CCCCCCCCO**: 1.40757086  
     (octanol-like structure)
   - **CCC(O)CC**: 1.40757086  
     (pentanol-like structure)
   - **OC1CCCCCC1**: 1.40757086  
     (cycloheptanol)
   - **CCC(C)(C)O**: 1.40757086  
     (tertiary alcohol)
   - **CC(C)O**: Likely similar (not explicitly given, but analogous to above).

   These suggest that **aliphatic alcohols/ethers** (even with branching) tend to have a property value around **1.40757086**.

2. **Carbonyl-Containing Compounds**:
   - **CC(=O)N**: 0.48479633  
     (acetamide-like)
   - **CC(=O)O**: Not given, but esters/aldehydes with small chains are often ~0.48-0.81.
   - **CCCC=O**: 0.81120822  
     (butyraldehyde)
   - **O=C1CCCCC1**: 0.81120822  
     (cyclohexanone)
   - **CC(=O)C**: Not given, but likely similar to other carbonyls.

3. **Mixed Functional Groups (Ethers + Carbonyls)**:
   - **CC(C)CCOC=O**: 0.48479633  
     (branched ether + aldehyde)
   - **CCCCCOC(=O)C**: 0.48479633  
     (ester)
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: -0.46676087  
     (aromatic ester, lower due to aromaticity/NH2).

### Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O**:
- This is an **ester** (methyl group + formate group) with branching (isopropyl). 
- Structurally similar to **CC(C)CCOC=O** (property = 0.48479633), which is also a branched ether + carbonyl.
- No aromaticity or electronegative substituents (like Cl, NO2) that would lower the value.
- Small esters/aldehydes without branching (e.g., **CCCC=O**) have higher values (~0.81), but branching seems to reduce the value to ~0.48.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CC(C)CCOC=O** (0.48479633), the property for **CC(C)OC=O** is likely very close to this value. 

### Final Answer:
**0.48479633**

Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.06008285149656904
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Hydroxyl (-OH) Groups**:
   - Molecules with aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups tend to have negative property values. For example:
     - **COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1**: -0.664 (multiple -OH groups)
     - **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**: -0.926 (multiple -OH groups)
     - **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ccccc3**: -0.809 (no -OH, but extended conjugation)
   - The presence of -OH on an aromatic ring seems to lower the property value.

2. **Alkyl Substitutions on Aromatic Rings**:
   - Simple alkyl substitutions (e.g., -CH3) on aromatic rings without polar groups tend to give slightly positive or near-zero values. For example:
     - **CCc1ccccc1C**: 0.154 (two -CH3 groups on aromatic ring)
     - **Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)c2cc(c(Cl)cc2O)S(N)(=O)=O**: -0.732 (complex, but -CH3 alone doesn't dominate)
   - Alkyl groups alone are not strongly negative unless combined with other features.

3. **Combination of -OH and -CH3 on Aromatic Rings**:
   - The molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** has:
     - A benzene ring with two -CH3 groups (one at position 1, one at position 3) and one -OH group (position 4).
     - This is similar to **CCc1ccccc1C** (0.154) but with an added -OH group, which would likely reduce the property value.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol): -0.060 (one -OH on benzene)
   - **Cc1cccc(N)c1**: -0.060 (one -NH2 on toluene, similar to -OH in polarity)
   - The addition of a second -CH3 in **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** would slightly increase hydrophobicity but the -OH would dominate the polarity.

### Prediction:
The molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** has:
- One -OH group (reducing the property value, similar to phenol: -0.060).
- Two -CH3 groups (slightly increasing hydrophobicity, but less impactful than -OH).
- No other strongly negative or positive features (e.g., halogens, nitro groups, etc.).

Given that phenol has a value of -0.060 and adding two -CH3 groups might slightly offset the -OH effect, the predicted value would be close to phenol but slightly less negative due to the alkyl groups. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1: -0.05** (approximately near zero, slightly negative due to -OH). 

However, looking at **Cc1cccc(N)c1** (toluene with -NH2) which is -0.060, and **CCc1ccccc1C** (two -CH3 on aromatic) which is 0.154, the -OH here would likely bring it closer to the phenol value. 

Thus, a more precise estimate would be:  
**-0.10** (accounting for the -OH and two -CH3 groups). 

But given the examples, it's likely closer to the phenol value, so:  
**-0.06** (similar to phenol). 

Given the uncertainty, I'd lean toward:  
**Predicted value: -0.07**. 

However, reviewing the examples again, the closest analog is phenol (-0.060), and adding -CH3 might not change it much, so:  
**Final answer: -0.06**. 

But to be more precise, considering the alkyl groups slightly reduce the polarity, let's say:  
**-0.05**. 

Given the variability, the most reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.06**. 

### Conclusion:
After careful consideration, the predicted property value for **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** is:  
**-0.06**. 

This aligns with the phenol-like structure (-0.060 for phenol) and the slight hydrophobic offset from the two -CH3 groups.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 1.3610403293342181
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: 
   - Molecules with the **P(=S)** group tend to have higher positive property values. For example:
     - **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl**: 3.68536671
     - **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl**: 4.94800786
     - **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: 2.90523321
   - The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) further increases the value, with heavier halogens (I > Br > Cl) correlating with higher values.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**:
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, Br) increase the property value.
   - Aromatic rings with electron-donating groups (e.g., OCH3, CH3) or no substituents tend to decrease or have a neutral effect on the value.

3. **Thioether (SC) Group**:
   - The **SC** group (thioether) is moderately electron-donating but less so than **O** or **OH**. Its effect is somewhat similar to **CH3** but may slightly increase the value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

4. **Comparison with Similar Structures**:
   - The molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** has:
     - A **P(=S)** core (like the high-value examples above).
     - An aromatic ring with **SC** (thioether) and **CH3** substituents (moderate electron-donating effects).
     - No halogens, which would otherwise significantly increase the value.
   - The closest analog in the given examples is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** (value = 2.90523321), but our molecule replaces the **Cl** atoms with **SC** and **CH3**, which are less electron-withdrawing.

### Prediction:
- The **P(=S)** group will contribute a high baseline value (~2.5–3.0).
- The **SC** and **CH3** substituents are less electron-withdrawing than **Cl**, so the value will be lower than the **Cl**-substituted examples but still positive.
- The absence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) reduces the value compared to the highest examples.

Given these factors, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: ~2.2**

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at the examples:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: 2.90523321 (three Cl atoms)
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl**: 3.68536671 (two Cl + one Br)
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl**: 4.94800786 (two Cl + one I)

Our molecule replaces the halogens with **SC** and **CH3**, which are less electron-withdrawing. The **SC** group is somewhat polar but not as strongly electron-withdrawing as halogens. Thus, the value should be lower than the **Cl**-substituted case (2.905) but still positive and significant.

**Final predicted property value: 2.4**  
*(This is a conservative estimate, accounting for the P(=S) contribution and the moderate electron-donating effects of SC and CH3.)*

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 1.2484575919628509
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds** tend to have **higher property values**, especially when the chlorination is symmetric or dense. For example:
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**: 1.98130926  
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: 1.98130926  
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: 2.94292335  
   - **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl**: 12.18411511 (extreme case, fully chlorinated aliphatic).

2. The molecule in question (**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**) is a **polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure** with **6 chlorine atoms**, similar to the third example above (which has 7 chlorines and a value of 2.94292335). 

3. The property value increases with:
   - More chlorines.
   - Symmetrical substitution (e.g., biphenyl systems with chlorines on both rings).

### Prediction:
The given molecule has **6 chlorines** and a **biphenyl core**, but it is slightly less chlorinated than the third example (which has 7 chlorines and a value of 2.94292335). However, it is more chlorinated than the first two examples (which have 4 and 6 chlorines, respectively, and values of 1.98130926).  

Given this, the property value should lie **between 1.98130926 and 2.94292335**. A reasonable estimate is closer to **2.5**, but since the examples with 6 chlorines (symmetrical) are at ~1.98, and the 7-chlorine case is at ~2.94, this molecule (6 chlorines, slightly less symmetrical) would likely be **~2.2**.

However, the exact value is hard to pin down without more examples, but based on the trend, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 2.2**  

*(Note: If forced to match the closest example, it would be ~1.98130926, but the additional chlorine and biphenyl structure suggest a slightly higher value.)*  

### Final Answer:
**2.2** (approximate, based on trend).  

*(If the exact value from similar examples is preferred, it would be **1.98130926**, but the structure suggests a slightly higher value.)*  

---

**Update**: After rechecking, the closest structural match is **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (6 chlorines, value = 1.98130926). The given molecule has one less chlorine on the second ring, but the core structure is similar. Thus, the most defensible prediction is:  

**Predicted property value: 1.98130926**.  

*(This aligns perfectly with the examples.)*  

### Correct Final Answer:  
**1.98130926**.

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.384253091872139
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aliphatic Chains (e.g., CCC, CCCC, etc.)**:
   - Simple alkanes like **CCC** (propane) and **C1CCCCC1** (cyclohexane) have a property value of **1.50328858**.
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCCC**) retain this value unless functional groups are present.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Nitro Groups (NO2)**: The presence of a nitro group tends to decrease the property value. For example:
     - **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (dinitrile with aromatic ring) has a value of **-0.61723085**.
     - **N(=O)=O** groups in other molecules (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O**) lead to negative values (e.g., **-0.86713258**).
   - **Nitroso Groups (N=O)**: The molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** contains a nitroso group (N=O), which is similar to a nitro group but less electron-withdrawing. 

3. **Hybrid Cases**:
   - **CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**: This has two nitro groups and a tertiary amine, yielding **-0.82190915**.
   - **CCCN(=O)=O** has only one nitroso group and a short aliphatic chain, so its value should be less negative than molecules with multiple nitro groups.

4. **Other Trends**:
   - The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, F) or aromatic rings can further modulate the value, but **CCCN(=O)=O** lacks these.

### Prediction for CCCN(=O)=O:
- The base value for **CCC** (propyl group) is **1.50328858**.
- Adding a nitroso group (**N(=O)=O**) will significantly reduce this value, similar to how nitro groups do. However, nitroso is less electron-withdrawing than nitro, so the reduction should be less drastic.
- From examples, a single nitro group reduces the value to around **-0.4 to -0.6** (e.g., **-0.40464386** for **OCC(NC(=O)C(Cl)Cl)C(O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**).
- Since nitroso is less impactful, the value for **CCCN(=O)=O** should be slightly higher (less negative) than these.

### Final Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **CCCN(=O)=O** is approximately **-0.3**. 

However, looking closely at similar molecules:
- **Nc1ccccc1O** (aniline with hydroxyl) has **-0.23763153**.
- **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (dinitrile) has **-0.61723085**.

Since **CCCN(=O)=O** has a nitroso group (less polar than a nitro group) and no aromatic stabilization, a reasonable estimate is between these two values. 

Thus, the predicted value is:  
**-0.35** (approximate). 

For specificity, based on the closest analogies, I predict:  
**-0.30**. 

However, given the examples, a more precise estimate would align with the nitroso group's effect, likely closer to **-0.25 to -0.40**. 

**Final answer: -0.30**. 

(Note: Without a clear mathematical model, this is an approximate prediction based on qualitative trends in the data.)

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.7409440640273717
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations:
1. **Halogen Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br, F) tend to have higher property values, especially when multiple halogens are present. For example:
     - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: 1.479 (1 Cl, 1 Br)
     - **BrC(Br)Br**: 8.930 (3 Br, very high)
     - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)...**: 2.651 (4 Cl)
   - The presence of Br generally increases the property more than Cl or F.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Halogens**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: 1.479 (1 Cl, 1 Br on benzene)
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: 0.690 (multiple Cl on biphenyl)
   - **COc1cccc(Cl)c1**: 0.264 (1 Cl, 1 OCH3 on benzene)
   - **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is analogous to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** but with F instead of Cl.

3. **Electronegativity and Position**:
   - F is more electronegative than Cl but less bulky. Br is larger and less electronegative than Cl but contributes more to the property value.
   - In **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, F and Br are likely para to each other (similar to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** where Cl and Br are para).

4. **Comparison to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: 1.479
   - Replacing Cl with F (smaller, more electronegative) might slightly reduce the property compared to Cl, but Br's presence keeps it high.

### Prediction:
Given that **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is structurally similar to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (but with F instead of Cl), and considering that F is less bulky and more electronegative than Cl, the property value is likely slightly lower than 1.479 but still significant due to the Br. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1: ~1.3**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend that halogens increase the value, with Br > Cl > F in contribution magnitude.) 

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at other examples:
- **COc1cccc(Cl)c1**: 0.264 (Cl + OCH3)
- **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: 1.479 (Cl + Br)
- **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** should be between these, closer to 1.479 because Br dominates. 

Final prediction: **~1.35** (slightly lower than Cl/Br due to F). 

However, since the Cl/Br example is 1.479 and F is less impactful than Cl, a more precise estimate is **1.35**. 

But in the given data, values like 1.479 (Cl/Br) and 0.264 (Cl/OCH3) suggest that Br adds ~1.2 over OCH3, and F is likely between Cl and OCH3. Thus, **F/Br might be ~1.2**. 

Given the uncertainty, the closest reasonable answer is:  
**Predicted value: 1.25**  

(But to match the precision of the given data, I'll round to 2 decimal places like most examples.)  

Final answer: **1.30**  

However, reviewing the examples again, **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** is 1.479, and **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** would likely be slightly less, so:  

**Predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1: 1.40**  

(Compromising between trends, as Br's effect is strong and F's is weaker than Cl.)  

After reconsidering, the most consistent estimate is:  
**1.35**  

But to align with the given data's precision, I'll select **1.40** as the final prediction.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 1.4075708577080217
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular structure.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains with Halogens (e.g., CBr, CCCCBr)**:
   - Simple alkyl halides like CBr and CCCCBr have a property value of **2.98096824**, suggesting halogens (Br) contribute to higher values.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups (e.g., alcohols, ethers, esters)**:
   - Molecules with **-OH (alcohol)** or **-O- (ether)** groups often have a value of **1.40757086** (e.g., CCCC(C)(C)O, CC(C)(C)CO, CCCOCCC, CC1CCCO1).
   - Esters (e.g., CCOC(=O)C) have a lower value (**0.48479633**).

3. **Complex or Aromatic Systems**:
   - Aromatic or heterocyclic systems with multiple functional groups tend to have negative values (e.g., -0.7 to -0.1 range).
   - Steroids or polycyclic systems (e.g., CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO) have values around **-0.4**.

4. **Chlorinated Aromatics**:
   - Highly chlorinated aromatics (e.g., Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl) have high positive values (**1.98130926** or **2.94292335**).

5. **Molecules with Similar Structure to the Target**:
   - The molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(C)(C)O** (similar to the target but with an extra C(C)(C)O group) has a value of **1.40757086**.
   - The molecule **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** (a steroid-like structure with -OH and C=O) has a value of **-0.37812126**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**
- This is a **bicyclic hydrocarbon with a tertiary alcohol (-OH)**.
- It lacks halogens, aromatic rings, or highly polar groups (e.g., C=O, S=O).
- The closest analogs in the examples are simple alcohols (e.g., CCCC(C)(C)O, CC(C)(C)CO) with a value of **1.40757086**.
- The bicyclic structure may slightly reduce the value compared to simpler alcohols, but not as much as aromatic or polyfunctional systems.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the presence of a tertiary alcohol and a bicyclic hydrocarbon framework, the property value is likely close to **1.40757086** (similar to other tertiary alcohols in the examples). 

#### Final Answer:
**1.40757086**

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.14410619459541996
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: 
   - The molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** has a property value of **0.64036336**. This molecule shares the **P(=S)** group with our target molecule, though it has an additional **SC(CCl)** substituent.
   - The **P(=S)** group appears to contribute to a positive property value (likely due to its polarizable and electron-rich nature).

2. **Lactam Ring (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**:
   - The presence of a **lactam ring** (cyclic amide) fused to a benzene ring is seen in both the example and the target molecule. This structural motif does not drastically lower the property value (as seen in the example where it is paired with **P(=S)**).

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - The target molecule is very similar to **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O**, except it lacks the **SC(CCl)** group. The **SC(CCl)** group likely adds some steric and electronic effects, but the core **P(=S)** and **lactam** features dominate the property value.
   - Without the **SC(CCl)** group, the property value might be slightly lower but still in the same positive range.

4. **Other Substituents**:
   - The **OCC** (ethoxy) groups attached to phosphorus are neutral in terms of extreme contributions (they are not strongly electron-withdrawing or donating in this context).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong similarity to the example with a property value of **0.64036336**, and considering the absence of the **SC(CCl)** group (which might slightly reduce the value), a reasonable prediction for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is:

**Predicted property value: 0.55**  

This is slightly lower than the example due to the lack of the **SC(CCl)** group but still positive due to the dominant **P(=S)** and **lactam** contributions.

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -0.6034916031337647
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like** or **quinoxaline-like** core with a **carbonyl group (C=O)** and **two nitrogen atoms** in a fused ring system. This is similar to aromatic heterocycles with polar groups, which often correlate with negative property values in the dataset.
   - Example: **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property = -0.82959549) has a similar fused aromatic system with a carbonyl and nitrogen atoms, yielding a negative value.
   - Example: **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = -0.39150679) also has a diketopiperazine-like core with negative values.

2. **Substituents**: The molecule has **methyl groups (C)** and a **fused benzene ring (c2ccccc2)**, which add slight hydrophobicity but are outweighed by the polar C=O and N groups.
   - Example: **CNc1ccccc1** (property = -0.06008285) shows that even simple aromatic amines with small alkyl groups have slightly negative values.

3. **Polarity**: The **C=O and N atoms** dominate, suggesting a moderate negative value (similar to other polar heterocycles in the dataset).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O**: Property = -0.82959549 (very similar fused polar heterocycle).
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC**: Property = -0.39150679 (less aromatic but similar polar core).
- **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32**: Property = -0.59882538 (fused aromatic N-heterocycle).

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property = -0.82959549), but with slightly less conjugation and a simpler substituent pattern, the property should be slightly less negative. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.75** (approximate, likely between -0.7 and -0.8). 

For specificity, we can refine this to **-0.75843005** (matching the value of another similar diketopiperazine-like structure in the dataset). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.75843005**

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.484796331322129
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - **CCC(=C)C** (branched alkene): 0.94068764  
   - **CCCCC** (linear alkane): 1.50328858  
   - **CCCCCCCI** (linear alkyl iodide): 4.05772219  
   - Hydrocarbon chains with no polar groups tend to have positive values, increasing slightly with length or branching.

2. **Esters (RCOOR')**: 
   - **CCOC(=O)N**: 0.21415309  
   - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**: 0.48479633  
   - **CC(C)OC(=O)C**: 0.48479633  
   - Esters typically have values in the range of ~0.2 to ~0.5.

3. **Polar Functional Groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -Br)**:
   - **OCC(O)C(O)CO** (polyol): 1.14102659  
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (chlorinated aromatic): 1.98130926  
   - **BrC(Cl)Cl** (halogenated methane): 5.92586927  
   - Highly polar or halogenated groups increase the property value significantly.

4. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - **Cc1c2ccccc2cc3ccccc13** (polyaromatic): -0.62617817  
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)cnc3ccccc23** (heteroaromatic): -0.65620602  
   - Aromatic systems tend to have negative values, especially with heteroatoms.

### Analysis of **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is a linear ester: **hexanoic acid ethyl ester** (ethyl hexanoate).  
- It has a 6-carbon chain with an ester group (**-COO-**).  
- Comparing to similar esters in the examples:
  - **CCOC(=O)N**: 0.21415309 (smaller ester)  
  - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**: 0.48479633 (longer chain ester)  
  - **CC(C)OC(=O)C**: 0.48479633 (branched ester)  
- The property value for esters seems to increase slightly with chain length but remains in the ~0.2–0.5 range.  
- Since **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is intermediate in size between the above examples, a reasonable estimate would be close to **0.4**.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.48479633** (matching the trend for similar esters in the dataset).  

This aligns with the observed values for other esters of comparable structure.

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.33642650190913415
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can analyze the given molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** and predict its property value by comparing it to structurally similar molecules in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - The molecule contains a **methyl ester** group (**COC(=O)**) attached to a **benzene ring** (**c1ccccc1**).
   - This is very similar to the following molecules in the dataset:
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (property = **-0.3364265**)
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC** (property = **-0.63495941**)
     - **COC(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)Nc2cccc(C)c2)c1** (property = **-0.94554839**)
   - The presence of the ester group and aromatic ring tends to correlate with negative property values in the dataset.

2. **Comparison to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**:
   - The only difference between **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** and **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is the replacement of an ethyl group (**CCO**) with a methyl group (**CO**).
   - The ethyl ester has a property value of **-0.3364265**.
   - Since the methyl group is slightly smaller and less hydrophobic than the ethyl group, the property value might be slightly more negative (but not drastically different).

3. **Other Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (property = **-0.46676087**) has an additional hydroxyl group, making it more polar and thus more negative.
   - **COC(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)Nc2cccc(C)c2)c1** (property = **-0.94554839**) has additional polar amide groups, further lowering the value.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (property = **-0.3364265**), and considering that the methyl ester is slightly less hydrophobic than the ethyl ester, the property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** should be **slightly more negative**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value = -0.35 to -0.40**.

Looking at the closest match (**CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** at **-0.3364265**), I would predict:  
**-0.34 to -0.36**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is approximately **-0.34**.  

(Note: This aligns closely with the value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, as the difference between methyl and ethyl esters is minor in this context.)

Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.4997054635791074
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **Hydrocarbons with double bonds (alkenes)** tend to have positive property values, but lower than saturated hydrocarbons:
   - `CC/C=C/C` (butene-like): 0.94068764
   - `C=Cc1ccccc1` (styrene-like): -0.11688175 (aromatic conjugation lowers value)
   - Saturated hydrocarbons like `CCC(C)(C)CC` or `C1CCCC1` have higher values (~1.503).

2. **Conjugated double bonds** (like in `C=CCC=C`) typically show intermediate values between single double bonds and aromatic systems. The molecule `C=CCC=C` (1,3-butadiene) is a simple conjugated diene.

3. Comparing to similar structures:
   - `CC/C=C/C` (isolated double bond): 0.94068764
   - `C=Cc1ccccc1` (conjugated with aromatic): -0.11688175
   - `CCC(=O)C` (carbonyl, but somewhat similar length): 0.81120822

Given that conjugation slightly reduces the property value compared to isolated double bonds but not as much as full aromaticity, a reasonable estimate for `C=CCC=C` would be **~0.7**. 

However, looking more closely at the examples, the drop from isolated double bond (`CC/C=C/C`: 0.94) to conjugated aromatic (`C=Cc1ccccc1`: -0.12) is ~1.06, and `C=CCC=C` is only partially conjugated (less than aromatic). Splitting the difference suggests a value around **0.5-0.6**. 

A precise prediction based on the trend is:  
**Predicted property value for `C=CCC=C`: 0.65**  

(Note: This is an educated estimate based on the given examples, assuming the property correlates with conjugation and saturation trends.)
==================================================
Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 8.929683163824118
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends related to halogenated compounds, particularly those with multiple heavy halogens (Br, Cl, etc.).

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds with Multiple Heavy Halogens**:
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br**: This molecule has three fluorines, one chlorine, and one bromine, with a property value of **3.2985052**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: This is hexachlorobenzene with a value of **2.94292335**.
   - **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: This molecule has three chlorines and a value of **5.41862607** (though this is unusually high, possibly due to the phosphate group contributing significantly).
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl**: This is a heavily chlorinated biphenyl-like structure with a value of **1.24845759**.

2. **Brominated Compounds**:
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1**: This is bromonaphthalene with a value of **0.10795641** (only one bromine).
   - **Ic1cccc2ccccc12**: This is iodobenzene with a value of **0.42653706** (iodine is heavier than bromine but only one iodine).

3. **General Trend**:
   - Multiple heavy halogens (Br, Cl) increase the property value significantly compared to single halogens.
   - Bromine contributes more than chlorine (compare FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br = 3.298 vs. heavily chlorinated compounds ~1.2-2.9).
   - The property seems to scale with the number and size of halogens.

### Prediction for BrC(Br)Br (Tribromomethane):
- This molecule has **three bromines**, which are heavy halogens. 
- Comparing to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (3.2985052), which has three fluorines and one bromine/chlorine, we expect **BrC(Br)Br** to have a higher value because bromine is heavier and more polarizable than fluorine or chlorine.
- The heavily chlorinated compounds have values in the 1.2-2.9 range, but bromine is even heavier, so we expect a higher value.
- The presence of three bromines suggests a significant increase, likely in the range of **3.5 to 4.5**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate for **BrC(Br)Br** is **3.8**. 

However, looking more closely at **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (3.298) and considering that three bromines would likely increase this further, a more precise estimate might be closer to **3.5**. 

But since **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (three chlorines + phosphate) is 5.418, and **BrC(Br)Br** has three bromines (heavier than chlorine), a value slightly higher than 3.298 (from FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br) seems plausible. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **BrC(Br)Br** is:  
**3.5** (approximate, likely between 3.3 and 4.0 based on the given data). 

However, given that **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** is 3.298 and **BrC(Br)Br** has three bromines (even heavier), a value slightly higher than 3.298 is reasonable. A precise interpolation suggests **3.6**. 

### Final Answer:
**3.6** (approximate prediction based on halogen trends in the given data).

Iteration: 39
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.6403633565382442
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group contributions. Let's analyze the given molecule step-by-step:

**Molecule:**  
`CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`

### Key structural features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P=S)**: Present in `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property = **1.27055426**). This group tends to increase the property value (positive contribution).
2. **Aromatic ring (c1ccccc1)**: Present in many examples, typically contributes negatively (e.g., `c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2` = **-0.51790228**).
3. **Chlorine (Cl)**: Halogens like Cl often increase the property (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` = **2.61609206**).
4. **Amide/Carbonyl groups (N2C(=O)...C2=O)**: These polar groups can reduce the property (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccccc1` = **-0.46676087**).
5. **Ethoxy groups (CCOP, OCC)**: Ether/alkoxy groups have mixed effects but are often neutral to slightly positive.

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` has P=S, Cl, and aromatic ring → **1.27055426**.
- `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has multiple Cl → **2.61609206**.
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccccc1` has amide + aromatic → **-0.46676087**.

This molecule combines:
- A **P=S group** (strong positive contribution).
- **Chlorine** (positive contribution).
- **Aromatic ring + amides** (negative contributions).
- **Ethoxy groups** (neutral/slightly positive).

The P=S and Cl likely dominate, but the aromatic/amide parts offset some of the positive effect. The closest analog is `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property = **1.27055426**), but this molecule has an additional aromatic/amide group, which may reduce the value slightly.

### Predicted property:
Given the balance of features, the predicted value is likely slightly lower than **1.27055426** but still positive. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.95** (range: 0.9–1.1).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data.)

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.7918034928948909
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular properties like polarity, hydrogen bonding, halogen presence, and aromaticity. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Amide group (C(=O)N)**: Present in examples like `CN(C)C(=O)C` (property = 0.48479633) and `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (property = 0.21415309). This suggests a moderate positive contribution.
2. **Aromatic ring with chlorine substitution**: Seen in `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = -0.16183538) and `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` (property = -0.06008285). Chlorine substitution tends to slightly decrease the property.
3. **Heterocyclic group (n2nc(oc2=O))**: Similar to nitrogen-containing heterocycles like `Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2` (property = -0.57971713), which reduce the property.
4. **Bulky tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)**: Bulky aliphatic groups (e.g., `CCC(C)C`) increase the property (1.50328858), but here it's attached to a polar heterocycle, which may offset this effect.
5. **Polarity and hydrogen bonding**: The amide and heterocycle introduce polarity, but the chlorine and bulky groups may reduce overall polarity.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog is `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (property = 0.21415309), but the given molecule has additional polar (Cl, heterocycle) and bulky features.
- The presence of chlorine and a complex heterocycle likely pulls the property toward negative values, as seen in other Cl/N-containing examples.

### Predicted Property:
Balancing these effects, the property is likely slightly negative but not as extreme as highly polar or halogen-rich examples. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property: -0.35**  

This aligns with the trend where amides with aromatic Cl and heterocycles yield modestly negative values (e.g., -0.161 to -0.579 in similar cases).

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: -0.16183537900079706
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Halogens (Cl, Br, I)**:
   - Molecules with multiple halogens (especially Cl or Br) tend to have higher property values. For example:
     - `ICI` (9.11935544) and `BrC(Br)Br` (8.92968316) have very high values due to halogens.
     - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (1.98130926) has multiple Cl atoms and a high value.
     - `ClC(Cl)(Cl)C#N` (2.54712966) also has multiple Cl atoms and a moderately high value.
   - Single Cl atoms often contribute to positive but lower values (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` has 0.68994708).

2. **Oxygen (O) and Hydroxyl (OH) Groups**:
   - Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., OH, OCH3) tend to reduce the property value or make it more negative. For example:
     - `OCC(O)C(O)CO` (1.14102659) has multiple OH groups but still a positive value (likely due to lack of halogens).
     - `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` (-0.6644299) has multiple OH groups and a negative value.

3. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Aromatic rings with halogens or electron-withdrawing groups tend to have higher values, while those with donating groups (e.g., OH, NH2) tend to have lower or negative values.

4. **Symmetry and Multiple Substitutions**:
   - Molecules with symmetric substitutions (e.g., multiple Cl or OH groups) show additive effects. For example, `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has a high value due to four Cl atoms.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**:
- It has two aromatic rings connected by an oxygen bridge (`Oc1...Oc2`).
- Each ring has Cl substitutions:
  - First ring: one Cl at position 3 (`cc(Cl)ccc`).
  - Second ring: two Cl atoms at positions 2 and 5 (`ccc(Cl)cc2Cl`).
- There are also two hydroxyl groups (`Oc1` and `Oc2`).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
1. `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (one ring, two Cl atoms, one OH group): 0.68994708.
2. `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (one ring, four Cl atoms, one OH group): 1.98130926.
3. `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` (two rings, two Cl atoms, no OH): -0.06008285.

The target molecule has:
- Two rings (like `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2`), but with OH groups and more Cl atoms.
- Total of three Cl atoms (one on the first ring, two on the second).
- Two OH groups (which tend to reduce the property value).

### Estimating the Property:
- The presence of three Cl atoms would push the value higher (similar to `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` but with fewer Cl atoms).
- The two OH groups would reduce the value somewhat.
- The symmetric structure may also play a role.

Given that `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (two Cl, one OH) is 0.68994708, and `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (four Cl, one OH) is 1.98130926, the target molecule (three Cl, two OH) would likely be between these values but closer to the lower end due to the additional OH group.

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate is **~1.2**. 

However, looking more closely:
- The additional OH group (compared to `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`) might reduce the value by ~0.5-0.7.
- The reduction in Cl atoms (from 4 to 3) might reduce the value by ~0.5.
Thus, starting from 1.98130926, subtracting ~0.7 gives ~1.28.

But the two OH groups might have a stronger reducing effect, so a more conservative estimate is **~0.9 to 1.1**.

Given the examples, the closest match is likely slightly higher than `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (0.68994708) but not as high as `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (1.98130926). 

### Final Prediction:
**1.05** (rounded to two decimal places). 

However, considering the exact examples, a more precise estimate might be **1.10**. 

Given the lack of exact matches, I would predict:  
**1.10** (with uncertainty in the range 0.9-1.3). 

But to match the precision of the given examples, I'll provide:  
**1.09874321** (a plausible interpolated value). 

However, since the examples are likely logP or similar, and the trend suggests additive contributions, a more accurate estimate is:  
- Base: `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` = 0.68994708  
- Add one more Cl (similar to `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` trend): +0.3  
- Add one more OH (reducing effect): -0.2  
Total: ~0.79  

But this seems low. Alternatively, treating the two rings as additive:  
- First ring (Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1): similar to `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` but with Cl at meta: ~0.6  
- Second ring (Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl): similar to `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl`: ~0.7  
Combined with OH bridge: ~0.6 + 0.7 - 0.2 (for symmetry) = 1.1  

Thus, the most consistent prediction is:  
**1.10** (or 1.09874321 for precision). 

Given the examples, the closest match is likely:  
**1.09874321**. 

But to simplify, I'll round to:  
**1.10**. 

However, looking back at `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (four Cl, one OH) = 1.98130926, and `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (two Cl, one OH) = 0.68994708, the target (three Cl, two OH) is likely closer to the average of these, adjusted for the extra OH:  
(1.98130926 + 0.68994708)/2 = ~1.33, then subtract ~0.2 for the extra OH: ~1.13. 

Thus, the final predicted value is:  
**1.13**. 

### Final Answer:
**1.13** (approximate interpolated value based on similar examples).

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.9406876400070361
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, size, and halogenation. The molecule `CC/C=C\C` is but-2-ene, an alkene with a trans configuration (as indicated by the `\` and `/` bonds). 

From the examples:
- `CC/C=C/C` (but-2-ene, cis configuration) has a property value of **0.94068764**.
- `CCCC(=O)OC` (an ester) has a value of **0.48479633**.
- `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` (a long alkane) has a value of **1.50328858**.

Alkenes like `CC/C=C/C` have higher values than simple alkanes or polar molecules, likely due to their unsaturation (double bond). The trans configuration (`CC/C=C\C`) is typically less polar and more stable than the cis configuration, but the difference in property value may not be drastic. 

Given that the cis form (`CC/C=C/C`) has a value of **0.94068764**, the trans form (`CC/C=C\C`) might have a slightly lower value due to reduced polarity/steric effects. 

**Predicted property value for `CC/C=C\C`: ~0.90** (slightly lower than the cis form's 0.94068764, but still in the same range for alkenes). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)

Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 1.4075708577080217
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules. Here are some key observations:

1. **Ethers (R-O-R')**: 
   - `CCOC(=O)C` has a value of **0.48479633**.
   - `CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2` has a value of **-0.88986234** (but this is more complex due to additional functional groups).
   - The simpler ether `CCCOCC` is likely to have a value similar to other simple ethers or aliphatic chains.

2. **Aliphatic Chains**:
   - `CC(C)O` (isopropanol) has a value of **1.40757086**.
   - `CCC(O)CC` (pentanol-like) has the same value of **1.40757086**.
   - `CCCCCCC=C` (heptene) has a value of **0.94068764**.
   - `C1CCCCCC1` (cyclohexane) has a value of **1.50328858**.

3. **Oxygen-containing non-ether/alcohol**:
   - `CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` has a value of **-0.43019101**, but this is a very complex structure.

### Prediction for `CCCOCC` (diethyl ether):
This is a simple symmetrical ether with no additional functional groups. Comparing it to similar aliphatic or oxygen-containing molecules:
- It is structurally similar to `CC(C)O` and `CCC(O)CC`, which both have a value of **1.40757086**.
- Ethers like `CCOC(=O)C` have slightly lower values (0.48479633), but this includes a carbonyl group, which likely reduces the value.
- Since `CCCOCC` is a simple ether without polar or complex substituents, it is reasonable to assign it the same value as simple aliphatic alcohols like `CC(C)O` and `CCC(O)CC`.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for `CCCOCC` is **1.40757086**.

Iteration: 44
SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.7946703568636214
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary amide** group (`N(C=O)`), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (as an acceptor).
   - It has two **phenyl rings** (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`), which are hydrophobic and contribute to aromatic stacking interactions.
   - The **tert-butyl-like group** (`C(C)(C)`) attached to the amide nitrogen adds steric bulk and hydrophobicity.

2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property: -0.49570417): This is a simple hydrophobic molecule with two phenyl rings. The presence of two phenyl rings alone gives a moderately negative property value.
   - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property: -0.8244953): This has a tertiary amide linked to a phenyl ring and a heterocyclic system. The additional polar heterocycle likely makes it more negative than our target molecule.
   - **Nc1cccc2ccccc12** (property: -0.46080774): This is a naphthalene derivative with an amino group, which is somewhat comparable to our molecule's phenyl rings but less bulky.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The **tertiary amide** in our molecule is similar to the one in **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3**, but our molecule lacks the highly polar heterocycle (which contributes to the more negative value of -0.824). Thus, our molecule should be less negative.
   - The **two phenyl rings** are similar to **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (-0.495), but our molecule has additional polar character from the amide, which would likely make the property more negative.
   - The **tert-butyl-like group** adds hydrophobicity, which may offset some of the polarity from the amide.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the polar amide and the hydrophobic phenyl/tert-butyl groups, the property value should be slightly more negative than **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (-0.495) but less negative than **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (-0.824). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.55** (interpolated between -0.495 and -0.62, considering the amide's effect).

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at other molecules with amides and phenyl rings:
- **CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1** (property: -0.46676087): This has a secondary amide and a phenyl ring, less bulky than our molecule.
- **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (property: -0.39150679): A polar heterocyclic amide, but smaller.

Our molecule is bulkier and has more hydrophobic character, so the value should be more negative than -0.466 but not as extreme as -0.824. 

**Final Prediction: -0.58** (closer to -0.6, accounting for the bulky hydrophobic groups offsetting the amide polarity).

### Note:
This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the given data. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or computational tools would be necessary. However, based on the examples, **-0.58** is a plausible estimate.

Iteration: 45
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.09670001547556938
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Bromine (Br)**:
   - Molecules with Br substituents tend to have moderate to high positive property values. For example:
     - `c1ccccc1n2ncc(N)c(Br)c2(=O)`: -0.528 (but here Br is part of a complex heterocycle)
     - `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`: 0.740
     - `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1`: 0.529
   - Br often increases the property value unless other strongly negative features dominate.

2. **Amide Group (N-C=O)**:
   - Amides (e.g., `CC(=O)N...`) often reduce the property value. For example:
     - `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`: -0.794
     - `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3`: -0.963
   - The amide group is polar and can introduce negative contributions.

3. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) with neutral substituents have values around 0.1–0.5. With polar groups (e.g., OH, NH2), they tend to be negative:
     - `Cc1ccc(O)cc1C`: -0.060
     - `Cc1ccc(N)cc1`: -0.060

4. **Combined Effects**:
   - The molecule `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` has:
     - An amide group (negative contribution).
     - A Br substituent (positive contribution).
     - An aromatic ring (neutral to slightly negative if polar groups are present).
   - The Br and amide effects may partially cancel each other, but the amide's negative contribution is likely stronger.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1`: 0.529 (Br + OH, net positive).
- `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`: -0.794 (amide dominates).
- `Cc1ccc(N)cc1`: -0.060 (NH2 reduces value slightly).

Given that the amide group is more strongly negative than Br is positive, the net property value should be slightly negative.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.25** (estimated based on balancing the Br (+0.5) and amide (-0.7) effects, with some aromatic neutrality). 

However, looking at `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (0.529) and replacing OH with N-C=O (amide), the drop is likely larger than just the difference between OH and NH2. A more precise estimate would place it closer to **-0.40**.

Given the examples, a reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.35** (between -0.06 for NH2 and -0.79 for complex amides). 

But for consistency with the closest analog (`Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` = 0.529, and amides often pull down by ~0.8–1.0), the predicted value is likely:  
**-0.30 to -0.40**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.35** (approximate, based on structural analogies).
==================================================
Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.15405143729074275
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations:
1. **Alkyl-substituted benzene rings**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene) has a property value of **-0.06008285**.
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyl-methylbenzene) has a property value of **0.15405144**.
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyl-methylbenzene) has a property value of **0.15405144**.
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene) has a property value of **-0.11688175**.

   The presence of alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl, isopropyl) on the benzene ring tends to give property values in the range of **-0.1 to 0.2**, with larger alkyl groups slightly increasing the value.

2. **Branched alkyl chains**:
   - Molecules with branched alkyl chains like **CC(C)CO**, **CC(C)CCO**, and **CC(C)CCCO** all have the same property value of **1.40757086**, suggesting that branching alone does not significantly alter the property when the functional group (e.g., -OH) is the same.

3. **Combination of branched alkyl and benzene**:
   - The molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is a branched alkyl (isobutyl) attached to a benzene ring. This is similar to **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** and **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1**, but with a longer branched chain.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** and **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** both have a property value of **0.15405144**,
- Adding a longer branched chain (**CC(C)C-**) might slightly increase the property value due to increased hydrophobicity/sterics, but not drastically.

Thus, the property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is likely close to the values for similar alkyl-substituted benzenes. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.15405144** (same as the other alkyl-substituted benzenes with similar branching). 

### Final Answer:
**0.15405144**
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.17923548440253834
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Polar Substituents**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): -0.46676087
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): -0.69202984
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol): -0.5069072
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (amide + chloro): -0.26932111
   - **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (fluorene, pure hydrocarbon): -0.49570417

   These examples suggest that aromatic rings with polar substituents (especially electron-withdrawing groups like NO₂, CO, or halogens) tend to have negative property values.

2. **Aldehyde Group (O=CH-) Impact**:
   - The aldehyde group (**O=CH-**) is strongly electron-withdrawing, similar to other carbonyl groups (e.g., amides or ketones in the examples). This would likely push the property value toward the negative range.
   - Compare with **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (steroid with ketone): -0.18781405. The aldehyde in **O=Cc1ccccc1** is even more polar due to the lack of alkyl groups.

3. **Simple Aromatic Aldehyde**:
   - Benzaldehyde (**O=Cc1ccccc1**) lacks additional substituents (like NO₂ or OH), so its property value should be less negative than heavily substituted examples (e.g., dinitrobenzene at -0.69202984 or nitrophenol at -0.5069072).
   - It is most similar to **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (-0.46676087), but without the phenol group, it would likely be slightly less negative.

### Predicted Value:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **O=Cc1ccccc1** should be in the range of **-0.3 to -0.4**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.35**  

This aligns with the trend of aromatic carbonyl compounds (electron-withdrawing groups) having moderately negative values, while being less extreme than heavily substituted examples.

Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.8937492251030943
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Nitro Groups (NO2)**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups (e.g., `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2`) tend to have negative property values (around -0.6 to -0.9).
   - The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which likely contributes to lowering the property value.

2. **Heterocyclic Nitrogen-Containing Rings**:
   - Molecules with nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2`, `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2`) also have negative property values (around -0.3 to -0.5).
   - The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms in a ring seems to reduce the property value.

3. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with polar groups like amides (`C(=O)N`), hydroxyl (`OH`), or ethers (`O`) often have negative or moderately positive values, depending on the rest of the structure.

4. **Aliphatic vs. Aromatic**:
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCO`, `CC(C)C`) tend to have positive values (~1.4 to 1.5).
   - Aromatic systems with halogens (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1`) have moderately positive values (~0.5).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is:
```
O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2
```
Breaking it down:
1. It contains **two amide groups (`C(=O)N`)** and a **nitro group (`N(=O)=O`)** attached to an aromatic ring.
2. It has a **fused nitrogen-containing heterocycle** (imidazolidine-like structure with two amides).
3. The nitro group and the amides are strong electron-withdrawing groups, which likely lower the property value.
4. The structure is somewhat similar to `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` (property = -0.608) but with additional polar amide groups.

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing effects of the nitro and amide groups, as well as the nitrogen-rich heterocycle, the property value is expected to be **negative and in the range of -0.6 to -0.8**.

A reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.72** (similar to other nitro- and amide-containing molecules in the examples).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2** is **-0.72**.
==================================================
Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.6843279485023114
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **-0.06008285**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (a diazo compound linking two phenyl rings) has a value of **-0.68432795**.
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to the diazo compound but with a single nitrogen linker instead of a diazo group (N=N). The single nitrogen linker is less electron-withdrawing than the diazo group, so we'd expect the property value to be less negative than **-0.68432795** but more negative than **-0.06008285** (aniline).

2. **Other Aromatic Systems**:
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3c2ccc4c5ccccc5ccc43** (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a value of **-0.92069136**, but this is much larger and more conjugated.
   - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a carbazole-like structure) has a value of **-0.858269**, which is also more negative due to extended conjugation.

3. **Nitrogen Linkers**:
   - The presence of nitrogen linkers between aromatic rings tends to reduce the property value (make it more negative) compared to simple aromatic systems, but not as drastically as highly conjugated or polycyclic systems.

### Prediction:
The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is a diphenylamine derivative. Compared to:
- Aniline (**Nc1ccccc1**): **-0.06008285** (less negative).
- Diazo-linked diphenyl (**N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**): **-0.68432795** (more negative).

The single nitrogen linker in **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is less electron-withdrawing than the diazo group, so the property value should be between these two. A reasonable estimate is slightly more negative than aniline but less negative than the diazo compound. 

Given the examples, a plausible prediction is:
**-0.40 to -0.50**. 

Looking for closer analogs:
- **Nc1ccccc1**: -0.06008285
- **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: -0.68432795
- The structure is also somewhat similar to **N(=O)=O** substituents (which appear in other examples with values around -0.76 to -0.38), but the nitrogen linker here is less polarizing.

A refined estimate is **-0.45**.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**-0.45** (approximate, based on structural analogs). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -0.39150678584177917
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure (cyclopentane, **CCCC1**). It is a cyclic diamide (imide) with a 5-membered ring fused to another 5-membered ring (pyrrolidine-2,5-dione-like structure).
2. **Polarity**: The presence of two highly polar amide groups suggests significant polarity, which typically correlates with negative property values in the given examples (e.g., other amides/imide-like structures have negative values).
3. **Comparable Examples**:
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (cyclic urea/amide, property = **-0.2998452**).
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (cyclic imide with alkyl chains, property = **-0.39150679**).
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1** (simpler cyclic imide, not in examples but likely similar to the above).

### Key Observations:
- Cyclic structures with polar groups (amides, imides) tend to have negative property values in the range of **-0.3 to -0.9**.
- The molecule here is more rigid and symmetric than **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** but lacks long alkyl chains, which might push the value slightly less negative (closer to **-0.3**).

### Prediction:
Given the symmetry and lack of bulky substituents, the property value is likely **between -0.3 and -0.4**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.35** (interpolated from similar cyclic amides/imides in the examples).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2** is **-0.35**.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.2643029840185254
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl (1,4-dichlorobenzene)**: Property value = **1.05863226**
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (a polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure)**: Property value = **1.24845759**
   - **Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene)**: Not explicitly given, but similar to dichlorobenzene, we can infer higher chlorination increases the property value.

2. **Structural Features**:
   - The presence of **multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings** tends to **increase the property value** (e.g., 1.058 for dichlorobenzene, 1.248 for a more chlorinated structure).
   - The molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is a **dichlorinated biphenyl** (two benzene rings linked, with 3 chlorine atoms total). This is more chlorinated than dichlorobenzene but less than the heavily chlorinated example (1.248).

3. **Trend**:
   - More chlorine atoms and larger aromatic systems (e.g., biphenyls) correlate with higher property values.
   - The given molecule has **3 chlorine atoms** and a **biphenyl core**, so its value should be **higher than 1.058 (dichlorobenzene)** but **lower than 1.248 (more chlorinated example)**.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to the examples, the property value for **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is likely close to the middle of the range observed for chlorinated aromatics. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 1.15**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the trend. Without a model or additional data, the exact value cannot be precisely determined, but it should fall between 1.058 and 1.248.)

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.15405143729074275
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, and molecular size. The molecule in question is **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1**, which is **diethylbenzene** (specifically, the 1,4-isomer based on the symmetry).

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons** (e.g., alkanes, alkenes, or simple aromatics without polar groups) tend to have **positive property values**:
   - `CCCCCCc1ccccc1` (hexylbenzene) → **0.15405144**
   - `C=CC=O` (acrolein, slightly polar) → **0.39821592**
   - `CCc1ccccn1` (ethylpyridine) → **0.07450112**
   - `CCCCCCCC=C` (unsaturated hydrocarbon) → **0.94068764**

2. **Polar or functionalized molecules** (e.g., nitro, hydroxyl, carbonyl, or heterocycles) tend to have **negative property values**.

3. **Diethylbenzene (CCc1ccc(CC)cc1)** is a **nonpolar, symmetric hydrocarbon** with no functional groups. It is structurally similar to hexylbenzene (`CCCCCCc1ccccc1`), but with two shorter ethyl groups instead of one long hexyl chain. 

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Hexylbenzene has a value of **0.15405144**,
- Ethylpyridine (slightly more polar due to the N-heteroatom) has a value of **0.07450112**,
- Unsaturated hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCCCCCCC=C`) have higher values (~0.94), but diethylbenzene is fully saturated,

The property value for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** should be **slightly lower than hexylbenzene but still positive**, likely in the range of **0.10 to 0.15**. 

### Final predicted value:
**0.12000000** (a reasonable estimate based on the trend for symmetric, nonpolar aromatics). 

(Note: If the property is logP or a similar hydrophobicity metric, this aligns with diethylbenzene being less hydrophobic than hexylbenzene but still nonpolar.)

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -0.14410619459541996
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **4-aminobenzenesulfonamide** (a sulfa drug derivative), with the structure:
- Aniline ring (N-substituted benzene) with an electron-donating **-NH2** group.
- A strongly electron-withdrawing **sulfonamide group (-S(N)(=O)=O)** para to the -NH2.

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -NO2, halogens)** tend to increase the property value (e.g., ClCBr = 4.25, ClC(=C(Cl)C(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl)Cl = 7.06).
2. **Electron-donating groups (e.g., -NH2, -OH)** tend to decrease the property value (e.g., Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12 = -0.54, Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O = -0.51).
3. **Sulfonamides and nitro groups** are strong electron-withdrawing moieties, but when paired with electron-donating groups (like -NH2), the property value tends to be moderately negative (e.g., Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O = -0.51, Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O = -0.69).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (nitroaniline) has a property value of **-0.5069072**.
- **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12** (purine derivative) has a value of **-0.54450537**.
- The sulfonamide group (-S(N)(=O)=O) is slightly less electron-withdrawing than -NO2 but still significant.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the electron-donating -NH2 and electron-withdrawing -S(N)(=O)=O, the property value should be **similar to nitroaniline but slightly less negative** due to the sulfonamide's slightly weaker electron-withdrawing effect.

### Final Predicted Value:
**-0.45** (approximately between -0.51 and -0.40, considering the sulfonamide's impact). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated estimate based on the trend in the provided data.)

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: -0.7284472911837231
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples. 

### Structural Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings, forming a **tetracene-like structure** (specifically, it is **triphenylene**). 

Key observations:
1. **Aromaticity**: The molecule is fully aromatic, with extensive conjugation across the fused rings.
2. **Planarity**: The structure is rigid and planar, typical of PAHs.
3. **Substituents**: There are no heteroatoms or functional groups; it is purely hydrocarbon.

### Comparison to Examples:
From the given data, similar PAHs include:
- **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12**: Property = **-0.80860866**  
  (This is a methyl-substituted PAH with 4 fused rings, similar in size but slightly less conjugated due to the methyl group.)
- **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54**: Property = **-0.87144136**  
  (This is a larger PAH with 5 fused rings, showing a more negative value.)
- **Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32**: Property = **-0.62617817**  
  (A smaller PAH with 3 fused rings and a methyl group.)

### Trend:
- Larger, more conjugated PAHs tend to have more negative property values.
- The absence of substituents (like halogens or polar groups) reduces the property value compared to halogenated examples (e.g., Cl/Br-substituted aromatics have high positive values).
- The given molecule is intermediate in size between the examples above.

### Prediction:
Given its **fully conjugated, unsubstituted tetracene-like structure**, the property value should be **more negative than -0.62617817 (3-ring PAH)** but **less negative than -0.87144136 (5-ring PAH)**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.75 ± 0.05** (closer to the 4-ring methyl-substituted example but slightly more negative due to full conjugation).

### Final Answer:
**-0.75** (approximate based on structural similarity and trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, polarizability, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: -0.9256401996912804
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and overall molecular complexity. The molecule in question is:

**Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)**: The molecule has several -OH groups, which are highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding. This typically lowers the property value (as seen in other examples with multiple -OH groups, e.g., `Oc1cccc(O)c1` has a value of -0.23763153).
2. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings, which can contribute to a lower property value (aromatic systems in the examples often have negative values).
3. **Carbonyl group (C=O)**: The presence of a ketone (C=O) adds polarity but is less impactful than -OH groups.
4. **Ether linkage (Oc)**: The ether linkage is moderately polar but less so than -OH.
5. **Symmetry and conjugation**: The molecule is conjugated and symmetric, which may stabilize it and further lower the property value.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (two -OH groups): -0.23763153  
- `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl` (complex with -OH and halogens): -0.67648039  
- `OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5` (multiple -OH and aromaticity): -1.01565406  

The molecule here has **four -OH groups**, more than any of the above examples, and significant aromaticity/conjugation. This suggests a **strongly negative property value**, likely more negative than -0.67648039 but not as extreme as -1.01565406 due to the lack of halogens or additional bulky groups.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.85**  

This balances the strong hydrogen-bonding contribution of the -OH groups with the stabilizing effects of aromaticity and conjugation.

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 1.5277837033321604
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-containing compounds** (e.g., with P=O or P=S) tend to have higher property values, especially when combined with halogens (Cl) or sulfur (S):
   - COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl: **2.905**
   - COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl: **1.680**
   - CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C: **2.651**

2. **Sulfur (S)** in the structure often increases the property value, especially when part of a phosphate or thiophosphate group (e.g., P=S or P-S-C).

3. **Amide groups (NC=O)** or **carbonyls (C=O)** tend to reduce the property value when not paired with strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2 or halogens).

4. **Simple alkanes or alcohols** have lower values (e.g., CCCCC: **1.503**, CCC(C)(O)CC: **1.408**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**  
- Contains a **phosphate group (P=O)** and a **thioether (S-C)** linkage, which are associated with higher property values (as seen in similar phosphorus-sulfur compounds).
- Also includes an **amide (NC(C)=O)**, which may slightly reduce the value compared to purely phosphorus-sulfur compounds.
- No halogens (Cl, Br) are present, which would otherwise significantly increase the value.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: **1.680** (higher due to multiple Cl atoms and P=O).
- **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**: **2.651** (higher due to P=S and S-C).
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: **2.905** (highest due to P=S and multiple Cl atoms).

The target molecule has **P=O and S-C** but lacks halogens, so its value should be between the purely phosphorus-sulfur compounds and those with additional electron-withdrawing groups. The amide may slightly lower it.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate is **~1.8 to 2.2**. A precise prediction based on the examples would be:  
**2.1** (rounded to one decimal place for consistency with the given data).

### Final Answer:
**2.1**
==================================================
Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 2.4130211999605997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `Cl\C=C/Cl` (1,2-dichloroethene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Cycloalkanes**: 
   - `CC1CCCC1` (methylcyclopentane) and `CCCC(C)C` (branched alkane) both have a value of **1.50328858**. 
   - This suggests that saturated hydrocarbons (no heteroatoms or unsaturation) tend to have high positive values (~1.5).

2. **Oxygen-Containing Aliphatic Compounds**:
   - `CCCCCCCCO` (octanol) and `CCCCO` (butanol) both have a value of **1.40757086**.
   - The presence of an -OH group reduces the property value slightly compared to pure alkanes.

3. **Carbonyl Compounds**:
   - `CCCC(=O)C` (2-pentanone) has a value of **0.81120822**.
   - The carbonyl group (C=O) further reduces the property value compared to alcohols.

4. **Chlorinated Compounds**:
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a very high value of **1.98130926**, likely due to the high number of Cl atoms and aromaticity.
   - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (dichlorophenol) has a value of **0.68994708**, which is lower than the fully chlorinated aromatic but still positive.
   - `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (chloroaniline) has a value of **0.26430298**, suggesting that the -NH2 group reduces the effect of Cl.

5. **Double Bonds**:
   - `CCCC(=C)C` (unsaturated hydrocarbon) has a value of **0.94068764**, which is lower than the saturated counterpart (`CCCC(C)C` with 1.50328858). This suggests that unsaturation reduces the property value.
   - `CCC=O` (butanal) has a value of **0.81120822**, similar to other carbonyls.

6. **Highly Polar or Complex Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with amides, nitros, or multiple heteroatoms tend to have negative values (e.g., `CCC1(CCC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2` has -0.53928397).

### Analysis of `Cl\C=C/Cl`:
- This is a simple unsaturated chlorinated hydrocarbon (1,2-dichloroethene). 
- It has two Cl atoms and a C=C double bond.
- From the examples:
  - Chlorine atoms tend to increase the property value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)...` has 1.981, but this is an extreme case with many Cl atoms).
  - Double bonds reduce the property value compared to saturated analogs (e.g., `CCCC(=C)C` is 0.94068764 vs. `CCCC(C)C` is 1.50328858).
- The molecule is not as heavily chlorinated as the hexachlorobiphenyl example, nor does it have polar groups like -OH or -NH2 that would significantly reduce the value.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Saturated hydrocarbons: ~1.5
- Unsaturated hydrocarbons: ~0.9 (e.g., `CCCC(=C)C` is 0.94068764)
- Adding Cl atoms tends to increase the value, but not as dramatically as in heavily chlorinated aromatics.

For `Cl\C=C/Cl`, I would expect a value slightly higher than an unsaturated hydrocarbon but not as high as a heavily chlorinated aromatic. A reasonable estimate would be around **1.0 to 1.2**. 

Looking at the examples, the closest analog is `CCCC(=C)C` (0.94068764), but with two Cl atoms, the value should be higher. 

### Final Prediction:
**1.20000000** (approximate, based on trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data. The actual value may differ if the property has nonlinear dependencies.)

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 0.07450112361676621
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aromatic Rings with Heteroatoms**:
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1**: -0.78006366 (contains aromatic ring with N and O)
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2**: -0.76787557 (aromatic with N and O)
   - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23**: -0.68432795 (polycyclic aromatic with multiple N)
   - **COc5cc4OCC3Oc2c1CC(Oc1ccc2C(=O)C3c4cc5OC)C(C)=C**: -0.96317391 (complex aromatic with O)
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2**: -0.60811432 (aromatic with multiple N and O)

2. **Simple Aromatic Hydrocarbons**:
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43**: -0.87144136 (polycyclic aromatic, no heteroatoms)
   - **Cc1cccc2c1Cc3ccccc32**: -0.49570417 (fused aromatic rings, no heteroatoms)
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1Cl)c2ccccc2**: -0.06008285 (aromatic with Cl substituents)
   - **CNc1ccccc1**: -0.06008285 (aromatic with N substituent)

3. **Pyridine-like Structures**:
   - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23**: -0.68432795 (contains a pyridine-like N in one of the rings)
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2**: -0.60811432 (multiple N in aromatic rings)

4. **Simple Pyridine (c1ccncc1)**:
   - This is a 6-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen. It is less complex than many of the examples above but shares similarities with molecules like **CNc1ccccc1** (where N is a substituent, not in the ring) and **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (where N is in the ring).

### Key Trends:
- The presence of nitrogen in an aromatic ring tends to lower the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons (e.g., **CNc1ccccc1** is -0.06008285, while **Cc1cc(C)c2ccccc2c1** is -0.32924667).
- More nitrogen atoms or additional functional groups further decrease the value (e.g., **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** is -0.60811432).
- **Pyridine (c1ccncc1)** is simpler than most of the examples, with only one nitrogen in the ring and no other substituents.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **CNc1ccccc1** (aniline-like, N as substituent) has a value of -0.06008285.
- **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (more complex N-containing aromatic) has -0.68432795.
- **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (multiple N in rings) has -0.60811432.

**Pyridine (c1ccncc1)** is simpler than these but has a nitrogen in the ring, which likely gives it a slightly negative value. A reasonable estimate is between -0.1 and -0.3. 

Given the examples, I predict the property value for **c1ccncc1** to be:  
**-0.15** (a conservative estimate, considering the simplicity of pyridine compared to the more complex examples). 

However, looking at **CNc1ccccc1** (-0.06008285) and noting that pyridine's nitrogen is directly in the ring (which may have a slightly stronger effect), a more precise estimate might be closer to **-0.12**. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **c1ccncc1** is **-0.12**.

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: -0.8859019457260964
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Structural Features of the Molecule:
1. **Polar functional groups**: 
   - Multiple hydroxyl groups (`OCC(O)CO-`), similar to polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (property = 0.979) or `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (property = 1.059).
   - An ester group (`COC(=O)-`), seen in molecules like `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` (property = -0.635).
   - An aromatic amine (`Nc2ccnc3...`), analogous to `Nc1ccccc1` in some examples (e.g., `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1`, property = -0.467).
   - A chloro-substituted aromatic ring (`cc(Cl)ccc`), similar to `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (property = 2.159) or `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (property = 1.981).

2. **Extended conjugated system**: 
   - The molecule has a large conjugated system with multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms (N, O), similar to polyaromatic systems like `c1cc2ccc3cccc4ccc(c1)c2c34` (property = -0.728) or `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54` (property = -0.871).

3. **Mixed contributions**:
   - The polar hydroxyl/ester groups would push the property toward positive values (as seen in polyols).
   - The aromatic/chloro/amine components would push it toward negative or moderate values (as seen in aromatic amines or chloro-aromatics).

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The closest analog is likely **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** (property = -0.795), which has two aromatic amines and a carbonyl. Our molecule has similar features but with additional polar groups (OH, ester) and a chloro substituent.
- Another similar molecule is **CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1OC(C)C** (property = -0.575), which has an ester, aromatic ring, and polar groups.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between:
- The negative contributions from the aromatic amine and chloro-aromatic (similar to examples with values around -0.5 to -0.8).
- The positive contributions from the polyol-like fragment (values ~1.0), though this is offset by the larger conjugated system.

The final prediction is **-0.65**, as this aligns with the trends for complex aromatic systems with polar substituents.

### Final Answer:
**-0.65** (estimated based on structural similarity to given examples).
==================================================
Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 1.4075708577080217
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains with Terminal Functional Groups:**
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): 0.15405144  
   - **CCCCCCCI** (1-iodohexane): 4.05772219  
   - **CCC(C)Cl** (2-chlorobutane): 2.31568671  
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tert-amyl alcohol): 1.40757086  
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cyclooctanol): 1.40757086  

   These examples suggest that longer hydrocarbon chains with polar terminal groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -I) tend to have higher property values, especially when the functional group is highly polar or heavy (e.g., iodine).

2. **Alcohols:**
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tert-amyl alcohol): 1.40757086  
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cyclooctanol): 1.40757086  
   These alcohols have property values around **1.40757086**, indicating that the -OH group contributes significantly to the property.

3. **Chain Length and Branching:**
   - Linear chains with -OH (like **CCCCCO**) are likely to have a similar or slightly lower value than branched alcohols (like **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**) due to reduced steric effects or polarity dispersion.

### Prediction for **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol):
- It is a linear alcohol with a 5-carbon chain and a terminal -OH group.  
- Comparing to **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (branched, 5 carbons, value = 1.40757086), the linear version (**CCCCCO**) might have a slightly lower value due to less steric hindrance and slightly weaker polarization effects.  
- However, the presence of the -OH group still dominates, so the value should be close to **1.4**.  

Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value for CCCCO: ~1.35 to 1.45**.  

A specific prediction based on the closest analogs (linear vs. branched alcohols):  
**1.40757086** (same as **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** and **OC1CCCCCCC1**, as the -OH group's effect is similar).  

Thus, the predicted value is:  
**1.40757086**  

(Note: If the property is logP or a similar measure, this aligns with the trend of alcohols having moderate values, while longer chains or heavier halogens increase it further.)  

Final answer:  
**1.40757086**

To predict the property value for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O))** and a **lactam-like ring (C(=O)N)** fused to a benzene ring. This suggests moderate polarity and potential hydrogen-bonding capability.
2. **Substituents**: 
   - A **methyl group (CC)** is attached to the heterocyclic ring.
   - An **ethylene bridge (CCO)** is part of the ring system, adding some flexibility.
   - The **benzene ring (c2ccccc2)** is substituted with an amide group, contributing to aromaticity and polarity.
3. **Electron-Withdrawing/Delocalizing Groups**: 
   - The **sulfonyl group** is strongly electron-withdrawing.
   - The **amide group (C(=O)N)** also withdraws electrons but can participate in resonance.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Sulfonyl-Containing Molecules**: 
  - `CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C` has a value of **-0.020404**.
  - `CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of **-0.08888134**.
  These are moderately negative due to polar sulfonyl/phosphate groups.
- **Amide-Containing Molecules**: 
  - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1` has a value of **-0.38484537**.
  - `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` has a value of **-0.39150679**.
  These are more negative due to hydrogen-bonding amides.
- **Aromatic Systems**: 
  - `Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2` has a value of **-0.68432795** (highly negative due to amino groups).
  - `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` has a value of **-0.23763153** (less negative due to hydroxyl groups).

### Prediction:
The molecule combines a **sulfonyl group** (moderately negative influence) and an **amide group** (more negative influence) with an **aromatic system**. The absence of strongly electron-donating groups (like -OH or -NH2) and the presence of electron-withdrawing sulfonyl/amide groups suggest a **moderately negative value**, similar to other sulfonamides or polar aromatic systems in the examples.

Given the closest analogs:
- The sulfonyl-amide combination is less negative than pure amides but more negative than sulfonyl-only systems.
- A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.2 and -0.4**.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.35** (specific value chosen based on interpolation between sulfonyl and amide examples). 

This aligns with the structural balance between electron-withdrawing groups and aromaticity in the molecule.

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: -0.964442889353695
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic system with nitro group**: The molecule contains a benzene ring substituted with a nitro group (**N(=O)=O**), which is electron-withdrawing. Similar examples:
   - **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (property: -0.32924667)
   - **Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (property: -0.38484537)
   - **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (property: -0.49570417)
   These suggest that aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups tend to have negative property values.

2. **Ester groups**: The molecule has two ester groups (**C(=O)OC**), which are polar and can influence the property. Examples with esters:
   - **CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC** (property: -0.63495941)
   - **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** (property: 1.18339612)
   The impact of esters seems context-dependent, but the presence of multiple esters here may contribute to a more negative value.

3. **Heterocyclic nitrogen**: The molecule includes a nitrogen in a non-aromatic ring (**NC=**), which can act as a weak electron donor. Examples with nitrogen heterocycles:
   - **c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2** (property: -0.28472613)
   - **Cc1ccncc1C** (property: 0.07450112)
   These suggest modest effects, but combined with the nitro group, the net effect is likely negative.

4. **Substituted aromatic system**: The benzene ring is part of a larger conjugated system, which may delocalize electron density. Examples like **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (property: -0.49570417) show that extended conjugation can lower the property value.

### Comparison to Closest Examples:
- The molecule resembles **Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (property: -0.38484537) but has additional electron-withdrawing esters and a heterocyclic nitrogen. This would likely make the property more negative.
- The presence of two esters and a nitro group is similar to **CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O** (property: -0.82190915), though the latter has more nitro groups.

### Predicted Property:
Given the combined effects of the nitro group, esters, and conjugated system, the property is expected to be **more negative than -0.38484537 but less negative than -0.82190915**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property: -0.65**  

*(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural analogies. For precise predictions, computational tools or QSAR models would be needed.)*

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.39150678584177917
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). It is a cyclic diamide (imide) structure with a fused cyclopropane.
2. **Polarity**: The presence of two highly polar amide groups suggests significant polarity, which may influence the property.
3. **Rigidity**: The cyclopropane ring and the fused imide structure introduce rigidity, which can affect conformational flexibility and intermolecular interactions.
4. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., amides, carbonyls) often have property values in the **negative to near-zero range** (e.g., **-0.37 to -0.79** for similar polar/rigid structures like `ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` or `Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12`).
   - The cyclopropane ring may slightly increase the property value compared to purely aromatic or flexible chains (e.g., `c1ccncc1` has a low value of **0.074**, while rigid fused rings like `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32` have **-0.626**).

### Prediction:
Given the balance between polarity (reducing the property) and rigidity (moderating the reduction), the predicted property value is likely in the **moderately negative range**, similar to other rigid polar molecules in the dataset. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.45** (with an expected range of **-0.4 to -0.6** based on analogous structures).

### Final Answer:
**-0.45** (predicted property value for **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**).

Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 2.315686706919218
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCC** (chloroethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Halogenated Alkanes**:
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): 1.50328858  
   - **CCC(C)(C)CC** (branched alkane): 1.50328858  
   - **CCC1CCCCC1** (cyclohexane with substituent): 1.50328858  
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): 0.5452801  
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene): 2.61609206  
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (iodobenzene with chloro substituent): 2.15941974  

   Simple alkanes tend to have values around **1.5**, while halogenated (especially chlorinated) molecules have higher values, often > **0.5**, increasing with more halogens.

2. **Small Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl** (highly chlorinated): 7.06185358  
   - **ClCC** is a very small chlorinated molecule (chloroethane), so its value should be lower than highly chlorinated examples but higher than simple alkanes.

3. **Trend for Chloro-Substituents**:
   - Adding a single **Cl** to a small alkane (like ethane) likely increases the property value compared to the parent alkane (ethane would be ~1.5, similar to pentane).  
   - From **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene: 0.545), we see that a single **Cl** on an aromatic ring gives ~0.545. For aliphatic systems, the effect might be slightly stronger.

### Prediction for **ClCC**:
- The molecule is **chloroethane (Cl-CH2-CH3)**, a small aliphatic chloroalkane.  
- Compared to **CCCCC** (1.503), a single **Cl** substituent should increase the value but not as much as in highly chlorinated systems.  
- A reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than chlorobenzene (0.545) but less than multi-chlorinated systems.  

Given the examples, a plausible prediction is:  
**Property value for ClCC: ~1.8**  

### Final Answer:
**1.80000000**  

*(This is an educated estimate based on the trend of increasing property values with halogenation, particularly chlorine, in the given examples.)*

SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 2.380271958037997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule consists of:
1. A **chlorinated pyridine ring (Clc1cccc(n1))**: Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle with nitrogen, and it is substituted with a chlorine atom.
2. A **trichloromethyl group (C(Cl)(Cl)Cl)** attached to the pyridine ring.

### Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Systems**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = 0.26430298 (dichlorobiphenyl-like structure)
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2**: Property = -0.30729918 (chlorinated biphenyl)
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: Property = 1.24845759 (trichloromethyl-substituted biphenyl)
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl**: Property = 1.67967259 (hexachlorobenzene with nitro group)

2. **Trichloromethyl Groups**:
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O**: Property = 2.65106083 (trichloromethyl with complex substituents)
   - **CCC(C)(C)Cl**: Property = 2.31568671 (simple chloroalkane)
   - **BrC(Cl)Cl**: Property = 5.92586927 (bromodichloromethane)

3. **Pyridine or Nitrogen-Containing Aromatics**:
   - **c2ccc1ocnc1c2**: Property = -0.3364265 (fused oxazole-pyridine)
   - **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**: Property = -0.41112067 (pyridine with hydrazide)

### Key Trends:
- The presence of **chlorine atoms** generally increases the property value, especially when multiple chlorines are present (e.g., trichloromethyl or polychlorinated aromatics).
- **Pyridine/nitrogen-containing aromatics** tend to have lower or moderate property values unless heavily substituted with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro or trichloromethyl).
- The **trichloromethyl group (CCl3)** significantly increases the property value, as seen in examples like **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)...** (2.651) and **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (1.248).

### Prediction for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl:
- The molecule is a **chloropyridine with a trichloromethyl group**, which combines:
  1. A moderately electron-deficient pyridine ring (lowering effect).
  2. A chlorine substituent on the ring (small increasing effect).
  3. A strongly electron-withdrawing trichloromethyl group (large increasing effect).

Given the examples, the trichloromethyl group's effect dominates, but the pyridine ring moderates it slightly. Comparable structures (e.g., **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** with property 1.248) suggest a value in the **1.0 to 2.0 range**.

### Final Prediction:
**Property value = 1.45**

This is a reasonable estimate based on the combined effects of the trichloromethyl group and the chloropyridine scaffold, interpolating between similar examples.

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: 1.4075708577080217
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (which is 2-hexanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Alcohols (with -OH group)**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (3-heptanol): Property value = **1.40757086**
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (1-phenylethanol): Property value = **0.10795641**
   - **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol): Property value = **1.40757086**
   - **CCC(CC)CO** (3-methyl-1-pentanol): Property value = **1.40757086**

   The property values for linear or branched aliphatic alcohols (without aromatic rings) tend to cluster around **1.40757086**. The presence of an aromatic ring (e.g., **CC(O)c1ccccc1**) reduces the value significantly.

2. **Position of the -OH group**:
   - The property value seems relatively insensitive to the position of the -OH group in aliphatic chains (e.g., 3-heptanol and 2-methyl-1-pentanol both have the same value).

3. **Comparison to Target Molecule**:
   - **CCCCC(C)O** is 2-hexanol, a branched aliphatic alcohol similar to **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol) and **CCC(CC)CO** (3-methyl-1-pentanol), which both have a value of **1.40757086**.

### Prediction:
Since **CCCCC(C)O** is structurally similar to the other aliphatic alcohols in the dataset (same functional group and no aromatic rings), its property value is likely the same as the other aliphatic alcohols: **1.40757086**.

### Final Answer:
**1.40757086**

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 1.9813092649699096
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl): -0.06008285
   - **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O**: -0.89756396
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1**: 0.68994708
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene): Similar to our target but with Cl instead of Br. Its property value is not explicitly given, but we can infer from similar structures.

2. **Effect of Halogens**:
   - Chlorine substitution tends to increase the property value compared to non-halogenated aromatics (e.g., **c1ccccc1SC**: 0.64036336 vs. **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl**: -0.06008285).
   - Bromine is heavier and more polarizable than chlorine, so it may have a stronger effect on the property (likely increasing it further).

3. **Symmetry and Substitution Pattern**:
   - 1,4-disubstituted benzenes (para-substitution) often have higher property values than ortho- or meta-substituted ones due to symmetry and electronic effects.
   - For example, **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (2,5-dichlorophenol) has a value of 0.68994708, which is higher than less symmetric halogenated aromatics.

4. **Bromine vs. Chlorine**:
   - Bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine, so **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** would likely have a higher property value than its chlorine analog (**Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**).
   - From the examples, **ClC(Cl)Cl** (chloroform) has a value of 4.78042244, while **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) has 3.38167798. This suggests that adding more halogens increases the property value, and bromine would further amplify this.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- 1,4-dichlorobenzene (if it were in the examples) would likely have a value around 0.5–1.0 (based on similar structures like **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1**: 0.68994708).
- Replacing Cl with Br would increase the property value further due to bromine's greater polarizability and size.

Thus, the predicted property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is approximately:  
**1.25** (estimated based on trends).  

However, looking more closely at the examples, **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** is not directly listed, but **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (similar but with an OH group) is 0.68994708. Removing the OH and keeping just the Cl would likely reduce the value slightly, but adding Br instead would increase it. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.95** (conservative estimate, likely between 0.8 and 1.2).  

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**0.92** (aligning with the trend of halogenated aromatics in the examples).  

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is **0.92**.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 1.9813092649699096
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the provided examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds** tend to have higher property values. For example:
   - **ClC(Br)Br**: 7.29446531 (simple chlorinated/brominated aliphatic)
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: 8.03284174 (hexachlorinated biphenyl-like structure)
   - The given molecule is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)** with **7 chlorine atoms**, similar to the second example (which has 8 chlorines and a value of 8.03284174).

2. The property seems to **increase with the number of chlorines** and **aromatic rings**. The given molecule has:
   - Two benzene rings.
   - Seven chlorine substituents (slightly fewer than the second example, which has 8 chlorines).

3. The **connectivity and symmetry** also matter. The given molecule is less symmetric than the second example (which has full chlorination on both rings), so its value may be slightly lower.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- The second example (8 chlorines) has a value of **8.03284174**.
- The given molecule has **7 chlorines** and similar biphenyl structure but slightly less chlorination/symmetry.

A reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than 8.03284174. Given the trend, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 7.85** (approximate, likely between 7.8 and 8.0 based on the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, polarizability, etc.—this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the data.)

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: -0.8937492251030943
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains three aromatic rings (two substituted phenyl rings and one central phenyl ring). Aromaticity is common in many of the examples, and its contribution to the property seems context-dependent (e.g., presence of polar substituents matters).
2. **Phosphate group (OP(=O)(...)...)**: This is a polar, charged (or chargeable) group. Molecules with polar/charged groups (e.g., P=O, P=S, COOH, OH, etc.) in the examples tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.69958878 for Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1, which has amide and aromatic groups).
3. **Methyl substituents (C)**: These are non-polar and hydrophobic. Non-polar groups (e.g., alkyl chains) tend to increase the property value (e.g., CCC=C has 0.94068764, CCCC has 1.50328858).
4. **Ether linkages (Oc2cccc(C)c2 and Oc3ccccc3C)**: These are polar but not as strongly as phosphate. Ethers are somewhat intermediate in polarity.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The phosphate group is similar to the phosphorothioate groups in **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property = 0.64036336) and **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC** (property = 7.45321157). However, the latter has multiple sulfur and phosphate groups, making it an outlier. The former is more relevant, with a positive but modest property value.
- The aromatic rings with methyl substituents are similar to **CC(C)c1ccccc1** (property = 0.15405144) or **Cc1ccnc(C)c1** (property = 0.07450112), which have small positive values.
- The combination of polar (phosphate) and non-polar (methyl, aromatic) groups suggests a balance, likely leading to a modest property value.

### Notable Trends:
- Highly non-polar molecules (e.g., CCCCCCCCC) have large positive values (~1.5).
- Molecules with polar/charged groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -C=O, -P=O) tend to have negative or small positive values.
- The phosphate group here is strongly polar, but the methyl groups and aromaticity may offset this somewhat.

### Prediction:
Given the phosphate group's dominance in polarity but the counterbalance from aromaticity and methyl groups, the property value is likely **small and negative**. Comparing to similar molecules (e.g., those with P=O or P=S and aromatic systems), a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45** (approximate, likely between -0.3 and -0.6). 

This aligns with examples like **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (-0.09830238, less polar than phosphate) or **Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1** (-0.69958878, similarly polar but with more aromatic bulk). The exact value is hard to pinpoint without a model, but -0.45 is a plausible interpolation.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -0.020404001354152178
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: Present in the aromatic ring. From the examples, molecules with CF3 (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C`) tend to have negative property values (around -0.6).
2. **Aromatic ring with substitution**: The aromatic ring is substituted with an electron-withdrawing CF3 group and a complex heterocyclic group. Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2, CF3) often correlate with negative property values.
3. **Heterocyclic group with carbonyl (C=O) and chloro substituents**: The presence of C=O and Cl in the heterocycle suggests polarity and potential negative contribution. For example, `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` has a positive value (0.689), but the CF3 and additional polar groups here may offset this.
4. **Chlorine substituents**: Chlorine can increase the property value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` has 2.159), but combined with CF3 and C=O, the effect may be balanced toward a slightly negative value.

### Comparison with similar examples:
- `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C` (CF3 + polar groups): **-0.603**
- `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (aromatic + NO2): **-0.506**
- `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (aromatic + NO2 + Cl): **-0.161**

The given molecule has stronger electron-withdrawing groups (CF3 and C=O) than NO2, so the property value is likely more negative than -0.6 but not as extreme as some highly negative examples (e.g., -0.87).

### Predicted property value:
Given the combined effects of CF3, C=O, and Cl, a reasonable prediction is **-0.65**. 

This aligns with similar molecules in the dataset where strong electron-withdrawing groups and polar functionalities result in values around -0.6 to -0.7. 

**Final answer: -0.65**

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.5069071970589536
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: Property = -0.69202984 (two nitro groups)
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2**: Property = -0.76787557 (no nitro group, but complex structure)
   - **ClC(Cl)(Cl)N(=O)=O**: Property = 2.25230025 (nitro group with highly chlorinated carbon)
   - Nitro groups generally seem to reduce the property value (negative or lower positive values) unless paired with highly halogenated or bulky groups.

2. **Methoxy Group (OCH3)**:
   - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC**: Property = -0.63495941 (two ester groups, not directly comparable)
   - **COc2ccc1ncccc1c2**: Property = -0.50133192 (methoxy + heterocycle)
   - Methoxy groups alone don't drastically increase the property value.

3. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., **c1ccccc1O**) have property values close to zero or slightly negative (-0.06008285).
   - Substitution with polar or electronegative groups (e.g., nitro, halogen) tends to reduce the property value.

4. **Combination of Methoxy and Nitro on Aromatic Ring**:
   - The molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has a methoxy group (electron-donating) and a nitro group (electron-withdrawing) on the same benzene ring. This combination is likely to result in a property value in the negative or slightly positive range, similar to other nitro-aromatics.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: Two nitro groups → -0.69202984
- **COc2ccc1ncccc1c2**: Methoxy + heterocycle → -0.50133192
- **c1ccccc1O**: Phenol → -0.06008285

Given that **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has one nitro group and one methoxy group, the property value is expected to be between -0.7 and -0.5, closer to the nitro-aromatic trend.

### Predicted Property Value:
Based on the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is approximately **-0.6**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.6** (approximate, likely between -0.7 and -0.5)

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 16.827366214461293
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and the presence of halogens (especially chlorine and bromine), which significantly increase the property value. The molecule in question is highly chlorinated, similar to `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (which has a value of **12.18411511**), but with even more chlorine atoms and a more complex polycyclic structure.

The molecule is:  
**ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**

This structure has **8 chlorine atoms** and a rigid, cage-like polycyclic framework, which would likely result in an even higher property value due to increased steric and electronic effects from the additional chlorines.  

### Prediction:  
Given the trend, this molecule should have a property value **higher than 12.18411511**. A reasonable estimate would be:  
**~14.5**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured—possibly something like molar refractivity, boiling point contribution, or a computed descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the strong influence of chlorine count and molecular rigidity in the examples.)

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.484796331322129
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes**: 
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexane): 1.50328858 (relatively high)
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): 0.6241427
   - **CC#N** (acetonitrile): 0.51475492
   - **CCCCC#C** (1-pentyne): 0.6241427 (same as butyne, suggesting terminal alkynes have similar values)
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (1-nonene): 0.94068764 (higher than alkynes)

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)...**: -0.98429209 (complex polyether, very negative)
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl phenyl ether): 0.10795641
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: -0.46676087 (ester with aromatic amine)
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1...**: -0.54450537 (cyclic imide)
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (sorbitol): 0.97926826 (polyol, positive)

3. **Esters**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: -0.46676087
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2**: -0.88986234 (more complex ester)
   - **CCCOC=O** is a simple ester (propyl formate), so we expect a value in the negative range but less extreme than complex esters.

4. **Halogenated Compounds**:
   - **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (hexachlorocyclohexane): 12.18411511 (very high)
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene): 1.05863226
   - Halogens generally increase the property value, especially with multiple halogens.

5. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)sc3ccccc23** (dibenzothiophene): -0.3575668
   - **O=N(=O)c1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): -0.69202984
   - Aromatics with electron-withdrawing groups tend to have negative values.

### Prediction for CCCOC=O (Propyl Formate):
- This is a simple aliphatic ester (formate ester with a propyl group). 
- From the examples, esters like **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** have a value of -0.46676087. 
- Propyl formate is less complex (no aromatic ring or additional functional groups), so its value should be less negative but still in the negative range. 
- The carbonyl (C=O) and ether (O) groups contribute to a negative property value, but the aliphatic chain (propyl) slightly offsets this.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **CCCOC=O** is:  
**-0.35** (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity, but the exact value would likely be between -0.3 and -0.4 based on the examples).

### Final Answer:
**-0.35** (approximate, based on structural similarity to other esters in the dataset). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. If the property is logP or another specific metric, the reasoning might differ slightly.)

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.484796331322129
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains (Alkanes/Alkenes):**
   - **CC** (ethane): 1.50328858  
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): 0.15405144  
   - **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (branched aldehyde): 0.81120822  
   - **CCCC=C(CC)C=O** (unsaturated aldehyde): 0.39821592  
   - **CCCCCC** (hexane): Likely similar to other alkanes (e.g., **CC** is 1.50328858, but longer chains may reduce the value slightly).  

   Hydrocarbon chains tend to have positive values, but branching/unsaturation can modulate this.

2. **Esters (R-COO-R'):**
   - **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C**: -0.65203593  
   - **C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(O)C(=O)OC(C)C**: -0.49002346  
   - **CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C**: -0.67250113  

   Esters often have negative property values, especially with aromatic or complex substituents.

3. **Functional Groups:**
   - **-OH (alcohols)**: Tend to reduce the value (e.g., **Oc1ccc(O)cc1**: -0.23763153).  
   - **-C=O (carbonyl)**: Can increase or decrease depending on context (e.g., aldehydes like **CCCCC(CC)C=O**: 0.81120822, but esters are negative).  
   - **-Br/-Cl (halogens)**: Increase the value significantly (e.g., **Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br**: 6.47258775).  

4. **Molecule in Question: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**
   - This is **decyl acetate** (CH₃(CH₂)₈COOCH₂CH₃), a long-chain ester.  
   - It has a long hydrocarbon chain (10 carbons) and an ester group (-COO-).  
   - From the examples:  
     - Long hydrocarbon chains (**CCCCCCc1ccccc1**: 0.15405144) suggest a slight positive contribution.  
     - Esters (e.g., **COCC(=O)N...**: -0.65203593) suggest a negative contribution.  
   - The long hydrocarbon chain may offset the ester's negative effect, but the ester is still dominant.  

### Prediction:
Given the dominance of the ester group and the long but non-aromatic hydrocarbon chain, the property value is likely **slightly negative**, similar to other esters but less negative due to the long alkyl chain.  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.3 to -0.5**  

Looking at similar examples:  
- **C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(O)C(=O)OC(C)C**: -0.49002346 (ester with aromatic and alkyl parts)  
- **COCC(=O)N...**: -0.65203593 (ester with complex substituents)  

For **decyl acetate (CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC)**, the value is likely closer to **-0.4**.  

### Final Answer:  
**Predicted property value: -0.4** (approximate, based on trends).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The property could be logP, solubility, or another descriptor, but the trend holds for hydrophobicity-like properties.)

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.8003241405384135
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic rings with substituents**: The molecule contains two benzene rings with multiple substituents (Cl, OH, C=O, NO2). 
   - Similar examples: 
     - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** has a value of **-0.76787557**.
     - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)c1ccccc1** has a value of **-0.75843005**.
     - **CC2Nc1cc(Cl)c(cc1C(=O)N2c3ccccc3C)S(N)(=O)=O** has a value of **-0.7319049**.
   - These molecules share features like aromatic rings with polar substituents (Cl, C=O, NO2, etc.) and have property values in the range of **-0.7 to -0.8**.

2. **Polar functional groups**: 
   - The molecule has a **hydroxyl (OH)**, **carbonyl (C=O)**, **nitro (NO2)**, and **chlorine (Cl)** groups, which are highly polar and likely contribute to lowering the property value (as seen in similar examples).

3. **NO2 group**: 
   - The presence of **N(=O)=O** (nitro group) is seen in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, which has a value of **-0.16183538**, but this molecule is simpler. In our case, the nitro group is combined with other polar groups, likely pushing the value further negative.

4. **Combined effects**: 
   - The combination of **OH**, **Cl**, **C=O**, and **NO2** suggests strong electron-withdrawing effects, similar to the examples with values around **-0.7 to -0.8**.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to molecules with values around **-0.7 to -0.8**, and considering the additional nitro group's effect, the predicted property value for **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O** is likely in this range. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.75** (specific value: **-0.75843005**, matching closely with **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)c1ccccc1**).

### Final Answer:
**-0.75843005**

Iteration: 76
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 0.5763825851157064
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds** (e.g., Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl, Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1) tend to have **high positive values** (e.g., ~1.73 to 1.98).  
2. **Polar or heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen/oxygen** (e.g., O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1, COc1ncnc2nccnc12) tend to have **negative values** (e.g., -0.39 to -0.61).  
3. **Aliphatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., CCCCCCCC, CCC(C)(C)C) tend to have **positive values** (e.g., ~1.50).  
4. **Sulfur-containing compounds** (e.g., CCSSCC, ClCCCCl) tend to have **very high positive values** (e.g., 3.91, 3.38).  

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1** has:
- **Two phosphate groups (P=S)**: These are polar and electronegative, which might suggest a negative contribution.  
- **Aromatic rings with sulfur linkages (S)**: Sulfur tends to increase the property value significantly (as seen in CCSSCC or ClCCCCl).  
- **Ether linkages (Oc)**: These are polar but may not dominate over the sulfur effect.  

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The molecule resembles **ClCCCCl** (3.38) and **CCSSCC** (3.91) due to the sulfur bridges, but it also has polar phosphate groups that could offset the sulfur effect slightly.  
- The presence of **two P=S groups** and **two sulfur bridges** suggests a **very high positive value**, but the polar groups might temper it somewhat compared to pure aliphatic sulfides.  

### Predicted Value:
Given the dominance of sulfur and the structural similarity to high-value examples, the predicted property value is likely in the range of **3.5 to 4.0**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**3.75**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend that sulfur and phosphorus increase the value significantly, while polar groups moderate it slightly.)

Iteration: 77
SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.5069071970589536
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitrophenol-like structures**: The molecule is a nitrophenol derivative (phenol with a nitro group). Similar molecules in the dataset include:
   - **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2**: Property = -0.60811432
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: Property = -0.38484537
   - **Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**: Property = 0.26430298

   The nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) tends to reduce the property value (more negative) compared to simple substituted phenols.

2. **Phenol derivatives**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O**: Property = -0.46676087
   - **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**: Property = -0.06008285
   Phenols without strong electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro) have less negative or slightly positive values.

3. **Electron-withdrawing effects**:
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which likely further reduces the property value compared to other substituents (e.g., halogens or alkyl groups).

4. **Comparison to closest match**:
   - **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** has a property of -0.60811432. This is a more complex molecule with two chlorine atoms and an ether linkage, but the nitro group is present.
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (simpler nitrobenzene derivative) has a property of -0.38484537.

   The target molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is a nitrophenol, which is intermediate in complexity between these two. The hydroxyl group (`OH`) is electron-donating, while the nitro group is electron-withdrawing, likely leading to a balance but still a negative value.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is expected to be slightly more negative than **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (-0.384) but less negative than the more substituted **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (-0.608). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property = -0.46676087**  

This matches the value seen for **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (another phenol derivative with an electron-withdrawing group), which seems consistent with the nitrophenol's electronic effects. 

### Final Answer:
- **Predicted property for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: **-0.46676087**

Iteration: 78
SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 0.3296916287986067
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group composition. The molecule in question is a highly oxygenated carbohydrate (a sugar derivative, likely a oligosaccharide or polysaccharide fragment) with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) and ether (-O-) groups, which are polar and can form hydrogen bonds.

From the examples:
- Molecules with many polar groups (especially -OH) tend to have property values in the range of **0.5 to 1.5** (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has a value of **1.05863226**).
- The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups increases the value compared to less polar or nonpolar molecules.
- The given molecule is larger and more highly functionalized than `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`, so its value should be higher.

Given this, the predicted property value for:
`OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O`

is likely in the range of **1.2 to 1.6**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: 1.45**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, refractive index, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)
==================================================
Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.6241427040820582
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkanes and Alkenes/Alkynes**:
   - **CCCC(=O)C** (2-pentanone): 0.81120822  
   - **CCCCCC=O** (hexanal): 0.81120822  
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (1-nonene): 0.94068764  
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (4-heptanol): 1.40757086  
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (1-hexadecanol): 1.40757086  
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (1-octadecanol): 1.40757086  

   These suggest that longer hydrocarbon chains with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O) tend to have higher positive values, while simple alkenes/alkynes have intermediate values.

2. **Alkynes**:
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (1,4-dicyanobenzene): -0.61723085  
     This is an aromatic system with two nitrile groups, so it's not directly comparable to **CCC#C**.  
   - No other alkynes are present in the examples, but we can infer that alkynes (like alkenes) likely have values between 0 and 1 unless strongly polar or conjugated.

3. **Small Hydrocarbons**:
   - **Fc1cccc(F)c1** (1,4-difluorobenzene): 0.0  
   - **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1** (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene): 0.15405144  
   - **Cc1cncc(C)c1** (2,4-dimethylpyridine): 0.07450112  

   Small hydrocarbons or simple substituted aromatics tend to have values close to 0 or slightly positive.

4. **Polarity and Functional Groups**:
   - Highly polar or conjugated systems (e.g., nitro groups, amides, multiple halogens) tend to have negative values.  
   - Nonpolar hydrocarbons or those with single polar groups (e.g., -OH) tend to have positive values.

### Prediction for **CCC#C**:
- **CCC#C** is a small alkyne (4 carbons, terminal triple bond).  
- It lacks strong polarity or conjugation (unlike aromatic or polyfunctional molecules).  
- Compared to similar small hydrocarbons (e.g., **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1**: 0.154, **Cc1cncc(C)c1**: 0.075), we expect a slightly positive value.  
- It is less polar than alcohols or carbonyls (which have higher positive values) but more polar than pure alkanes.  

Given the absence of exact alkynes in the examples, we interpolate based on similar-sized molecules:  
- Likely value: **~0.2 to 0.5**.  

A reasonable estimate is **0.3**, but since the examples show clustering around specific values (e.g., 0.811 for ketones, 1.407 for alcohols), we might pick a nearby representative value.  

Given **Cc1cncc(C)c1** (0.074) and **CCCC(=O)C** (0.811), **CCC#C** likely falls between these.  

### Final Prediction:
**0.4** (interpolated based on size and polarity).  

However, looking at the examples more closely, **CCCC(=O)C** (5-carbon ketone) is 0.811, and **CCCCCC=O** (6-carbon aldehyde) is also 0.811. Smaller nonpolar hydrocarbons are lower (e.g., **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1**: 0.154).  

For **CCC#C** (4-carbon alkyne), a plausible value is **~0.5**.  

But to match the pattern of the given data more precisely, the closest fit is **0.48479633** (seen for **CC(C)OC=O** and **CC(C)CCOC(=O)C**).  

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCC#C** is:  
**0.48479633** (matching the trend for small, moderately polar molecules).  

### Exact Answer:
**0.48479633** (same as **CC(C)OC=O** and **CC(C)CCOC(=O)C**).  

This aligns with the observed clustering of similar-sized molecules in the training data.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 3.0581356077530413
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: Present in the molecule, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 1.27055426) and **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** (property = 1.18339612). These molecules have moderately positive property values (~1.2–1.3).  
2. **Aromatic Ring with Multiple Chlorines**: The **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** fragment resembles **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl** (property = 1.73222924) and **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 1.98130926). These heavily chlorinated aromatics have high positive values.  
3. **Ethoxy Group (CCO)**: Neutral/slightly polar, unlikely to dominate the property.  

### Combined Effect:
- The phosphorothioate group contributes a value around **1.2–1.3**.  
- The trichlorinated aromatic ring pushes the value higher (e.g., +1.7 to +2.0).  
- The ethoxy group is less influential.  

### Prediction:
The molecule combines a phosphorothioate with a heavily chlorinated aromatic system, likely resulting in a property value **between 1.2 and 1.8**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.450**  

This aligns with the trend where phosphorothioates with chlorinated aromatics exhibit elevated values but not as extreme as fully chlorinated hydrocarbons (e.g., ClC(Br)Br = 7.29).  

*Note: Without explicit knowledge of the property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on structural similarity to the provided examples.*

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.4111206736031586
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a pyridine derivative (6-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen, `c1nccc...c1`), substituted with a **C(=O)NN** group (a hydrazide or hydrazone-like fragment).
2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Aromatic nitrogen (pyridine-like) tends to decrease the property value (see examples like `Nc1ccccc1Cl` with 0.264 or `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` with -0.461).
   - The **C(=O)NN** group is polar and likely hydrogen-bonding, which typically reduces the property value (similar to amides or other polar groups in the examples).

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Polar/Aromatic Nitrogen**: Molecules like `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (-0.461) or `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (-0.507) have aromatic nitrogens and polar groups, yielding negative values.
- **Amide-like Groups**: `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (-0.010) has an amide, but the property is less negative due to bulky substituents. The **C(=O)NN** here is even more polar (hydrazide), suggesting a more negative value.
- **Pyridine Core**: `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` (-0.684) has multiple nitrogens and fused rings, giving a moderately negative value.

### Prediction:
Given the pyridine core + highly polar hydrazide group, the property value should be **more negative** than simple aromatic amines but less extreme than large polyaromatics. A reasonable estimate is between **-0.6 and -0.8**.

From the examples, `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` (-0.684) is a close analog (nitrogen-rich aromatic + polar groups). The hydrazide here may further reduce the value slightly.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.72** (rounded to match the precision of the examples).  

This aligns with the trend that polar/aromatic nitrogens and hydrogen-bonding groups reduce the property value significantly.

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 2.65106083224943
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: This is a polar and moderately bulky group. Similar structures with P(=S) (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**) have a property value of **-0.08888134**. This suggests that P(=S) contributes to lowering the property value, likely due to polarity or steric effects.
2. **Thioether Linkage (SCC(=O))**: The sulfur atom in the thioether (not highly oxidized) may slightly increase the property value compared to an ether, but the adjacent carbonyl (C=O) will counterbalance this with polarity.
3. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: Amides are polar and often reduce the property value (e.g., **CCOC(=O)N** has **0.21415309**, while **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** has **0.21415309**). Here, the amide is part of a ring, which may slightly reduce its impact.
4. **Alkyl Chains (CCCC, OCCC)**: These are nonpolar and typically contribute to higher property values (e.g., **CCCCCCCI** has **4.05772219**), but their effect is mitigated by polar groups.
5. **Cyclohexane Ring (N1CCCCC1)**: Nonpolar, but the nitrogen substitution introduces polarity. Compare to **C/C1CCCCC1\C** (property **1.50328858**), but the nitrogen here will lower the value.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**: Property = **-0.08888134**. This has a P(=S) group and aromatic nitro groups, which are highly polar. Our molecule lacks nitro groups but has an amide and thioether, which are less polar but still significant.
- **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C**: Property = **0.21415309**. This is a simple amide with dimethyl substitution. Our molecule has a more complex amide in a ring, likely reducing the value further.
- **CCBr**: Property = **2.98096824**. This is a simple alkyl bromide, illustrating how halogens increase the value. Our molecule has no halogens but has P(=S) and S, which are less electronegative than halogens but still polar.

### Synthesis of Observations:
- The P(=S) group suggests a value around **-0.08** (from the example), but our molecule has additional polar groups (amide, thioether) that will further reduce the value.
- The alkyl chains and cyclohexane ring would push the value higher, but the polar groups dominate.
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**, but our molecule replaces the nitroaromatic with less polar (but still polar) groups. Thus, the value should be slightly higher than **-0.08888134** but still negative.

### Predicted Property:
Considering the balance of polar (P(=S), amide, thioether) and nonpolar (alkyl, cyclohexane) groups, the predicted property value is approximately:  
**-0.05**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend that polar groups reduce the value and nonpolar groups increase it. The value is likely in the range of **-0.1 to 0.1**, leaning slightly negative due to the amide and P(=S).  

For a more precise prediction, the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.) would need to be specified, but based on the given examples, **-0.05** is a reasonable estimate.  

---  
**Final Answer:** **-0.05** (approximate, based on structural similarity to given examples).  

(If more context about the property is provided, the prediction can be refined further.)

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 1.5032885794935091
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to correlate with molecular size, polarity, and functional groups. For simple alkanes (hydrocarbons with no functional groups), the property tends to be positive and increases slightly with chain length but plateaus for longer chains. 

Examples:
- `ClCCBr` (small polar molecule): 4.25462965  
- `CC(Cl)Cl`: 3.38167798  
- `CCC(O)CC`: 1.40757086  
- `C/C1CCCCC1\C` (cyclohexane): 1.50328858  
- `CCCCCCCO`: 1.40757086  
- `CCCC/C=C/C`: 0.94068764  

The molecule `CCCCCCCC` (octane) is a nonpolar alkane with no functional groups, similar to `CCCCCCCO` (heptanol, but with a terminal OH replaced by H) and `CCCC/C=C/C` (unsaturated hydrocarbon). Given the trend, its property value should be close to other medium-length alkanes, likely slightly lower than cyclic or branched alkanes but higher than very small molecules.  

**Predicted property value for `CCCCCCCC`: ~1.40**  

A reasonable estimate would be **1.40757086** (same as `CCC(O)CC`, `CC(C)CO`, etc., since the property seems to stabilize for nonpolar chains of this size).  

(Note: If the property is something like logP or hydrophobicity, this aligns well—longer alkanes have similar incremental increases in logP until saturation.)

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: -0.17923548440253834
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a multi-ring structure resembling steroids (e.g., **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O**, which has a property value of **0.34314092**). This suggests a moderately positive contribution to the property.
2. **Ketone group (=O)**: Present in one of the rings, similar to other steroid-like molecules in the examples. This group often correlates with slightly negative or neutral values.
3. **Hydroxyl group (-OH)**: Present at two positions (C1 and C4), which can slightly reduce the property value (as seen in other hydroxyl-containing molecules).
4. **Alkyne group (C#C)**: This is a unique feature not explicitly present in the examples, but alkynes are generally hydrophobic and may slightly increase the property value (similar to alkenes like **C=C**, which has a high value of **0.94068764**).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O**: Property = **0.34314092** (steroid with ketone and hydroxyl).
- **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**: Property = **-0.37812126** (more polar due to additional -F and -CO groups).
- **C=C**: Property = **0.94068764** (alkene, similar to alkyne but likely more extreme).

### Prediction:
The given molecule is structurally closest to the first example (**0.34314092**) but with an additional alkyne group (likely increasing the value) and an extra hydroxyl group (likely decreasing the value slightly). Balancing these effects, the predicted property value should be **slightly higher than 0.34314092** but not as extreme as pure alkyne/alkene examples.

### Final Prediction:
**0.45** (estimated based on structural trends in the examples). 

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data patterns.)*

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -0.9842920941048315
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, I'll analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples to predict the property value.

**Molecule to predict:**
```
COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
```

### Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings (e.g., `c1cc(cc(OC)c1O)` and `c7cc5OCOc5cc67`), which are also present in many of the examples. Aromaticity often correlates with lower property values (e.g., `c1ccccc1` has 0.154, while polyaromatics like `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54` have -0.871).
2. **Oxygen-containing functional groups**:
   - Ethers (`OC`, `OCO`): Present in many examples (e.g., `CCCCOCCO` has 1.315, `COc1ccccc1Cl` has 0.264). Ethers tend to increase the property value slightly.
   - Alcohols (`OH` or `O` attached to aliphatic carbons): Present in examples like `OCc1ccccc1` (0.108) and `Oc1ccccc1Cl` (0.264). Alcohols also tend to increase the property value modestly.
   - Carbonyl groups (`C=O`): Present in examples like `CCCCCCC(=O)C` (0.811) and `COC(=O)c1ccccc1` (-0.336). The effect depends on context, but aliphatic carbonyls often increase the value.
3. **Heterocycles**: The molecule contains oxygen-containing heterocycles (e.g., `OCOc5cc67`). Similar to furans or dioxolanes, these can lower the property value (e.g., `c2ccc1ocnc1c2` has -0.336).
4. **Size and branching**: The molecule is large and highly branched, similar to `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` (0.724). Larger, branched molecules often have moderate positive values.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule is most similar to large, oxygen-rich polycyclic structures like `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` (0.724) but with more aromaticity and heterocycles.
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings and heterocycles would lower the value compared to purely aliphatic examples like `CCCCOCCO` (1.315).
- The carbonyl and ether groups would offset some of the decrease from aromaticity.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of aromaticity (lowering the value) and oxygen-containing functional groups (raising the value), the predicted property value is likely in the **moderate positive range**, similar to other large, oxygenated polycyclic molecules in the examples.

**Prediction: ~0.65**  
(Closest matches: `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl` at 0.689, `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` at 0.724)

Iteration: 86
SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 0.2643029840185254
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on the functional groups and substituents present.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol): -0.5069072
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (another nitrophenol): -0.5069072
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (same as above): -0.5069072
   - Phenol derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂) tend to have negative property values around -0.5.

2. **Chlorinated Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene): 2.15941974
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): 2.94292335
   - Chlorine substituents generally increase the property value, especially with multiple chlorines.

3. **Mixed Substituents (OH and Cl)**:
   - **Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I** (diiodo-cyanophenol): 1.43116509
   - **COc1c(O)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (trichlorodimethoxyphenol): 1.45498139
   - When OH and Cl are both present, the property value tends to be positive but lower than heavily chlorinated aromatics.

4. **Simple Chlorophenol**:
   - The molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** has one OH and one Cl substituent on the benzene ring. This is less chlorinated than the examples with multiple Cl atoms but more substituted than simple phenol (which is not in the examples but would likely have a lower value).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Phenol with NO₂ (strong electron-withdrawing) gives ~-0.5.
- Chlorine increases the property value (e.g., chloroiodobenzene: 2.15).
- Mixed OH/Cl substituents give values around 1.4-1.5.

For **Oc1ccccc1Cl**, the OH is electron-donating and the Cl is weakly electron-withdrawing. The net effect is likely a moderate positive value, but lower than heavily chlorinated compounds. 

A reasonable estimate is **~0.5**, interpolating between the nitrophenol (-0.5) and the diiodo-cyanophenol (1.43). However, since Cl is less electron-withdrawing than NO₂ but more than H, the value should be higher than nitrophenol but lower than multi-halogenated phenols. 

Looking at **Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I** (1.43) and **COc1c(O)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (1.45), a single Cl and OH might give a value slightly lower, around **0.7-1.0**. 

But in the absence of an exact match, a conservative estimate is **0.8**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is **0.8**. 

(Note: If more precise interpolation is needed, the value could be refined to ~0.7-0.9, but 0.8 is a reasonable midpoint.)

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -0.37812125545355746
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Cl-substituted aromatic ring**: `c1cccc(Cl)c1` (similar to `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)...` in some examples).
   - **Amide linkage**: `OC(=O)N` (similar to `NC(=O)` in examples like `CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1` with property -0.336).
   - **Alkyne group**: `C#C` (not directly present in examples, but triple bonds are rare in the dataset).
   - **Ether linkage**: `COC` (present in many examples, e.g., `COc1ncnc2nccnc12` with property -0.608).
   - **Chlorinated alkyl chain**: `ClCC` (similar to `CCCCl` with property 2.316, but shorter here).

2. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - The molecule has multiple polar groups (amide, ether, Cl substituents), which typically lower the property value (as seen in most negative examples).
   - The alkyne may slightly increase hydrophobicity, but its effect is likely minor compared to the polar groups.

3. **Comparison to Similar Examples**:
   - `CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1` (property: -0.467) is structurally similar (aromatic + amide + ether), though with fewer Cl substituents.
   - `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (property: -0.020) has multiple halogens and amide, but is less polar overall.
   - `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (property: -0.089) has a Cl-substituted aromatic system but lacks polar amide/ether.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of:
- Aromatic Cl substitution (moderate effect).
- Polar amide and ether linkages (strong negative effect).
- Alkyne (minor effect, likely negligible here).

The property value is expected to be **negative and moderately low**, similar to other polar/amide-containing molecules in the dataset. A reasonable estimate is between **-0.4 and -0.6**.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.50** (approximate, based on structural analogy to similar molecules). 

*Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on trends in the given data.*

Iteration: 88
SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: -0.6764803901106632
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains three aromatic rings (two benzene rings and one pyridine-like ring with `c2cncnc2`). Aromaticity is associated with negative property values in the examples (e.g., `N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has -0.5988).
2. **Chlorine substituents**: Two chlorine atoms are attached to aromatic rings. Chlorine on aromatics tends to increase the property value slightly (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` has 1.0586, but when combined with other features, the effect may vary).
3. **Hydroxyl group (OH)**: An OH group attached to a central carbon. Polar groups like OH can reduce the property value (e.g., `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` has -0.2376).
4. **Central carbon with three substituents**: The central carbon binds two aromatic rings and an OH group, similar to sterically hindered or branched structures. Branched/aliphatic structures (e.g., `CC(C)C(C)C`) have positive values, but here the aromatic dominance may override this.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings with heteroatoms (e.g., `c2cncnc2`) and Cl substituents is reminiscent of molecules like `ClC2=C(Cl)C3(Cl)C1C=CCC1C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl` (7.0619), but our molecule lacks the extreme halogenation.
- The combination of OH and aromatic systems is seen in `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` (-0.2376) and `Oc1cccc2ncccc12` (-0.5013), suggesting a negative contribution.
- The `c2cncnc2` ring is somewhat similar to `Nc1nc[nH]n1` (-0.1351), but our molecule is more conjugated.

### Synthesis of Trends:
1. Aromatic rings with heteroatoms and polar groups (OH) tend to pull the property negative.
2. Chlorine substituents on aromatics can push the value slightly positive, but not enough to outweigh the aromatic/OH effect.
3. The central carbon with three bulky groups may add slight steric complexity but is unlikely to dominate.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the dominance of aromaticity and polar groups, the value is likely **negative but not extremely so**. Comparing to similar structures, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.75** (with uncertainty around ±0.15 based on the examples).  

### Final Answer:
**-0.75** (approximate predicted value).  

*Note: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, dipole moment, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends.*

Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 0.484796331322129
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Carbon Chain Length and Branching**:
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate) has a property value of **0.48479633**.
   - **CCCCBr** (1-bromobutane) has a much higher value of **2.98096824**, likely due to the presence of bromine.
   - **CCCCCC=O** (hexanal) has a value of **0.81120822**, similar to **CCCCCCCCC(=O)C** (2-nonanone), which also has a carbonyl group and a longer chain.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with **carbonyl groups (C=O)** in esters or aldehydes tend to have moderate positive values (e.g., **CCCC(=O)OCC** at 0.484, **CCCCCC=O** at 0.811).
   - **Ethers (e.g., CCOC)** are present in some molecules but don't drastically alter the property unless combined with other features.
   - **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)** and **halogens (Br, Cl, I)** significantly increase or decrease the property depending on context.

3. **CCCCOC=O (butyl formate)**:
   - This is an ester with a **formate group (HCOO-)** attached to a butyl chain.
   - Structurally, it is similar to **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate), which has a value of **0.48479633**, but with a shorter ester group (formate instead of butyrate).
   - The formate group might slightly reduce the property compared to larger esters due to its smaller size and lower hydrophobicity.

4. **Comparison to Other Esters/Alcohols**:
   - **CCOc1ccc(NC(N)=O)cc1** has a value of **-0.57482714**, but this is influenced by the aromatic ring and amide group.
   - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C...** (a complex steroid-like molecule) has **-0.82190915**, but this is not directly comparable due to its size and multiple functional groups.

### Prediction:
Given that **CCCCOC=O** is a simple ester with a butyl chain and a formate group, its property value is likely slightly lower than **CCCC(=O)OCC** (0.484) but still positive, similar to other small carbonyl-containing molecules. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value for CCCCOC=O: 0.45**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples. For precise predictions, computational tools or QSAR models would be needed.)
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 3.381677975584457
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for **ClCCl** (dichloromethane), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values.

### Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Compounds**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of **3.38167798**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene) has a property value of **3.775856**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **0.26430298**.
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (chloroaniline) has a property value of **0.26430298** (same as dichlorobenzene, suggesting the amine group doesn't significantly alter the property in this case).

   These examples suggest that chlorinated aliphatic compounds (like ClCCCl) tend to have higher property values (e.g., ~3.38) compared to chlorinated aromatic compounds (e.g., ~0.26 for dichlorobenzene).

2. **Aliphatic vs. Aromatic Chlorides**:
   - Aliphatic chlorides (e.g., ClCCCl) have higher values (~3.38).
   - Aromatic chlorides (e.g., dichlorobenzene) have lower values (~0.26).

3. **Dichloromethane (ClCCl)**:
   - This is an aliphatic chloride with **two chlorines on a single carbon**, similar to ClCCCl (1,2-dichloroethane) but with a shorter chain.
   - The property value for ClCCCl is **3.38167798**, and hexachlorobenzene (with more chlorines) is even higher (3.775856).
   - Since ClCCl has fewer chlorines than hexachlorobenzene but is aliphatic like ClCCCl, we might expect its value to be slightly lower than ClCCCl but still high.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- ClCCCl (2 chlorines on adjacent carbons) = 3.38167798,
- ClCCl (2 chlorines on the same carbon) is structurally simpler but similarly aliphatic, we might expect a slightly lower value due to reduced molecular weight/chlorine count.

A reasonable estimate for **ClCCl** is **~3.2 to 3.4**. Given the examples, I'll predict a value close to ClCCCl but slightly lower:

**Predicted property value for ClCCl: 3.2** (approximate, likely between 3.0 and 3.4 based on the trend). 

However, since ClCCCl is 3.38 and ClCCl is even simpler, a more precise estimate might be **3.0**. 

Given the lack of exact matches, the closest guess is **3.0**. 

But reviewing the examples again, **ClCCCl** is 3.38, and **ClCCl** is smaller, so perhaps **3.0** is reasonable. 

Alternatively, if we consider that **ClCCl** is smaller but similarly chlorinated, it might still be close to **3.38**. 

Given the uncertainty, I'll predict **3.2** as a midpoint. 

However, looking at **CCBr** and **CCCCCCCCBr**, both have the same value (2.98), suggesting that chain length doesn't always affect the property for halides. Thus, **ClCCl** might be similar to **ClCCCl** (~3.38).

Final answer: **3.38** (same as ClCCCl, as the number of chlorines may dominate over chain length). 

But since **ClCCl** has fewer chlorines than **ClCCCl**, perhaps slightly lower: **3.2**.

Given the examples, the most consistent prediction is **3.38** (same as ClCCCl, as the property may not strongly depend on chain length for simple halides). 

Thus, the predicted value for **ClCCl** is **3.38**. 

However, this seems high, so perhaps **3.0** is better. 

Given the ambiguity, I'll settle on **3.0** as a conservative estimate. 

But the examples suggest aliphatic chlorides are ~3.38, so **3.38** is likely correct.

**Final predicted property value for ClCCl: 3.38** (same as ClCCCl, as the property may not vary much for simple aliphatic chlorides). 

---

**Answer: 3.38** (same as ClCCCl, based on the trend for aliphatic chlorides in the examples).

   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: Property = -0.5069072

   These molecules have an aromatic ring with an -OH group, and their property values range from -0.5 to -0.06. The presence of additional substituents (e.g., nitro groups, alkyl chains) tends to shift the value.

2. **Methyl-substituted phenol**:
   - The molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is a dimethylphenol (specifically, 2,5-dimethylphenol). It has two methyl groups (-CH3) and one hydroxyl group (-OH) on the aromatic ring.

3. **Comparison with similar structures**:
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (a tert-butyl and methyl-substituted phenol) has a property value of -0.06008285.
   - The simpler phenol **Oc1cccc(O)c1** has a value of -0.23763153.
   - The presence of alkyl groups (like methyl or tert-butyl) tends to increase the property value (make it less negative) compared to unsubstituted phenol.

### Prediction:
- **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** has two methyl groups, which are less bulky than a tert-butyl group but still contribute to increasing the property value compared to phenol.
- The value is likely slightly more negative than **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (-0.06008285) but less negative than **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (-0.23763153).

### Estimated Property Value:
A reasonable estimate would be around **-0.15 to -0.10**. Given the examples, a plausible specific value is:

**Predicted property value: -0.12**  

*(This is an interpolation based on the trend observed in the data, where alkyl substitution reduces the magnitude of the negative property value.)*

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.6899470822311845
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe that the property values tend to increase with the presence of halogens (especially chlorine and bromine) and decrease with the presence of polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., -OH, -NH, -NO2, -C=O). The property also seems to correlate with molecular size and aromaticity, but halogen substitution has a dominant effect.

Key observations:
1. Molecules with multiple chlorine substitutions (e.g., Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl) have high positive values (1.248 to 1.981).
2. The presence of aromatic rings without halogens tends to give negative or near-zero values.
3. The property appears additive for halogens, as seen in Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br (6.473) and ClCBr (4.255).

The molecule in question is:  
**Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**

This is a biphenyl structure with 5 chlorine substitutions (two on one ring, three on the other). Comparing to similar structures:
- Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (4 Cl) has a value of 1.248  
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (7 Cl) has a value of 1.981  
- Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl (4 Cl) has a value of 1.981  

The given molecule has 5 chlorines, intermediate between these examples. The biphenyl core may slightly increase the value compared to single-ring systems.  

Given the additive trend and the structural similarity, the predicted property value is:  
**1.65**  

(Note: This is an estimate based on interpolation between the closest examples. The actual value would likely fall between 1.25 and 1.98, with 1.65 being a reasonable midpoint for 5 chlorines on a biphenyl scaffold.)

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.9406876400070361
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isobutylene), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Alkenes**:
   - **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (branched aldehyde): 0.81120822
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): 0.94068764
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): 1.50328858
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane): 1.50328858
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a branched alkene (isobutylene), similar to the above examples but smaller.

2. **Branched vs. Linear**:
   - Branched hydrocarbons tend to have higher property values than linear ones (e.g., **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** vs. **CCCCCCCC** both have 1.50328858, but branching doesn't lower the value).
   - The presence of a double bond (**C=C**) slightly reduces the property compared to saturated analogs (e.g., **CCCCCCCCC=C** is 0.94068764 vs. **CCCCCCCC** is 1.50328858).

3. **Smaller Branched Alkenes**:
   - **CC=C(C)C** is smaller than the examples above, so its value should be lower than **CCCCCCCCC=C** (0.94068764) but higher than small polar molecules (which often have negative values).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Branched alkenes have values between ~0.8 and ~1.5.
- Smaller size reduces the value slightly compared to larger branched alkenes.
- No polar or aromatic groups are present (which would lower the value).

A reasonable estimate for **CC=C(C)C** is **~0.8**, similar to **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (0.81120822) but slightly lower due to the smaller size.

### Final Predicted Value:
**0.75** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The property could be logP, solubility, or another molecular descriptor, but the trend suggests higher values for nonpolar, branched hydrocarbons.)

Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 3.381677975584457
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here are some key observations:

1. **Simple alkanes and alcohols** (e.g., `CCCC1CCCC1`, `CC(C)C(C)C`, `CCCC(C)C`, `CC(C)C(C)O`) tend to have **positive property values around 1.4 to 1.5**.
2. **Aromatic systems with polar groups** (e.g., `CC(C)(C)c1ccc(O)cc1`, `Oc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`) tend to have **negative property values**.
3. **Highly halogenated (especially chlorinated) molecules** tend to have **very high positive property values**, especially when multiple chlorines are present (e.g., `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a value of **4.20470891**, and `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` has a value of **16.82736621**).
4. **Small chlorinated molecules** (e.g., `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` with 4 chlorines has a value of **4.94800786**).

The molecule in question is **ClCCl** (dichloromethane, CH₂Cl₂). This is a small chlorinated molecule with **two chlorines**. Comparing to similar structures:
- `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) has a value of **4.94800786** (4 chlorines).
- `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)...` (hexachlorobenzene-like) has a value of **4.20470891** (6 chlorines).

Since **ClCCl** has fewer chlorines (2) than these examples, we expect its property value to be **lower but still positive**. 

Given the trend, a reasonable prediction for **ClCCl** is around **1.5 to 3.0**. 

A more precise estimate based on the examples:
- The presence of two chlorines suggests a value **lower than 4.2 but higher than simple alkanes (1.5)**.
- A plausible interpolation gives a value around **2.5**.

### Predicted property value for **ClCCl**:  
**2.5** (approximate, likely between 2.0 and 3.0).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends.)*

Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 1.2484575919628509
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values. For example:
     - **OC1C=CC2C1C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl** has a high value of **6.76170111** (6 Cl atoms).
     - **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** has a value of **3.73039943** (3 Br atoms, halogens behave similarly to Cl).
     - **ClCC** has a value of **2.31568671** (1 Cl atom).
     - **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** has a value of **1.24845759** (3 Cl atoms).
   - The presence of Cl increases the property value, and the more Cl atoms, the higher the value.

2. **Phenol (OH attached to benzene)**:
   - Phenol derivatives with no or few Cl atoms tend to have lower or moderate values. For example:
     - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** has a value of **0.10795641** (no Cl).
     - **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** has a value of **1.24845759** (3 Cl atoms).

3. **Specific Case for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**:
   - This molecule is a trichlorophenol (OH and 3 Cl atoms on a benzene ring). 
   - It is very similar to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (value = 1.24845759), except the Cl substitution pattern is slightly different (1,2,4-trichlorophenol vs. 1,2,3-trichlorophenol). The property value should be close to this.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (value = 1.24845759) and the fact that both are trichlorophenols, the property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** should be very close. The slight difference in Cl substitution pattern may not significantly alter the value. 

Thus, the predicted property value is approximately:  
**1.25** (rounded to two decimal places for readability, but the exact value would likely be close to 1.24845759).

### Final Answer:
**1.24845759** (or approximately **1.25**)

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -0.9842920941048315
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group contributions (e.g., nitro groups, carbonyls, halogens, etc.). The property appears to be a computed or experimental descriptor, possibly related to logP (lipophilicity), solubility, or another physicochemical parameter.

### Analysis of the target molecule:
**SMILES:** `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67`  

Breaking it down:
1. **Aromatic rings with polar substituents**:  
   - `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)` → Methoxy and hydroxy groups on benzene (polar, H-bond donors/acceptors).  
   - `c7cc5OCOc5cc67` → Dioxole-fused aromatic ring (polar, H-bond acceptors).  

2. **Oxygen-rich aliphatic regions**:  
   - `C6C2C(COC2=O)` → Lactone (polar, H-bond acceptor).  
   - `OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O` → Furanose/pyranose-like sugar moiety (highly polar, multiple H-bond donors/acceptors).  

3. **Overall**:  
   The molecule is highly polar due to the abundance of ethers, hydroxyls, and a lactone. It lacks large hydrophobic regions or halogens, which in the examples tend to increase the property value (e.g., `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` has a high value of 4.948).  

### Comparison to examples:
- **High-polarity, low-value examples**:  
  - `O=C1CNC(=O)N1` (cyclic urea, polar): **-0.135**  
  - `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (nitrophenol, polar): **-0.507**  
  - `OCC(O)CO` (glycerol, very polar): **1.227** (note: this is an outlier; likely an error in the given data, as glycerol should have a low logP).  

- **Low-polarity, high-value examples**:  
  - `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` (alkane): **1.503**  
  - `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` (chlorinated benzene): **1.732**  

### Prediction:
The target molecule is **far more polar** than most examples, with multiple H-bond donors/acceptors and no significant hydrophobic regions. Its closest analogs in the examples are highly oxygenated structures like `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (value: **0.624**) and `OCC(O)CO` (value: **1.227**), but the target is even more polar due to the dioxole and lactone.  

Given the trend, the predicted property value is likely **negative**, similar to other polar, polyoxygenated molecules in the dataset.  

### Final prediction:
**-0.35** (approximate, based on the closest matches).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess. If the property is logP, the value would likely be more negative; if it’s another descriptor, adjustments might be needed.)

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.11688174839296955
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - Molecules with **halogens (Cl, Br)** tend to have higher positive values (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl` = 1.732, `ClC(Br)Br` = 7.294).
   - Molecules with **polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NH, -CO)** often have negative values (e.g., `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1` = -0.343, `O=C1N(C2CCC(=O)NC2=O)C(=O)c3ccccc13` = -0.849).
   - **Aromatic systems** with no polar groups tend to have values around -0.06 to 0.15 (e.g., `c1ccccc1O` = -0.060, `C1Cc2ccccc2C1` = 0.154).

2. **Similar Structures**:
   - The molecule `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (property = -0.261) shares some similarity with the target molecule:
     - Both have a **thioether (S)** group.
     - Both have a **tetramethyl (C(C)(C)C)** group.
     - Both have **heterocyclic nitrogen (nnc)** and **amide (=O)** features.
   - The molecule `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1` (property = -0.343) also shares similarities (amide and nitrogen heterocycle).

3. **Key Features of the Target Molecule**:
   - **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**:
     - Contains a **thioether (CS)** group.
     - Contains a **tetramethyl (C(C)(C)C)** group.
     - Contains a **heterocyclic nitrogen (nnc)** and **amide (=O)**.
     - No halogens or strongly electron-withdrawing groups.

### Prediction:
Given the similarities to molecules with properties around **-0.26 to -0.34**, and considering the presence of the thioether (which may slightly increase the value compared to pure amide/nitrogen heterocycles), a reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.30**  

This aligns with the range observed for similar structures in the examples.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.33642650190913415
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Alcohols**: 
   - **CC** (ethane) has a high positive value (1.50328858).
   - **CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane) also has the same value (1.50328858).
   - Molecules with **OH groups** and aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCC(O)CCC**, **CCC(C)CO**) tend to have a value of **1.40757086**.

2. **Aromatic Rings and Functional Groups**:
   - **o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (dibenzofuran-like structure) has a negative value (-0.59882538).
   - **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenyl ether) has the same negative value (-0.59882538), suggesting aromaticity and ether linkages contribute similarly.
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a slightly negative value (-0.06008285).
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitro-substituted toluene) has a negative value (-0.38484537), similar to other nitro-aromatics.

3. **Esters and Carbonyl-Containing Compounds**:
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate) has a value of **0.48479633**.
   - **CCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl hexanoate) also has the same value (0.48479633).
   - **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C** (complex ester) has a negative value (-0.65203593), but this may be due to additional substituents.

4. **Target Molecule: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (Ethyl benzoate):
   - This is an **aromatic ester**, combining a benzene ring with an ester group (**COO** attached to the ring).
   - Comparing to similar structures:
     - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (aliphatic ester) has **0.48479633**.
     - Aromaticity tends to reduce the property value (e.g., nitro-aromatics are negative).
     - However, **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (fully aromatic ether) is **-0.59882538**, but esters are less electron-rich than ethers.

### Prediction:
The presence of the ester group (**COO**) in an aromatic system (benzene) likely places the property value between the aliphatic ester (**0.48479633**) and the fully aromatic ether (**-0.59882538**). Given that esters are less electron-donating than ethers, the value should be closer to the aliphatic ester but slightly reduced due to aromaticity.

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.25** (approximate, as exact interpolation is challenging without a clear linear trend).

However, looking at **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitro-substituted toluene, -0.38484537) and **CCCC(=O)OCC** (aliphatic ester, 0.48479633), the aromatic ester might average these, giving a value closer to **0.0**. 

But in the absence of a direct example, the safest bet is to assign the same value as other simple esters like **CCCC(=O)OCC** (0.48479633), as the aromaticity may not fully offset the ester contribution.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.48479633** (same as aliphatic esters, assuming aromaticity has a minor effect). 

(Note: Without a clear trend or more examples of aromatic esters, this is the most consistent assignment based on the given data.)
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 2.980968238396357
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities with other molecules. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Comparison with similar molecules**:
   - **CI** (iodomethane) has a property value of **4.05772219**, which is high, likely due to the heavy halogen (I) and small size.
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a property value of **0.10795641**, which is lower, likely due to the aromatic system balancing the bromine effect.
   - **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O** (a brominated heterocycle) has a property value of **0.08554858**, again showing that bromine in a complex structure doesn't dominate the property.

2. **Alkyl bromides vs. alkyl iodides**:
   - Bromine is less polarizable and electronegative than iodine, so its contribution to the property will be less than in **CI**.
   - For alkyl halides, longer carbon chains tend to dilute the effect of the halogen. For example:
     - **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol) has a value of **1.40757086**.
     - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-heptene) has a value of **0.94068764**.

3. **Prediction for CCCCCCCBr**:
   - The bromine will contribute positively but less than iodine in **CI**.
   - The long alkyl chain (heptyl) will reduce the overall effect compared to smaller molecules.
   - Given that **CCCCCCC=C** is **0.94068764** and bromine is more polarizable than a double bond but less than iodine, a reasonable estimate is slightly higher than **CCCCCCC=C** but much lower than **CI**.

4. **Final estimate**:
   - A plausible value for **CCCCCCCBr** is around **1.2 to 1.5**, interpolating between **CCCCCCC=C** and **CCCCCCCO**.

Given the examples, the predicted property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is:

**1.35000000** (approximate, based on trends). 

(Note: Without a clear mathematical model or more explicit rules from the given data, this is an educated estimate. The actual value may depend on the specific property being predicted, such as logP, polarizability, or another descriptor.)
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.4075708577080217
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. Simple, non-polar molecules like alkanes (e.g., `CCC`, `CC(C)C`) have higher positive values (~1.5), while polar or complex molecules with nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`), carbonyls (`C=O`), or aromatic systems tend to have negative values. 

The molecule `CO` (carbon monoxide) is a small, polar molecule with a carbonyl group. Comparing it to similar small polar molecules in the dataset:
- `CCCCOC=O` (contains `C=O`) has a value of **0.48479633**.
- `COC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1` (contains `C=O` and aromaticity) has a value of **-0.46676087**.

`CO` is simpler than these examples but shares the polar `C=O` group. Given its small size and lack of additional complexity (e.g., no aromaticity or nitro groups), its value would likely be **positive but lower than alkanes**, closer to small polar molecules like `CCCCOC=O`. 

**Predicted property value for `CO`: ~0.5**.  
(Exact guess: **0.48479633**, matching `CCCCOC=O` due to the `C=O` group and simplicity.)
