SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.4683691482210056
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the trends observed, I can predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (decyl acetate or a similar ester). 

### Observations:
1. **Ester-containing molecules** (e.g., COC(=O)c1cccnc1, CCOC(=O)CC, CCCC(=O)OC) tend to have property values in the range of **-0.6 to -0.8** for smaller esters and **higher values (closer to 0 or above) for longer alkyl chains**.
   - Example: CCCC(=O)OC has a value of **-0.757545** (butyl acetate-like).
   - Example: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (decyl acetate-like) is not explicitly listed, but longer-chain esters like **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (similar to the given C12 example) have higher values (e.g., **0.88928874** for C12 ester).

2. **Chain length effect**: Longer alkyl chains (e.g., CCCC, CCCCCC) tend to increase the property value compared to shorter chains. For example:
   - CCCC: Not listed, but CCCCCC has **-0.56833189**.
   - CCCCCCC(C)O (8 carbons) has **-0.13196848**.
   - CCCCCCCC(C)O (9 carbons) has **0.07849132**.

3. The given molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is a **long-chain ester (likely decyl acetate or similar)**. Given that:
   - The C12 ester (CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC) has a value of **0.88928874**.
   - This molecule is slightly shorter (C10), so its value should be **slightly lower** but still in the **positive range**.

### Prediction:
For **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**, the predicted property value is approximately **0.75**. 

This is based on:
- The trend of increasing values with longer alkyl chains.
- The presence of the ester group, which contributes positively compared to pure hydrocarbons.
- The similarity to the C12 ester example (0.889), but adjusted downward slightly for the shorter chain.

Thus, the predicted value is:  
**0.75** (estimated range: 0.7 to 0.8). 

(Note: If more precise interpolation is needed, the exact value might be closer to **0.78**, but 0.75 is a reasonable estimate given the data.)

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.35655063576705465
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **benzofuran-3-one-like scaffold** (a benzene fused to a lactone-like ring with a carbonyl (=O) and an NH group). This is somewhat similar to heterocyclic systems in the examples (e.g., `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)` or `c1cncnc1`), but with additional complexity.
2. **Substituents**: 
   - A **chlorine (Cl)** substituent on the benzene ring. Chlorine substituents often increase the property value (e.g., compare `ClC=C` (-1.347) vs. `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (0.730)).
   - A **lactam-like moiety (oc(=O)[nH])**, which is polar and may contribute to intermediate values (similar to `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC` (0.585) or `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)` (-1.011)).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The presence of **Cl** and a **fused heterocycle with a carbonyl** suggests the value is likely in the **middle range** (not extremely negative or positive).
- Similar molecules:
  - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (0.730): Multiple Cl atoms increase the value.
  - `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)` (-1.011): A similar cyclic carbonyl structure but with more electronegative atoms (lower value).
  - `Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C` (0.160): A heterocycle with Cl and carbonyls, yielding a slightly positive value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the **electron-withdrawing Cl** and the **polar heterocycle**, the value is likely **slightly positive but modest**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.25**  

This is based on:
- The Cl substituent pushing the value higher (compared to non-Cl analogs).
- The heterocycle's similarity to structures with values around 0.1–0.6.
- No extreme functional groups (e.g., long aliphatic chains or highly conjugated systems) to drive the value much higher or lower. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data.)

Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.046566314842155
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - The molecule **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** has a nitro group attached to a heterocyclic ring and a property value of **-0.34747893**.
   - Nitro groups generally introduce polarity and can lower the property value (more negative) due to their electron-withdrawing nature.

2. **Alkyl Groups**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCOCC**, **CCCCCl**) tend to have negative property values (around **-0.5 to -0.7**).
   - Branching (e.g., **CCC(C)CC**) slightly increases the property value compared to linear chains but remains negative.

3. **Combined Nitro + Alkyl**:
   - The molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** has a nitro group attached to a branched alkyl group (isopropyl). 
   - Compared to **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** (property = **-0.34747893**), the absence of a heterocycle and the presence of a simpler alkyl group might make the property slightly more negative.

4. **Other Nitro-Containing Molecules**:
   - No direct examples of simple nitroalkanes are given, but the trend suggests nitro groups reduce the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the nitro group's electron-withdrawing effect and the branched alkyl group's modest contribution, the property value for **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is likely in the range of **-0.4 to -0.6**. 

A reasonable estimate, considering the closest analog (**Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** with **-0.34747893**) and the simpler alkyl structure, would be:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

(Note: Without a direct example of a simple nitroalkane, this is an educated interpolation based on the given data.)

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 2.357594797278652
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Observations:
1. **Steroid-like structure**: The molecule has a complex polycyclic framework resembling steroids or terpenes (e.g., **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C**, which has a property value of **2.24760288**). These structures tend to have high property values due to their rigidity and functionalization.
2. **Functional groups**:
   - **Ketone (C=O)**: Present in the ring system and as a terminal group (C(=O)CO). Ketones generally increase the property value (e.g., **CC(=O)C(C)(C)C** has a higher value than simpler alkanes).
   - **Hydroxyl (OH)**: The presence of an alcohol group (CC(O)) may slightly increase the value.
   - **Branched/cyclic alkanes**: The core structure is highly branched and cyclic, contributing to a higher value (similar to the steroid example).

3. **Comparison to similar molecules**:
   - The steroid-like molecule **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** has a value of **2.24760288**.
   - The given molecule is even more functionalized (with an additional OH and C(=O)CO group), which would likely increase the property further.

### Prediction:
Given the structural complexity and functional groups, the property value should be **higher than 2.24760288**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: ~2.45**  

This accounts for the additional polar groups (OH and C(=O)CO) enhancing the property beyond the steroid-like reference.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.8014793809736289
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substitutions and one with a chlorine substitution). 
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a property of -0.551, and **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** has -0.1608. Aromatic rings with halogens tend to have negative values unless other functional groups dominate.
2. **Amide Groups**: The molecule has two amide linkages (**C(=O)NC(=O)N**). 
   - Example: **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** has -0.401, and **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** has -0.741. Amides generally contribute to negative property values.
3. **Halogen Substitutions**: Fluorine and chlorine substitutions are present. 
   - Example: **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** has -0.646, and **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has -0.551. Halogens tend to lower the property value.
4. **Polar Functional Groups**: The amides and halogens increase polarity, which correlates with lower property values in the examples.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The molecule resembles a combination of **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (-0.401) and **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (-0.551), but with additional fluorine substitutions and a more complex amide linker.
- The presence of two amide groups and multiple halogens suggests a stronger negative contribution than simpler halogenated aromatics.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above, the property value is likely in the range of **-0.5 to -0.7**. A reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.62**  

This accounts for the combined effects of the aromatic rings, halogens, and amide groups, aligning with the trends observed in the examples.

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.5801297795600221
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropoxypropane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends based on molecular features such as functional groups, branching, and polarity.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ether Groups (R-O-R):**
   - **CCOC(=O)CC** (ethyl propanoate, not a pure ether but contains -O-): -0.757545  
   - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (triethyl phosphate, contains P-O bonds): 0.3846395  
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (sorbitol, polyol with multiple -OH groups): -0.32944566  
   Ethers tend to have moderately negative values unless combined with other polar or bulky groups.

2. **Branching and Chain Length:**
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (branched alcohol): -0.47324807  
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched hydrocarbon): -0.14644896  
   Branching tends to reduce the property value slightly compared to linear analogs.

3. **Hydrocarbons and Simple Alcohols:**
   - **CCCC(C)CO** (branched alcohol): -0.56708267  
   - **CCCCCO** (linear alcohol): -0.73286052  
   Longer chains or more branching reduce the property value further.

### Analysis of **CCCOC(C)C**:
- It is a branched ether with a propyl group (**CCC-**) and an isopropyl group (**-OC(C)C**).  
- Ethers in the examples with simple alkyl groups (e.g., **CCOC(=O)CC**) have negative values.  
- Branching (as in **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**) further reduces the value.  
- No strongly polar or aromatic groups are present to increase the value.  

### Predicted Property:
Given the trends, **CCCOC(C)C** is expected to have a moderately negative value, similar to other branched ethers/alcohols. A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.55** (closer to the range of branched alcohols like **CCCC(C)CO** (-0.567) but slightly less negative due to the ether linkage).  

### Final Answer:
**-0.55** (approximate predicted value).

Iteration: 7
SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.4309872247172209
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **bromine (Br)** substituent, which is electronegative and often contributes to higher property values when combined with other polar groups (e.g., see `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` with Br-like halogens and a value of 0.5269).
   - It has **two carbonyl groups (C=O)** and an **NH group**, which are polar and can increase the property value (similar to `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` with multiple carbonyls and a value of -0.0129, but here the Br adds more polarity).
   - The **alkyl group (CCC(C))** is nonpolar and may slightly lower the property value.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **halogens (Br/Cl) + polar groups** tend to have property values in the **0.1 to 1.1 range** (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl` at -0.3449, but more complex polar systems like `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` at 0.5269).
   - The presence of **two carbonyls and an NH** is similar to `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)CC=C`, which has a value of 0.1942, but the Br here likely increases the value further.
   - The **bulky alkyl group** may slightly offset the polarity (similar to `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` at -0.1082, but this molecule has more polar features).

3. **Hybrid Structure**:
   - This molecule is a mix of polar (Br, C=O, NH) and nonpolar (alkyl) features, but the polar effects dominate. The closest analog is likely `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3` (0.3133) or `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` (0.5269), but with slightly higher polarity due to the additional carbonyl.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of polar and nonpolar features, the property value is likely in the **0.4 to 0.6 range**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.48**  

This aligns with the trend where molecules with multiple polar groups (C=O, NH, Br) and moderate size tend to fall in this range. The exact value could vary slightly, but 0.48 is a chemically plausible prediction based on the examples.

Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.0812632521679324
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the structure of the new molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), we can predict its property value by considering the following trends:

1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have property values around **0.0 to 0.5**, depending on substituents. 
   - Larger conjugated systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatics) increase the value (e.g., **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** has a high value of **1.76772471**).

2. **Biphenyl Structure**:
   - The molecule consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, allowing some conjugation but not as extensive as fused polycyclic systems.
   - Similar examples:
     - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a phenanthrene-like structure) has a value of **0.9121248**.
     - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (a large fused system) has **1.76772471**.
   - Biphenyl is less conjugated than fused systems but more than a single benzene ring.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The value for biphenyl should be **higher than a single benzene derivative** (e.g., **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** at **0.40477282**) but **lower than fused polycyclic systems**.
   - A reasonable estimate is around **0.6–0.8**.

Given the data, the predicted property value for **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** is:

**0.712** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, polarizability, etc.—this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.6771073948839633
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCS** (butyl mercaptan), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., **CCCCCC(C)C**) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.208). 
   - Branched alkanes (e.g., **CC(C)(C)C**) are more negative (e.g., -0.506). 
   - Unsaturation (e.g., **CCCC(=C)C**) leads to more negative values (-0.778).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., -OH, -O-)**: Generally decrease the property value (e.g., **CC(O)C(C)(C)C** = -0.690, **Oc1ccccc1O** = -0.837).
   - **Nitrogen-containing groups (e.g., -NH2, -NO2)**: Can increase or decrease depending on context (e.g., **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** = -0.668, but **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** = 0.361).
   - **Sulfur-containing groups**:
     - Thiols (**-SH**) or thioethers (**-S-**) are not explicitly in the examples, but sulfur in other contexts (e.g., **S(=O)(=O)**, **SC**) often increases the property value (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O** = 1.482).
     - Aromatic sulfur (e.g., **c1ccc2ccccc2c1** = -0.361) is less impactful.

3. **Polarity and Size**:
   - Larger, more polarizable molecules (e.g., polyhalogenated or polycyclic) tend to have higher property values (e.g., **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** = 1.150).
   - Small, nonpolar molecules have lower values.

### Analysis of **CCCCS**:
- **Structure**: A simple aliphatic thiol (butyl mercaptan). 
- **Comparison**:
  - Similar to alkanes but with a sulfur atom replacing a carbon/hydrogen. 
  - Sulfur is more polarizable than carbon but less than oxygen/nitrogen in these examples.
  - No aromaticity or complex functional groups.
- **Expected Property Value**:
  - Alkanes like **CCCCCC(C)C** have values around -0.2.
  - Sulfur's presence might slightly increase the value compared to pure alkanes but not as much as oxygen/nitrogen. 
  - Likely in the range of **-0.1 to 0.1**.

### Prediction:
Given the trends, **CCCCS** is expected to have a property value slightly higher than a pure alkane but still modest. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.05** (close to neutral, slightly negative due to the alkane backbone). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data's apparent trends.)

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.4352254269787946
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with **hydroxyl groups (-OH)** tend to have moderately negative property values (e.g., `CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O` has a value of **0.22118529**, while `CCCC(C)(O)CC` has **-0.38703611**).
   - **Non-polar hydrocarbons** (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)C`) have negative values (e.g., **-0.14644896** for `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C`).
   - **Halogenated compounds** (Cl, Br) often have negative values unless combined with other complex features (e.g., `ClC(Cl)Cl` has **-0.9683118**).

2. **Branching and Size**:
   - More branched alkanes tend to have slightly less negative values than linear ones (e.g., `CC(C)C` vs. `CCC`).
   - The presence of **oxygen (ether or alcohol)** can increase the value compared to pure hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCCCOC` has **-0.78307806**, while `CCCC/C=C/C` has **-0.52126251**).

3. **Specific Case for CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
   - This is a **branched alcohol** with a **tertiary carbon** and a **hydroxyl group**.
   - Similar molecules:
     - `CCCC(C)(O)CC` has **-0.38703611** (branched alcohol, no tertiary carbon adjacent to -OH).
     - `CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O` has **0.22118529** (cyclic, but with -OH).
     - `CC(C)CC(C)O` has **-0.61356697** (less branched alcohol).

### Prediction:
Given that **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is a branched alcohol with a tertiary carbon and a hydroxyl group, its value is likely between **-0.4 and -0.6**, closer to `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (**-0.387**) but slightly more negative due to the tertiary branching.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.45** (estimated based on structural similarity to examples). 

(Note: Without a clear linear regression or quantitative structure-property relationship, this is an approximate interpolation from the given data.)

Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.18901153844896226
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is **methyl-dibenzo[a,e]cyclooctene** (or a methyl-substituted polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon). It consists of:
- A central 8-membered ring fused to two benzene rings (dibenzo structure).
- A methyl group (**-CH3**) attached to one of the aromatic rings.

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple benzene (**c1ccccc1**) has a property value of **-0.953**.
   - Adding substituents (e.g., methyl groups) tends to increase the property value (less negative):
     - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene) is not explicitly given, but **Cc1cccc(C)c1C** (xylene) has **-0.430**.
     - **Cc1ccc(C)c1** (another xylene) has **-0.607**.
   - Polycyclic aromatics (e.g., naphthalene-like structures) tend to have higher values than benzene:
     - **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (methylnaphthalene) is not given, but **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (methyl-substituted biphenyl-like) has **-0.011**.

2. **Methyl Substitution**:
   - Methyl groups generally increase the property value (reduce negativity). For example:
     - **Cc1cccc(C)c1C**: **-0.430** (two methyl groups).
     - **Cc1ccc(C)cc1**: **-0.607** (one methyl group).

3. **Fused Ring Systems**:
   - Fused rings (e.g., **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**) typically have higher values than single-ring systems due to increased conjugation and steric effects.
   - Compare to **c1ccccc1** (**-0.953**) vs. **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (likely less negative).

### Prediction:
Given the structure:
- It is a methyl-substituted dibenzo system (more complex than naphthalene but less than some of the highly substituted polycyclics in the examples).
- The methyl group will increase the value compared to the unsubstituted parent.
- Similar molecules in the examples:
  - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12**: **-0.011** (methyl-substituted biphenyl-like).
  - **c1ccc2ccccc2c1** (unsubstituted dibenzo) would likely be slightly higher than benzene (**-0.953**), perhaps around **-0.5** to **-0.3**.
  - Adding a methyl group would push the value higher (less negative), likely to around **-0.1 to 0.2**.

### Final Estimate:
Considering the above, a reasonable prediction for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is:  
**-0.15** (slightly negative but closer to neutral due to the methyl group and fused ring system).

However, looking more closely at the examples, **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (a similar but more substituted structure) has **-0.011**, so the less substituted **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** might be slightly lower (more negative).  

Thus, a refined prediction is:  
**-0.25**.  

But given the trend, it could also be closer to **-0.10**.  

Given the uncertainty, I'll average these estimates and predict:  
**-0.18**.  

However, to align more closely with the examples, I'll round to:  
**-0.20**.  

### Final Answer:  
**Predicted property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1: -0.20**

### Key Observations:
- The presence of the **hydantoin core** suggests a moderately polar, rigid structure, which typically contributes to intermediate property values (neither very high nor very low).  
- The **bulkier substituent (C(C)CCC)** introduces additional hydrophobicity and steric bulk compared to the methyl group in the example. This would likely **increase the property value slightly** (less negative or more positive) due to increased lipophilicity.  
- The **allyl group (CC=C)** is retained, which does not drastically alter the property.  

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
1. **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C**: **-0.20288578**  
   (smaller substituent)  
2. **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**:  
   - The bulkier substituent (C(C)CCC) should increase the property value slightly (less negative).  

### Predicted Property:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C** should be **slightly higher (less negative)** than **-0.20288578**, likely in the range of **-0.10 to 0.10**.  

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: -0.15**  

### Justification:
- The bulkier substituent increases lipophilicity, offsetting some of the negative contribution from the polar hydantoin core.  
- The allyl group's influence remains similar to the example.  
- No strongly polar or charged groups are introduced to push the value significantly higher or lower.  

Thus, **-0.15** is a plausible prediction based on the given data.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6468684335835525
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene) by analyzing trends in the data. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Data:
1. **Simple Hydrocarbons**: 
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): -0.77879168  
   - **CCC=C** (butene): -1.15366696  
   - **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane): -0.74268249  
   These values suggest that simple aliphatic hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values, with unsaturation (double bonds) further decreasing the value.

2. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (a polyaromatic hydrocarbon): 1.14138211  
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3c4ccccc4ccc23** (another polyaromatic): 0.82569241  
   Aromaticity tends to increase the property value, especially with multiple fused rings.

3. **Substituted Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (chloro-iodobenzene): -0.25608038  
   - **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene): -0.13542704  
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (methoxyphenol): -0.6739339  
   Substitutions on benzene rings can either increase or decrease the property value, with halogens and alkyl groups showing modest effects.

4. **Fluorinated Compounds**:
   - No direct examples of fluorinated aromatics are provided, but **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (dichlorobenzene) has a value of -0.25608038. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, and **CF3** is a strongly electron-withdrawing group.

5. **Trifluoromethylbenzene (FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1)**:
   - The **CF3** group is highly electronegative and would likely decrease electron density in the aromatic ring. Comparing to chloro- and alkyl-substituted benzenes, we might expect a slightly negative value but not as low as simple aliphatic hydrocarbons.

### Prediction:
Given the trends, **trifluoromethylbenzene** would likely have a property value in the range of **-0.3 to -0.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.42**  

This is based on:
- The electron-withdrawing nature of **CF3** reducing the property value compared to unsubstituted aromatics.
- Similar halogenated aromatics (e.g., chloro-iodobenzene at -0.256) suggesting a modest negative effect.
- No strong functional groups (like carbonyls or hydroxyls) that would significantly alter the value. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

Iteration: 14
SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.2956619010885145
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**: 
   - Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (**-OH**) tend to have property values in the range of **-0.3 to -0.8**. For example:
     - `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (sorbitol-like) has a value of **-0.32944566**.
     - `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (catechol) has a value of **-0.84009137**.
   - The presence of multiple **-OH** groups increases polarity but does not necessarily lead to very high or low values unless combined with other features (e.g., aromaticity, conjugation, or charged groups).

2. **Sugar-like Structures**:
   - The molecule in question is a sugar derivative (a hexose-like structure, e.g., glucose or mannitol analog). 
   - Such structures typically have property values slightly more negative than aliphatic alcohols due to their cyclic polyol nature but not as extreme as small polar molecules like carboxylic acids or amines.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (linear polyol) has a value of **-0.32944566**.
   - Cyclic polyols (like the given molecule) often have slightly more negative values due to reduced flexibility and increased intramolecular hydrogen bonding, which may slightly lower the property value.

4. **No Aromaticity or Charged Groups**:
   - The molecule lacks aromatic rings, charged groups, or conjugated systems, which would otherwise push the value higher (e.g., >1.0 for many aromatic or conjugated polar molecules).

### Prediction:
Given the cyclic polyol structure with **five hydroxyl groups**, the property value is expected to be slightly more negative than the linear polyol example but still in the same general range. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**

### Rationale:
- The cyclic structure and high density of **-OH** groups suggest a value more negative than `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (**-0.329**) but less extreme than `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (**-0.840**).
- The value **-0.45** balances these trends while accounting for the cyclic constraint.

Thus, the predicted property value for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is **-0.45**.

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 2.64206661304481
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, polar groups, and halogen substitutions. The molecule in question is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural features:
1. **Multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)**: These are polar and can increase the property value (e.g., see molecules with C=O in the examples).
2. **Steroid-like polycyclic structure**: The molecule has a complex fused ring system similar to steroids or terpenes. Examples with such structures (e.g., `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` with a property of **2.54721826**) suggest high values due to their size and rigidity.
3. **Hydroxyl groups (O)**: These add polarity and can moderately increase the property (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` has a value of **-0.32944566**, but here the rings dominate).
4. **Conjugated double bonds (C=CC=O)**: These can contribute to higher values due to electronic effects.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` has a value of **2.54721826** and shares the polycyclic + carbonyl features.
- `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` has a value of **2.09499321**, also a polycyclic + carbonyl structure but slightly less complex.

The molecule here is even more complex due to:
   - Additional carbonyl (C=O) in the side chain (`CC(=O)OCC(=O)`).
   - Extra hydroxyl group (`C3(O)`).
   - Conjugated double bond (`C=CC=O`).

### Predicted property value:
Given the increased complexity and additional polar groups compared to the most similar examples, the predicted value would be **higher than 2.54721826**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value = 2.85**  

This accounts for the additional contributions from the extra carbonyl and hydroxyl groups while staying within the trend observed in the examples.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 2.0553356712667368
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - The molecule contains a **ketone (C=O)** group, which is present in some of the examples (e.g., `CCOC(=O)C` with a value of `-0.99353785`). However, the value varies depending on the rest of the structure.
   - It also has an **alcohol (OH)** group, which appears in examples like `Oc1ccccc1Cl` (`-0.69305448`) and `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (`1.61136569`). The latter is particularly relevant because it is a polycyclic structure with an OH group, similar to our molecule.

2. **Polycyclic Structure**:
   - The molecule is a **steroid-like polycyclic system** (four fused rings), similar to `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (value: `1.61136569`). Such rigid, multi-ring systems with polar groups (OH, C=O) tend to have higher positive values in the given examples.

3. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is large and has both hydrophobic (alkyl) and polar (OH, C=O) regions. Larger molecules with balanced polarity (like steroids) often have values in the range of `1.0` to `2.0` in the examples.

4. **Comparison to Similar Examples**:
   - `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (value: `1.61136569`) is very similar in structure (polycyclic with OH and alkyl groups).
   - `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (value: `1.99356442`) is another large, polar molecule with a high value.
   - The presence of the ketone (C=O) and alcohol (OH) in our molecule suggests a value closer to these examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (value: `1.61136569`) and the presence of additional hydrophobic character (more alkyl groups), the predicted value would be slightly lower but still in the same range. 

**Final Prediction: `1.45`**  
*(This is an estimate based on the examples, likely between 1.3 and 1.6.)*  

### Reasoning:
- The molecule is less polar than `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (which has an aromatic ring contributing to polarity), so the value is slightly reduced.
- The ketone and alcohol groups still dominate, keeping the value positive and moderately high. 

Thus, **the predicted property value is approximately `1.45`**.

Iteration: 17
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.2736743034013984
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH3-CO-NH-)**: Present in the molecule (CC(=O)N-). 
     - Example with acetamide-like group: `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (property = 0.59471788).
   - **Nitro group (-NO2)**: Attached to the benzene ring (N(=O)=O). 
     - Examples with nitro groups: 
       - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (-0.74291872), 
       - `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (-0.5202358), 
       - `O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12` (-0.14913436).
   - **Aromatic ring**: Substituted with both acetamide and nitro groups.

2. **Polarity and Electron Effects**:
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, while the acetamide group is moderately electron-withdrawing (due to the carbonyl). This combination likely increases the polarity of the molecule.
   - The presence of both groups on the benzene ring may lead to some conjugation effects, but the nitro group's strong electron-withdrawal may dominate.

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (methoxy-nitrobenzene) has a property of -0.5202358. Replacing the methoxy (-OCH3) with acetamido (-NHCOCH3) would likely increase the property value because the acetamido group is more polar and bulky than methoxy.
   - `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (a tertiary amide) has a property of 0.59471788, suggesting that amides can push the property toward positive values.
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (nitrobenzene) has a property of -0.74291872, but adding the acetamido group would likely raise this value.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is more polar and complex than nitrobenzene but less bulky than some of the highly positive examples (e.g., those with multiple rings or large substituents). The acetamido and nitro groups together should push the property value into the low positive range. 

Looking at similar molecules:
- `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` (property = 0.57369957) is somewhat analogous (amide + nitro + aromatic), and our molecule is simpler but with similar substituents.
- `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (property = -0.5202358) is a simpler analog, and replacing -OCH3 with -NHCOCH3 would likely increase the value by ~0.5–1.0.

Thus, a reasonable estimate is:
**Predicted property value: 0.25 to 0.60**. 

Given the examples, I would lean toward the middle of this range:
**Final predicted value: 0.45**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend that more polar/complex substituents increase the property value relative to simpler nitro/ether analogs.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 2.801529514480957
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)**: This is a polar and moderately bulky group, which may increase the property value compared to simpler alkyl or aromatic systems.
2. **Thiocarbamate linkage (SC)**: The sulfur atom here adds some polarity and bulk.
3. **Fused heterocycle (n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12)**: 
   - Contains a **chlorine substituent (Cl)**, which is electronegative and often decreases the property value slightly (as seen in examples like Clc1cccc2ccccc12, -0.15831397).
   - The **lactam (c(=O)) and furan (oc2)** rings add polarity and hydrogen-bonding capability, which may increase the property value.
   - The fused aromatic system (benzofuran-like) with a heteroatom is somewhat similar to some of the more complex examples (e.g., COC(=O)Nc2nc1ccc(cc1[nH]2)C(=O)c3ccccc3, 0.9900548).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule is **more complex** than simple aromatics or aliphatics but less complex than steroids or large polycyclic systems (e.g., C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21, 3.62685837).
- It has **polar groups (P=O, C=O, S, Cl)** and **aromaticity**, which tend to balance the property value.
- The presence of **Cl** and **S** suggests a slight decrease compared to similar-sized molecules without these groups (e.g., Clc1cccc2ccccc12, -0.15831397 vs. c1c(O)C2C(=O)C3cc(O)ccC3OC2cc1(OC), 0.74927363).

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the balance of polar groups, aromaticity, and heteroatoms, the property value is likely in the **moderately positive range**, similar to other complex heterocycles with polar substituents. 

From the examples:
- **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (1.30083849) is somewhat comparable due to the sulfur and aromaticity.
- **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2** (0.32586144) is lower due to less polarity.

Given the additional complexity of the phosphorothioate group and the fused heterocycle, the predicted value is likely **between 0.7 and 1.2**. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 1.050** (approximate, based on structural similarity to the examples). 

This is an educated guess given the lack of explicit rules or a model, but it aligns with the trends observed in the provided data.

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.8816780710945781
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - Simple alcohols like **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol) and **CC(C)CO** (tert-butanol) tend to have negative property values, especially if they are branched or have fewer carbon atoms.
   - Example: **CCC** (propane) has a value of **-1.19971127**, while **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol) has **-1.00399922**.
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** (tert-butanol) is even more branched, which may slightly increase the property value compared to linear or less branched alcohols.

2. **Branching Effect**:
   - Branching generally increases the property value (makes it less negative). For example:
     - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol): **-1.00399922**
     - **CC(C)(C)CO** (tert-butanol) is more branched, so we expect a slightly higher (less negative) value.

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol): **-1.00399922**
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** (tert-butanol) has an additional methyl group, which further increases steric bulk and may raise the property value slightly.

### Prediction:
Given the trends, **CC(C)(C)CO** (tert-butanol) should have a property value slightly higher (less negative) than **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol). 

A reasonable estimate would be around **-0.85** to **-0.90**. 

### Final Predicted Value:
**-0.88** (This is an educated guess based on the branching trend and similarity to other alcohols in the dataset.) 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is a generalized interpretation. If the property is something like **logP**, the prediction aligns with the trend that more branching reduces hydrophobicity slightly.)

Iteration: 20
SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -0.639521081210457
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule is a purine-like heterocycle with:
   - A carbonyl group (C=O) at position 1.
   - Two NH groups (imino hydrogens) at positions 1 and 7.
   - Multiple nitrogen atoms in the aromatic ring (imidazole and pyrimidine-like rings).

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: The presence of C=O and NH groups suggests significant polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity, which often correlates with intermediate property values (neither highly negative nor highly positive).

3. **Aromaticity**: The molecule is fully conjugated and aromatic, similar to purine derivatives, which can stabilize the structure and influence the property.

### Comparison with Given Examples:
- **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (property: -0.866): This is a fluorinated pyrimidine with similar C=O and NH groups but smaller and more electronegative (F substituent). The property is quite negative.
- **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1** (property: -0.911): Another small heterocycle with C=O and NH, also highly negative.
- **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property: -0.374): A methoxy-substituted purine-like system, less negative due to the ether group.
- **Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23** (property: 0.249): A fused heterocycle with thiophene and triazole, slightly positive.

Our molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** is larger than the first two examples but lacks electronegative substituents (like F or Cl). It is more similar to **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** but without the methoxy group, which would reduce electron density. The additional NH groups may increase polarity but not as drastically as fluorine.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of polarity (from C=O and NH) and aromatic stabilization, the property is likely **slightly negative but less so than the fluorinated examples**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property: -0.45**  

This aligns with the trend where:
- Small, highly electronegative heterocycles have more negative values (e.g., -0.866, -0.911).
- Larger or less electronegative heterocycles have less negative values (e.g., -0.374 for the methoxy-purine).
- Our molecule falls in between, closer to -0.374 but slightly more negative due to the NH groups. 

Thus, **-0.45** is a plausible prediction.

Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -1.0113102921632682
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends based on molecular features such as functional groups, size, and polarity.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Small, polar molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups** (e.g., alcohols, esters, ethers) tend to have negative or modestly positive property values. Examples:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): **-1.20026442**
   - **CCOC=C** (ethoxyethene): **-1.10478595**
   - **CCCOC(C)C** (ethyl isopropyl ether): **-0.58012978**
   - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (triethyl phosphate): **0.3846395**

2. **Esters** (like methyl acetate, **CC(C)OC=O**) are moderately polar and smaller in size. Their property values tend to be slightly negative or near zero, depending on branching and additional functional groups. For example:
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a complex steroid ester): **2.46909208** (high due to size/rigidity).
   - Simpler esters or carbonyl-containing molecules like **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1** (fluoroacetamide): **-0.44194656**.

3. **Branching** (e.g., **CC(C)O** vs. **CCO**) tends to lower the property value slightly (more negative).

### Prediction for **CC(C)OC=O**:
- Methyl acetate is a small ester with branching (isopropyl group). 
- It is more polar than ethers but less polar than alcohols like isopropanol.
- Based on the examples, small esters typically fall in the range of **-0.5 to 0.0**.
- The branching (isopropyl) may push the value slightly more negative.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, the property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is likely around **-0.6 to -0.4**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.55**  

*(This aligns with similar-sized polar molecules like ethyl isopropyl ether (-0.58) and fluoroacetamide (-0.44), accounting for the ester's intermediate polarity.)*

SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 0.320346291385225
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Group**: The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl rings attached to the nitrogen atoms (N-aryl urea). The structure is symmetric, with two aniline (Ph-NH) groups connected to a carbonyl (C=O) group.
   - **Urea-like moiety**: Similar to **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = 0.07463613), but with aromatic rings instead of aliphatic rings.
   - **Aromatic rings**: Two phenyl rings are present, similar to many examples (e.g., **c1ccncc1** with property = -1.0163934, but this is a pyridine ring).

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - The urea group (**N-C(=O)-N**) is highly polar and can form hydrogen bonds, which typically reduces the property value (more negative). However, the aromatic rings add hydrophobicity, which may offset this.

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** (property = -0.07155851): This is a carbamate with aromatic rings. The urea in our molecule is more polar, but the symmetry might balance it.
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = 0.07463613): This is a cyclic urea with aliphatic groups. Our molecule has aromatic rings, which are less polar than aliphatic amines but still contribute to conjugation.

4. **Symmetry and Conjugation**:
   - The symmetric structure and extended conjugation (phenyl rings + urea) might slightly increase the property value compared to simpler ureas or amides.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above analysis, the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is expected to have a property value **close to 0**, similar to other symmetric, polar-aromatic structures. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.05**  

This is based on:
- The urea group's polarity (tending toward negative values).
- The aromatic rings' hydrophobicity and conjugation (pushing toward less negative or slightly positive values).
- Symmetry (balancing effects).  

The value is slightly positive due to the symmetry and conjugation, similar to **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (0.07463613).

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 0.1462185789908266
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (which is fluorene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with three fused rings: two benzene rings fused to a central cyclopentadiene ring), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple benzene derivatives (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative (e.g., `CNc1ccccc1` = -0.675, `CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1` = -0.484).
   - Larger conjugated systems (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1`, a polycyclic aromatic) have higher values (0.821).
   - Fluorene (`C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13`) is intermediate in size between benzene and larger polycyclic aromatics.

2. **Substituents**: 
   - Electronegative or polar substituents (e.g., halogens, nitro groups) often increase the property value slightly (e.g., `Brc1ccccc1` = -0.577 vs. `Fc1cccc(F)c1` = -0.869).
   - Nonpolar aliphatic chains decrease the value (e.g., `CCCc1ccccc1` = -0.334).

3. **Fluorene-Like Structures**: 
   - The molecule `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (a larger polycyclic aromatic) has a value of 0.821.
   - Fluorene is smaller but has a similar fused-ring structure, so we expect a value between simple benzenes (~0) and larger polycyclics (~0.8).

### Prediction:
Fluorene's property value is likely **between 0.4 and 0.7**. Given its similarity to smaller polycyclic aromatics and the examples, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.65** (specific value could be refined with more data, but this aligns with the trend). 

(Note: If the property is logP, this would fit fluorene's moderate hydrophobicity.)

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 0.3615842025315878
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **NC(=N)N**: A guanidine-like group (highly polar, basic).
   - **NS(=O)(=O)**: A sulfonamide group (polar, hydrogen-bonding).
   - **Aromatic ring with NH2**: Aniline-like (polar, hydrogen-bonding).

2. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is polar due to multiple nitrogen and sulfur groups.
   - It is moderately sized (not as large as some polycyclic or long-chain examples).

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with sulfonamides (e.g., **CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O**, property = 1.1217) tend to have positive property values.
   - Molecules with aromatic amines (e.g., **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, property = 0.8889) also have positive values.
   - The guanidine-like group may further increase the property value due to its basicity and polarity.

4. **Trends**:
   - Small, nonpolar molecules (e.g., **CC(C)Cl**, **CCC#CCC**) have negative values.
   - Polar/charged groups (e.g., sulfonamides, amines, nitros) correlate with higher positive values.
   - The presence of multiple polar groups suggests a value in the **0.5–1.5 range**.

### Predicted Property:
Given the combination of sulfonamide, aromatic amine, and guanidine-like groups, the molecule is likely to have a **property value around 0.8–1.2**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property = 1.05**  

This aligns with similar polar, nitrogen/sulfur-containing molecules in the dataset.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.9070838399621644
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to estimate the property value.

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**: The molecule has two nitro groups attached to the aromatic ring. From the examples:
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** has a value of **-0.68639326** (one nitro group).
   - **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O** has a value of **1.07510006** (one nitro group with additional complexity).
   Nitro groups tend to increase the property value when combined with other polar or conjugated systems.

2. **Trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)**: This is a strongly electron-withdrawing group. From the examples:
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (halogenated) has a value of **0.32586144**.
   - **Brc1ccccc1** has a value of **-0.57740248**.
   The CF3 group is more electron-withdrawing than halogens and may increase the property value.

3. **Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C))**: This is a flexible, moderately polar group. From the examples:
   - **CCN(CC)c1ccccc1** has a value of **-0.03513371**.
   - **CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23** has a value of **0.87095368** (more conjugated system).
   The amine here is less conjugated but may still contribute positively.

4. **Aromatic system with substitution**: The molecule has a highly substituted aromatic ring with nitro and CF3 groups, which increases polarity and conjugation. Compare to:
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1** (value **0.83824846**).
   - **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O** (value **1.07510006**).

5. **Alkene (CC(C)=C)**: This adds some flexibility but is not a dominant factor.

### Synthesis of Observations:
- The presence of **two nitro groups** and a **CF3 group** will significantly increase the property value compared to simpler nitroaromatics.
- The tertiary amine and conjugated system further contribute to a higher value.
- The molecule is more complex than most in the examples, but similar to **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O** (value **1.07510006**), which also has a nitro group and extended conjugation.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing effects and conjugation, the value is likely higher than **1.07510006** but not as high as some of the large steroids (e.g., ~2.8). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 1.25** (specific: **1.25000000**)  

This balances the contributions of the nitro groups, CF3, and amine while considering similar examples.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -1.0113102921632682
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O**:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Ester-like group (OC=O)**: The molecule has a formate ester group (R-O-CHO), which is polar and can influence the property value.
   - **Branched alkyl group (CC(C))**: A small branched hydrocarbon chain (isopropyl group) attached to the oxygen.

2. **Similar Molecules in the Dataset**:
   - **CC(C)CCOC=O** (property: -0.60671347): This is a branched ester with a longer alkyl chain (4 carbons total). The property is moderately negative.
   - **CC(=O)N** (property: -1.3770928): This is an amide (highly polar), but the ester in **CC(C)OC=O** is less polar than an amide.
   - **CCOC(=O)C** (property: -0.36215847): This is an ethyl ester (less branched than **CC(C)OC=O**), with a slightly less negative value.
   - **CCCC=O** (property: -1.01583517): This is an aldehyde (no ester oxygen), which is more negative than esters.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Esters (R-OC=O) tend to have moderately negative property values, but less negative than aldehydes or amides.
   - Branching (e.g., isopropyl) slightly reduces the polarity compared to linear chains, which may increase the property value (make it less negative).
   - The small size of **CC(C)OC=O** (only 4 carbons total) suggests a stronger influence of the polar ester group.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarities to **CC(C)CCOC=O** (-0.60671347) but with a shorter and more branched structure, the property value for **CC(C)OC=O** should be slightly less negative (closer to zero) due to reduced polarity from branching. However, it is still an ester, so it won't be as high as non-polar hydrocarbons.

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.50 and -0.60**. Splitting the difference, I predict:

**Predicted property value: -0.55**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or experimental data would be needed.)

Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.5508872788980608
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends based on molecular features:

### Key Observations:
1. **Hydrophobicity/LogP Trends**:
   - The property values appear to correlate with **logP (partition coefficient)**, where higher values indicate greater lipophilicity (hydrophobicity), and lower values indicate greater hydrophilicity.
   - **Polar groups (e.g., -OH, -O-, -COOH, -NO2)** decrease the property value (more negative).
   - **Nonpolar groups (e.g., alkyl chains, halogens, aromatic rings)** increase the property value (more positive).

2. **Structure of the Target Molecule**:
   - **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a benzene ring).
   - The hydroxyl group (-OH) is polar and will decrease the property value.
   - The methyl groups (-CH3) are nonpolar and will increase the property value.

3. **Similar Examples**:
   - **COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1** (multiple -OH groups): **-0.367**
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol): **-0.897**
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1** (dimethylbenzene): **-0.369**
   - **Cc1ccccc1C** (ethylbenzene): **-0.369**

   The target molecule has **one -OH and two -CH3 groups**, so its value should be between phenol (-0.897) and dimethylbenzene (-0.369), but closer to dimethylbenzene due to the balancing effect of the methyl groups.

4. **Estimated Value**:
   - Phenol: **-0.897**
   - Dimethylbenzene: **-0.369**
   - The hydroxyl group's effect is partially offset by the two methyl groups, so the value should be slightly higher than phenol but still negative.
   - A reasonable estimate is **~-0.45 to -0.55**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends and similar examples, the predicted property value for **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** is:

**-0.52**

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 1.7332116780370106
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: 
   - Molecules with this group (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) have **high positive property values (1.43–1.73)**. 
   - The presence of `P(=S)` seems to correlate with increased property values, especially when combined with aromatic rings and halogens.

2. **Aromatic Ring Substitution**:
   - The molecule has a substituted phenyl ring (`Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1`). 
   - Substitutions like `SC` (thioether) and `C` (methyl) are present. 
   - From the examples, aromatic rings with electron-donating groups (e.g., `OCH3`, `CH3`) or sulfur-containing groups tend to have **moderate to high positive values** when combined with `P(=S)`.

3. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **1.43031352**. 
   - Replacing the chlorines with `SC` (thioether) and `CH3` (methyl) might slightly alter the property. 
   - Thioether (`SC`) is less electron-withdrawing than chlorine, which could **increase the property value slightly** compared to the chlorinated analog.

4. **Other Features**:
   - The molecule has no highly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `NO2`, `CF3`), which would lower the value. 
   - The `P(=S)` group dominates the property trend.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong influence of `P(=S)` and the aromatic substitutions, the value is likely **close to the phosphorothioate examples**. The presence of `SC` and `CH3` (less electron-withdrawing than halogens) may push the value slightly higher than the chlorinated analog (1.43). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**1.55 ± 0.10** (likely between 1.45 and 1.65).

### Final Answer:
**1.55** (approximate prediction based on structural analogs).

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.9340300778473065
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to correlate with molecular complexity, halogenation (especially chlorine substitution), aromaticity, and functional groups. 

The molecule in question is highly chlorinated and has a biphenyl-like structure with multiple chlorine substitutions:  
**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**  

Key observations from similar molecules in the dataset:  
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic systems** tend to have higher property values (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a value of **1.13759242**, and `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has **1.34367315**).  
2. The **biphenyl core with chlorine substitutions** increases the value further (e.g., the latter example above).  
3. The given molecule has **even more chlorines** (6 in total) and a fused aromatic system, which should push the value higher than the examples above.  

### Predicted Property Value:  
Given the trend, I estimate the value for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** to be approximately **1.45–1.55**.  

A refined prediction based on the closest analogs would be:  
**~1.48**  

This accounts for the additional chlorine substitutions compared to the examples with values of 1.34 and 1.14.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -1.0000820098527237
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Alkenes**: 
   - **CCC** (propane): -1.19971127  
   - **CC** (ethane): -1.37406188  
   - **CC(=C)C** (isobutene): -1.22524433  
   These simple hydrocarbons have negative property values, typically around -1.0 to -1.4.

2. **Nitro Compounds**:
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (dicyanobenzene): -0.62711318  
   - **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** (trinitrobenzene): -0.3224716  
   Nitro groups (NO2) tend to increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons, but the effect depends on the rest of the structure.

3. **Nitroalkanes**:
   - The molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** is **1-nitropropane**, a simple nitroalkane.  
   - From the examples, nitro groups attached to small aliphatic chains (like propane) are not explicitly given, but we can infer:
     - Nitro groups increase the property value compared to the parent hydrocarbon (propane: -1.19971127).  
     - The increase is likely modest, placing the value between -0.5 and 0.0.

4. **Other Functional Groups**:
   - **OCC(NC(=O)C(Cl)Cl)C(O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: 0.88020984 (complex nitroaromatic)  
   - **Nc1ccccc1O**: -0.81018444 (simple aromatic with -NH2 and -OH)  
   Nitro groups in more complex or aromatic structures tend to have higher values, but for simple aliphatic nitro compounds, the effect is less pronounced.

### Prediction for CCCN(=O)=O:
- The parent hydrocarbon (propane) has a value of -1.19971127.  
- Adding a nitro group will increase the value, likely to the range of -0.6 to -0.3.  
- Comparing to **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (-0.62711318, which has two nitrile groups) and **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** (-0.3224716, which has three nitro groups), a single nitro group on a small alkane chain would likely have a value slightly lower than these.  

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CCCN(=O)=O** is approximately **-0.65**.  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.5354511716334298
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends based on molecular features that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogen-Substituted Aromatic Rings**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: Property = -0.37635852  
     (Chlorine and Bromine on benzene)
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: Property = 0.72794935  
     (Multiple chlorines on biphenyl)
   - **COc1cccc(Cl)c1**: Property = -0.5319338  
     (Chlorine and methoxy on benzene)
   - **COc1ccccc1Cl**: Property = -0.52941541  
     (Chlorine and methoxy on benzene)
   - **BrC(Br)Br**: Property = -0.36314761  
     (Brominated aliphatic)

   Halogens (Cl, Br) on aromatic rings tend to give property values in the range of **-0.5 to -0.3** for mono-substituted cases, with more halogens increasing the value slightly.

2. **Fluorine-Substituted Aromatic Rings**:
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1**: Property = -0.44194656  
     (Fluorine on benzene with amide substituent)
   - Fluorine is slightly more electronegative than Cl/Br, but the effect on the property seems similar.

3. **Bromine vs. Chlorine**:
   - Bromine tends to have a slightly less negative impact than chlorine (compare **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** = -0.376 vs. **Clc1ccc(Cl)c1** would likely be similar or slightly more negative).

4. **Combined Halogens**:
   - **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** has both fluorine and bromine. Fluorine is more electronegative, but bromine is larger and more polarizable. The combined effect might average out similarly to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**.

### Prediction for Fc1cccc(Br)c1:
Given that:
- **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** has a property of **-0.376**,
- Fluorine is slightly more electronegative than chlorine but less polarizable,
- The property for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is likely to be in a similar range but slightly more negative due to fluorine's stronger electron-withdrawing effect.

Thus, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1: -0.40**  

(Note: This is an approximate prediction based on qualitative trends in the data. For precise modeling, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) methods or machine learning would be needed.)

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 0.16812327709161948
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, I will predict the property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a bicyclic structure with a hydroxyl group (OH) and multiple alkyl (methyl) groups. This is somewhat similar to steroids or terpenoid-like structures in the dataset (e.g., **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**, which has a property value of **2.91487848**).
2. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The hydroxyl group (OH) is present, which is also seen in molecules like **CC(C)(C)CO** (property: **-0.88167807**) and **CC1CCCO1** (property: **-0.73848342**). However, these are simpler aliphatic alcohols with lower values.
   - The bicyclic framework with alkyl substitutions is more complex, akin to steroid-like molecules in the dataset (e.g., **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**, property: **2.47412616**).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The molecule lacks highly polar or charged groups (e.g., sulfonamides, carbonyls directly attached to rings) that tend to increase the property value significantly (as seen in some examples with values > 2).
- It also lacks halogens (Cl, Br, F) or aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups, which can modulate the property value.
- The hydroxyl group and alkyl substitutions suggest moderate polarity but not extreme.

### Closest Matches:
1. **CC1CCCO1** (property: **-0.73848342**): Simpler cyclic alcohol, but less bulky.
2. **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2** (property: **2.05476448**): More complex with carbonyl and aromatic systems, but shares some bicyclic features.
3. **CC(C)(C)CO** (property: **-0.88167807**): Simple tertiary alcohol, less complex.

### Prediction:
Given the bicyclic structure with a hydroxyl group and alkyl substitutions, the property value is likely **higher than simple alcohols** but **lower than highly functionalized steroids**. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **0.5 to 1.5**. 

Considering the lack of highly polarizing groups (e.g., carbonyl, halogens) and the steric bulk, I predict a value closer to the lower end of this range.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2: 0.85** (rounded to two decimal places). 

This balances the contributions of the hydroxyl group (which would increase polarity) and the bulky alkyl substitutions (which would decrease it slightly).

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 1.7883022754994176
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` by comparing its structural features to those in the dataset. 

### Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (`P(=S)(OCC)OCC`)**: This functional group appears in the molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O`, which has a property value of **3.14303423**. The presence of this group seems to correlate with higher property values, especially when combined with other complex features.
   
2. **Lactam-like Structure (`N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`)**: This is a phthalimide-like structure (cyclic imide with an aromatic ring), which also appears in the molecule above. This substructure likely contributes to the higher property value due to its rigidity and polarity.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - The molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (property = 3.14303423) has an additional `SC(CCl)` group attached to the phosphorus, which may slightly increase the property value due to increased complexity and electronegativity.
   - The molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` lacks the `SC(CCl)` group but retains the core `P(=S)(OCC)` and phthalimide structures. 

### Prediction:
Given that the target molecule is very similar to the one with a property value of 3.14303423 but lacks the `SC(CCl)` substituent (which likely adds some steric and electronic effects), I would expect its property value to be slightly lower but still in the same high range. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: ~2.9 to 3.0**

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**2.95**

This is based on the assumption that the `SC(CCl)` group contributes ~0.2 to the property value, and its absence reduces the value accordingly. The exact value would depend on the specific property being modeled (e.g., logP, polar surface area, etc.), but this is a plausible interpolation from the given data.

Iteration: 34
SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 0.10344670278809313
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like** core with a **1,2,4-triazole** or **pyrazine** ring (based on the `cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1` fragment). This is a fused heterocyclic system with aromatic character and a carbonyl group (=O), which often increases polarity and may contribute to higher property values in the given dataset.
2. **Substituents**: 
   - Two methyl groups (`C` attached to the nitrogen atoms) – these are moderately hydrophobic but not as impactful as larger alkyl chains.
   - A phenyl ring (`c2ccccc2`) fused to the heterocycle – aromatic systems often contribute positively to the property (e.g., see `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` with a value of **0.826**).
3. **Electron-Withdrawing/Delocalization**: The carbonyl (=O) and nitrogen atoms create electron delocalization, which may increase the property value (similar to other conjugated systems in the dataset).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (value: **0.826**): This has a similar fused aromatic system with a carbonyl and methyl groups. The main difference is the additional phenyl ring in place of one nitrogen in our target molecule.
- **O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23** (value: **0.424**): Another fused heterocycle with a carbonyl and aromatic rings, but less bulky than our target.
- **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (value: **-0.768**): A simple amide with no aromaticity, showing how conjugation/aromaticity elevates the property.

Given the **fused aromatic system + carbonyl + methyl groups**, the property value should be **moderately high**, similar to the first example but slightly lower due to the less extended conjugation (only one phenyl ring directly attached). 

### Predicted Value:
**0.65** (a reasonable estimate between 0.424 and 0.826, accounting for the structural similarities). 

This aligns with the trend where conjugated, aromatic, and carbonyl-containing molecules in the dataset tend to have positive values in the 0.4–1.3 range, while simpler/aliphatic molecules are negative or near zero.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.1261656184078501
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural and functional group trends that correlate with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains (Alkanes/Alkenes):**  
   - **CCC(=C)C** (isobutene): -0.989  
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): -0.779  
   - **CCCCS** (butyl mercaptan): -0.677  
   - Longer/saturated hydrocarbons tend to have negative values (~ -0.5 to -1.0).

2. **Esters (RCOOR'):**  
   - **CCOC(=O)N** (ethyl carbamate): -1.082  
   - **CC(C)OC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate): -0.827  
   - Esters with small alkyl groups tend to have negative values (~ -0.8 to -1.0).  
   - **CCCCC(=O)OCC** is a larger ester (ethyl hexanoate), which might slightly increase the property value compared to smaller esters due to the longer hydrocarbon chain.

3. **Polar Functional Groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -Br):**  
   - Adding halogens or hydroxyl groups often increases the property value (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1I**: -0.254 vs. **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl**: 1.138).  
   - **CCCCCCCI** (iodoheptane): 0.310 (halogen increases value).  

4. **Carbonyl Groups (Ketones/Aldehydes):**  
   - **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(=O)C2** (camphor): 0.106  
   - **O=C1CCC(=O)N1** (succinimide): -0.905  
   - Ketones/aldehydes vary but often hover around 0.0 to -1.0 unless conjugated or in complex systems.

### Prediction for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is an ester with a 6-carbon chain (**CCCCCC**) and an ethoxy group (**OCC**).  
- Compared to smaller esters (e.g., isopropyl acetate: -0.827), the longer alkyl chain might slightly increase the property value (less negative).  
- No halogens or other polar groups are present to significantly raise the value.  
- Likely in the range of **-0.5 to -0.7**.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.65** (a compromise between the typical ester trend and the longer hydrocarbon chain effect).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)*

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.541828004145602
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular weight. 

The molecule in question is **COC(=O)c1ccccc1**, which is methyl benzoate. Structurally, it consists of a benzene ring with an ester group (–COOCH₃). 

Comparing this to similar molecules in the dataset:
- **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) has a property value of **-0.29452359**.
- **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC** (a diester) has a higher value of **2.05029185**, likely due to increased size and functionality.
- **CCOC(=O)c1cncn1C(C)c2ccccc2** (a more complex ester with additional aromatic rings) has a value of **0.72035685**.

Given that methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1) is structurally simpler than ethyl benzoate but very similar, its property value should be close to that of ethyl benzoate but slightly lower due to the shorter alkyl chain (methyl vs. ethyl). 

### Predicted property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1**:  
**~ -0.35**  

This estimate is based on:  
1. The trend that simpler esters with fewer functional groups have lower values.  
2. The presence of the aromatic ring and ester group, which align with the range seen in similar molecules.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an empirical approximation based on structural analogs in the dataset.)
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -1.1076226535009166
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size/complexity. 

The molecule in question is **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), which is a simple linear conjugated diene with no heteroatoms, halogens, or aromatic rings. Comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. **CC/C=C/C** (a simple alkene with a similar structure but less conjugation) has a property value of **-0.9421821**.
2. **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene, which has an aromatic ring) has a value of **-0.69738859**.
3. **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene) has a value of **-0.33382487**.

Since **C=CCC=C** is a conjugated diene but lacks aromaticity or other functional groups, its property value should be between the simple alkene (**-0.942**) and the aromatic-containing molecules (closer to **-0.7**). 

Given the conjugation in 1,3-butadiene, it will likely have a slightly higher (less negative) value than **CC/C=C/C** but lower than **C=Cc1ccccc1**. 

### Predicted property value for **C=CCC=C**:  
**-0.85** (approximate, based on interpolation from similar structures). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated estimate based on the trend in the given data.)

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: -0.3631476074050583
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a high value of **1.34367315**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (pentachlorobiphenyl) has a value of **0.93403008**.
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a value of **0.0138635**.
   - **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (chloronaphthalene) has a value of **-0.16083236**.
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (a halogenated alkane) has a value of **-0.68199896**.

   Halogenation generally increases the property value, but the magnitude depends on the number and type of halogens (Br > Cl > F) and the molecular size.

2. **Small Halogenated Alkanes**:
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (small, mixed halogenated alkane) has a value of **-0.68199896**.
   - **BrC(Br)Br** is a small, fully brominated alkane (tribromomethane), which is more heavily halogenated than the above example but smaller than the polyhalogenated aromatics.

3. **Trend in Halogen Count**:
   - More halogens → higher property value.
   - Bromine contributes more than chlorine or fluorine.

4. **Molecular Size**:
   - Larger molecules (e.g., polycyclic aromatics or long chains) tend to have higher values, but **BrC(Br)Br** is small.

### Prediction for BrC(Br)Br:
- **BrC(Br)Br** is a small molecule with three heavy bromine atoms. 
- Compared to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (value = -0.68199896), **BrC(Br)Br** has more bromines and no fluorines, so its value should be higher.
- However, it is much smaller than the polyhalogenated aromatics (which have values ~0.9–1.3), so its value will be lower than those.
- A reasonable estimate is slightly above the small halogenated alkane **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** but below the aromatic examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **BrC(Br)Br** is approximately:  
**0.25**  

This balances the heavy bromination (pushing the value up) with the small size (limiting the increase). 

---
**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value for **BrC(Br)Br** is **0.25**.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 3.143034230321042
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group contributions. The molecule in question is:

**CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**

Breaking this down:
1. It contains a **phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**, which is polar and often contributes positively to the property (similar to the molecule with **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**, which had a value of **2.78058575**).
2. It has an **aromatic ring (c1ccccc1)** and **amide (C(=O)N)**, which are common in the examples and often contribute moderately.
3. The **chloroalkyl group (C(CCl))** adds some polarity but is less significant than the phosphorothioate.
4. The **ethyl groups (CCO)** are less polar and may slightly reduce the property.

Comparing to similar structures:
- The presence of **P(=S)** and **aromatic + amide** is reminiscent of the molecule with a value of **2.78058575**, but this one has fewer aromatic rings and a simpler structure.
- The molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** had a value of **1.34132186**, and this one is somewhat less polar but has the P(=S) group.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is likely in the range of **1.8 to 2.2**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: 2.0** (rounded for simplicity, as the exact value depends on finer structural nuances). 

If more precision is needed, a value like **1.95** could also be plausible, but based on the examples, **2.0** is a defensible prediction.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 1.30312626736437
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **chlorinated aromatic ring (c1ccc(c(Cl)c1))** connected to a **urea-like fragment (CN(C)C(=O)N-)** and a **heterocyclic oxadiazole-like moiety (n2nc(oc2=O))**. 
2. **Substituents**: 
   - A **tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)** is attached to the heterocycle, which is bulky and hydrophobic.
   - A **chlorine atom (Cl)** on the aromatic ring, which often increases hydrophobicity but may also introduce polarity.
   - A **dimethylamide group (CN(C)C=O)**, which is polar but also has some hydrophobic character due to the methyl groups.
3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **chlorinated aromatic rings** (e.g., Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2, property = 0.3208; Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, property = 0.7329) tend to have moderately positive property values.
   - Molecules with **polar amide/urea groups** (e.g., NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1, property = -0.4010; CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, property = -0.7679) tend to have negative values, but bulky hydrophobic groups can offset this.
   - The **tert-butyl group** and **heterocycle** add hydrophobicity, similar to molecules like CCCC(C)C1(CC)C(=O)NC(=S)NC1=O (property = 0.7569).

### Synthesis of Observations:
- The **chlorinated aromatic ring** and **bulky tert-butyl group** will push the property toward positive values.
- The **polar urea/amide group** will pull it toward negative values, but the overall hydrophobicity of the structure likely dominates.
- The closest analogs are molecules like **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (0.7329)** and **CCCC(C)C1(CC)C(=O)NC(=S)NC1=O (0.7569)**, which have similar combinations of halogens and polar/hydrophobic groups.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of features, the property value is likely **moderately positive**, similar to the above examples. 

**Predicted property value: 0.68** (estimated range: 0.6–0.8). 

This is based on the molecule's structural similarity to compounds with property values in this range, accounting for its hydrophobic and polar substituents.

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 0.6500406559007541
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Halogens (Cl, Br, F)**:
   - Molecules with multiple Cl atoms tend to have property values in the range of **-0.5 to +0.5**, depending on other functional groups.
   - Example:  
     - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` → **0.32586144** (two Cl atoms + aromatic rings)  
     - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` → **-0.08236745** (four Cl atoms + phenol)  

2. **Phenol Groups (-OH attached to benzene)**:
   - Phenols generally lower the property value (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` → **-0.49201053**).  
   - Multiple -OH groups further decrease the value (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)CO` → **-0.82742067**).  

3. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Aromaticity alone does not drastically change the property, but substitution with halogens or polar groups modulates it.  

4. **Ether Linkages (-O-)**:  
   - Ethers (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl`) slightly lower the property compared to non-ether analogs.  

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** has:
- Two phenol groups (each with -OH).  
- Three Cl atoms (one on the first ring, two on the second).  
- An ether linkage (-O-) connecting the two aromatic rings.  

Similar molecules in the dataset:
- `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` → **-0.49201053** (one phenol + two Cl).  
- `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` → **0.32586144** (two Cl + biphenyl).  
- `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` → **-0.08236745** (phenol + four Cl).  

Given the additional phenol group and ether linkage, the property value is expected to be **lower** than `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` but higher than highly polar/aliphatic molecules (e.g., `NC(N)=NC#N` → **-1.26960198**).  

### Predicted Property:
Considering the balance between the electron-withdrawing Cl atoms and the polar -OH groups, the predicted value is approximately:  
**-0.35**  

### Refined Estimate:
- The ether linkage and second phenol group will further decrease the value compared to `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (**-0.492**), but the three Cl atoms will partially offset this.  
- A reasonable prediction is:  
  **-0.40 to -0.45**  

### Final Answer:
**-0.42** (This aligns with the trends observed for similar structures in the dataset.)
==================================================
Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.9421820977970831
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, it appears that the property in question correlates with molecular complexity, polarity, and the presence of specific functional groups or structural features. 

Key observations:
1. Simple alkanes (e.g., `CCCC(C)C`) have negative values around -0.6.
2. Alkenes (e.g., `CC/C=C/C`) have a value of -0.9421821, suggesting that double bonds contribute to more negative values compared to single bonds.
3. The molecule `CC/C=C\C` is the trans isomer of `CC/C=C/C` (which had -0.9421821). Since trans and cis isomers typically have similar but not identical properties (with trans often being slightly less polar due to symmetry), we can expect a value close to -0.94 but slightly less negative due to reduced polarity.

Given this, the predicted property value for `CC/C=C\C` would be slightly higher (less negative) than -0.9421821, likely around **-0.92**.

However, since the examples do not explicitly distinguish between cis/trans isomers, and the difference is often small for such properties, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: -0.93** (slightly less negative than the cis counterpart). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data. If the property is logP or a similar metric, trans-alkenes are typically ~0.1 higher than cis due to reduced polarity.)

Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.7462334396419095
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends based on molecular structure and functional groups.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes**: 
   - **C** (methane): -1.79498146  
   - **CC#C** (propyne): -1.46301265  
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): -1.2270198  
   These show that smaller hydrocarbons with unsaturation (triple bonds) have more negative values.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): -1.20026442  
   - **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol): -0.7473509  
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (methoxyphenol): -0.6739339  
   Oxygenated compounds (alcohols, ethers) tend to have less negative values than pure hydrocarbons but still negative unless other functional groups are present.

3. **Ethers**:
   - No direct example of simple ethers like **CCCOCC**, but **COc1ccccc1O** (methoxyphenol) has an ether linkage and a value of -0.6739339.  
   - Ethers generally have less negative values than alcohols (e.g., **CC(C)O** is -1.20026442 vs. **CCCOCC** likely being less negative).

4. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer chains or branching slightly increase the value (less negative).  
   - **CCCOCC** is a symmetrical ether with 5 carbons, similar in size to **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol, -0.7473509).

### Prediction for **CCCOCC**:
- It is a simple ether with no additional functional groups.  
- Compared to **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol, -0.7473509), the absence of an OH group (replaced by an ether linkage) typically makes the value slightly less negative (closer to zero).  
- Symmetry and lack of polar groups like OH suggest a value between -0.7 and -0.5.  

### Estimated Property Value:
**-0.65** (approximate, based on trends).  

(Note: Without a direct example of **CCCOCC** or a clear regression model, this is an educated guess based on structural similarity to the provided data.)  

Would you like me to refine this further based on additional reasoning?

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 1.012517909600945
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary amide** group (`N(C=O)`), which is polar and can contribute to higher property values (as seen in similar amide-containing molecules in the examples).
   - It has **two aromatic rings** (phenyl groups), one attached to a bulky **tert-butyl-like group** (`C(C)(C)c1ccccc1`) and the other attached to the amide nitrogen. Aromatic rings generally increase the property value unless balanced by other features (e.g., nitro groups, halogens).

2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property = 1.30083849): This has a tertiary amide, aromatic rings, and a heterocycle. The property is moderately high.
   - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = 0.32160174): This has two aromatic rings but no polar amide, so the value is lower.
   - **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23** (property = 1.00146364): This has a tertiary amide and aliphatic rings, giving a value ~1.0.

3. **Bulky Substituents**:
   - The **tert-butyl-like group** (`C(C)(C)c1ccccc1`) adds steric bulk but is not highly polar. This may slightly reduce the property compared to simpler aromatic amides.

4. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is larger and more polar than simple aliphatics but less polar than molecules with nitro or sulfonyl groups (which often have higher values).

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
- A polar tertiary amide (increases value),
- Two aromatic rings (increase value),
- A bulky but non-polar tert-butyl-like group (slightly decreases value),

the property value is likely **between 1.0 and 1.4**, closer to the lower end due to the bulky group. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.15**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)  

---  
**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value for **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is approximately **1.15**.  

(If more context about the property were provided, the prediction could be refined further.)

Iteration: 45
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.10815805611694088
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a benzene ring substituted with a bromine atom (**Br**) and an acetamido group (**CC(=O)N-**). This is similar to molecules like:
   - **Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (-0.71349113): Benzene with an aldehyde and hydroxyl group.
   - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (-0.52087702): Benzene with a hydroxyl and bromine.
   - **Cc1ccc(N)cc1** (-0.69636351): Benzene with a methyl and amino group.

2. **Substituent Effects**:
   - The **Br** atom is electron-withdrawing, which tends to increase the property value slightly compared to pure hydrocarbons (e.g., **c1ccccc1** would likely be near 0).
   - The **CC(=O)N-** group is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (electron-withdrawing carbonyl and electron-donating nitrogen). This is somewhat similar to **Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (-0.71349113) but with an amide instead of hydroxyl + aldehyde.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** has a property value of **-0.52087702** (Br + OH).
   - **Cc1ccc(N)cc1** has **-0.69636351** (NH2 + CH3).
   - The amide group (**CC(=O)N-**) is more polar than OH or NH2 but less polar than nitro (**O=N(=O)c1ccccc1**, which is **-0.74291872**).

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the electron-withdrawing Br and the polar but moderately electron-donating amide group, the property value should be between **-0.5 and -0.7**. A reasonable estimate is slightly higher than **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (-0.52087702) due to the amide's additional polarity but lower than **Cc1ccc(N)cc1** (-0.69636351) because the amide is less electron-donating than NH2.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.58** (approximately midway between -0.52 and -0.69 for similar structures). 

This aligns with the observed trend where Br and amide substituents give moderately negative values in this dataset.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains**: 
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol): -1.00399922  
   - **CCCC(C)O** (pentan-2-ol): -0.76334786  
   - **CC(C)CCO** (isobutyl alcohol): -0.79353943  
   - Aliphatic chains with polar groups (e.g., -OH) tend to have negative values around -0.7 to -1.0.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline): -0.69384513  
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): -0.69738859  
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene): -0.37141989  
   - **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (methylnaphthalene): -0.18649315  
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24** (pyrene): 0.8282108  
   - Aromatic rings with small alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl) tend to have values between -0.7 and -0.3. Larger or more conjugated systems increase the value.

3. **Isobutyl Group Impact**:
   - The isobutyl group (**CC(C)C-**) appears in **CC(C)CCO** with a value of -0.79353943. When attached to a phenyl ring, the conjugation and hydrophobicity may slightly increase the value compared to aliphatic chains.

4. **Specific Comparison**:
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene): -0.37141989  
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene): -0.21032744  
   - The isobutyl group is bulkier than ethyl but less branched than isopropyl. The value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** should likely fall between these two, closer to -0.3 to -0.4.

### Prediction:
Given the trends, **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene) is expected to have a property value slightly higher than ethyltoluene (-0.371) but lower than isopropyltoluene (-0.210). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.32**  

This aligns with the observed trend where larger/bulkier alkyl groups on phenyl rings lead to less negative values, but the isobutyl group is not as impactful as highly conjugated or polar systems.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.7700165893561809
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - **Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1** (a carbonyl in a heterocycle): -0.751
   - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (a ketone in a ring): -0.127
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): -0.619
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (two amides + aromatic): 0.722
   - Benzaldehyde (**O=Cc1ccccc1**) has an aldehyde group (C=O) directly attached to a benzene ring, similar to some of these.

2. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Simple aromatic rings with no polar groups (e.g., **Cc1cccc2c(C)cccc12**): ~ -0.01 to -0.19
   - Aromatic rings with polar substituents (e.g., **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O**): more negative (~ -0.6)
   - Benzaldehyde has a polar aldehyde group attached to the ring, which should lower the property value compared to plain aromatics.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): -0.619
   - **COc1ccccc1** (methoxybenzene): -0.733
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (phenol + nitro): -0.686
   - Benzaldehyde is less polar than an amide or phenol but more polar than a plain aromatic. Its property value should be between these examples.

4. **Aldehyde-Specific Examples**:
   - No exact aldehyde examples are given, but **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a complex ketone): 2.311 (this is an outlier due to the large steroid structure).
   - Simpler carbonyls (like ketones/amides) tend to have negative values unless paired with other complex features.

### Prediction:
Benzaldehyde (**O=Cc1ccccc1**) has:
- A polar aldehyde group (electron-withdrawing), which reduces the property value compared to plain aromatics.
- No additional polar groups (like OH or NO2) to further lower the value.
- Structurally similar to **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol, -0.619) but less polar, so its value should be less negative.

Given this, a reasonable estimate is between **-0.5 and -0.7**. Averaging similar examples, I predict:

**Predicted property value for O=Cc1ccccc1: -0.65**  

*(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given data. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or experimental data would be needed.)*

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.08071928672108382
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Heterocyclic core**: The molecule contains a 5-membered ring with two amide (N-C=O) groups and a nitrogen linker (N-N=C). This is a relatively polar and rigid structure.
2. **Aromatic system**: The molecule has a substituted aromatic ring (benzofurazan-like moiety with a nitro group, N(=O)=O), which is highly electron-withdrawing.
3. **Polar functional groups**: The nitro group (N(=O)=O) and the amide groups (N-C=O) contribute to significant polarity and potential hydrogen bonding.

### Comparison to training examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups (e.g., **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2**, property = 0.600) tend to have positive property values.
- Molecules with multiple amide groups (e.g., **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, property = 1.013) also tend to have high positive values.
- The presence of a fused heterocyclic system (like the 5-membered ring here) is seen in **c1c(O)C2C(=O)C3cc(O)ccC3OC2cc1(OC)**, which has a property of 0.749.

### Predicted property:
Given the combination of a polar heterocycle, nitro group, and multiple amide functionalities, this molecule is likely to have a **high positive property value**. 

Looking at similar examples, the predicted property for **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2** is approximately:  
**0.85** (estimated range: 0.80–0.95).  

This is based on its structural similarity to molecules like **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (1.013)** and **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 (0.600)**, but with slightly less aromatic bulk than the former.

### Final answer:  
**Predicted property value: 0.85**
==================================================
Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.12919654258735747
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **-0.86922829**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene-like structure) has a property value of **0.08593173**.
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but with a single bond between the nitrogens instead of a double bond. This suggests its property value should be somewhat close to the azobenzene-like structure but likely slightly lower due to reduced conjugation/electron delocalization.

2. **Impact of Nitrogen Connectivity**:
   - The presence of **N-N** single bonds (as in hydrazines or diphenylamine derivatives) tends to reduce the property value compared to **N=N** double bonds (as in azobenzenes), as seen in the examples.

3. **Diphenylamine-Like Structures**:
   - The molecule is essentially a diphenylamine derivative (**NPh2**). While not directly in the examples, similar structures (e.g., **Nc1ccccc1**) suggest that adding a second phenyl group would increase the property value slightly but not as much as introducing a double bond (like in **N=N** systems).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a value of **-0.86922829**,
- **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene-like) has a value of **0.08593173**,
- The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is intermediate in conjugation between these two,

A reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than aniline but lower than the azobenzene-like structure. 

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is **-0.35**. 

This accounts for the reduced conjugation compared to the **N=N** system but more delocalization than a simple aniline.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 0.023171954006898615
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure (cyclohexane-like ring, **CCCC1**). 
   - It is a bicyclic system with fused 5- and 6-membered rings (lactam-like structure, similar to hydantoin or barbiturate derivatives but with a cyclohexane ring).

2. **Polarity/Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The two amide groups can act as both hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, increasing polarity and potential for intermolecular interactions.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = 0.58507177): This has a similar lactam structure with additional alkyl groups. The property value is moderately positive.
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = 0.07463613): This is a simpler cyclic diamide with less steric bulk.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = 0.58507177): This is structurally closer, with a cyclohexane ring fused to a 5-membered diamide.

4. **Steric and Electronic Effects**:
   - The cyclohexane ring adds steric bulk but no strong electronic effects (no aromaticity or conjugation beyond the amides).
   - The symmetry and lack of additional polar groups (e.g., nitro, hydroxyl) suggest a property value in the mid-range of the examples.

### Prediction:
Given the similarities to cyclic diamides with property values around **0.07 to 0.58**, and considering the additional cyclohexane ring (which may slightly increase the property due to steric bulk but not drastically), a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

This balances the contributions of the polar amides and the nonpolar cyclohexane ring, placing it between the simpler and more complex examples.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.5269053902798572
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **-0.54853599**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a heavily chlorinated biphenyl derivative) has a property value of **1.29603875**, suggesting that increased chlorine substitution on aromatic rings tends to increase the property value, especially if the molecule is larger and more hydrophobic.

2. **Biphenyl-like Structures**:
   - **C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13** (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a property value of **0.74000294**, indicating that fused aromatic rings or extended conjugation can increase the property value.

3. **Current Molecule**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is a **dichlorobiphenyl** with three chlorine substituents (two on one ring, one on the other). This is less chlorinated than the example with **1.29603875** but more chlorinated than simple dichlorobenzene.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Dichlorobenzene: **-0.54853599**
- Heavily chlorinated biphenyl: **1.29603875**
- Non-chlorinated biphenyl-like structures: ~**0.74**

The molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** has **three chlorines** and a biphenyl core. This places it between the dichlorobenzene and the heavily chlorinated biphenyl in terms of the property value. 

### Estimated Property Value:
A reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than the non-chlorinated biphenyl-like structure but lower than the heavily chlorinated example. 

**Predicted property value: ~0.85**

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at the trend:
- Adding chlorines to aromatic systems increases the property value.
- The given molecule has fewer chlorines than the example with **1.29603875**, but more than dichlorobenzene.

A more precise estimate would be in the range of **0.90 to 1.10**. 

**Final predicted property value: 1.05** (middle of the range, accounting for the three chlorines and biphenyl structure).

**Answer:** The predicted property value for **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is **1.05**.

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.13542704033517033
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Size**: Larger, more hydrophobic molecules (e.g., alkanes, aromatic rings with alkyl substituents) tend to have higher property values. For example:
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): **0.29755452**
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (long-chain alcohol): **1.16127763**

2. **Polar/Functional Groups**: Molecules with polar or electronegative groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -CO, halogens) tend to have lower property values. For example:
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde): **-0.77001659**
   - **ClCCCl** (dichloroethane): **-0.90954872**

3. **Aromatic Rings with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (toluidine): **-0.69384513** (lower due to -NH2 group)
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): **0.29755452** (higher due to long alkyl chain)

4. **Diethylbenzene Analogy**:
   - The molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is diethylbenzene, which has two ethyl groups attached to a benzene ring. This is structurally similar to:
     - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): **0.29755452**, but with shorter alkyl chains (ethyl instead of hexyl).
     - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): Not in the dataset, but ethyl groups are slightly larger than methyl and would increase the property value compared to toluene.

### Prediction:
- Diethylbenzene has two ethyl groups, which are smaller than the hexyl group in hexylbenzene but larger than the methyl group in toluene. The property value should be lower than hexylbenzene but higher than toluene (assuming toluene would be slightly negative or near zero).
- From the examples, **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene) is **0.29755452**, and **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine) is **-0.60329876** (lower due to the polar nitrogen).
- Diethylbenzene lacks polar groups and has moderate hydrophobicity, so the value should be positive but less than hexylbenzene.

### Estimated Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is:  
**~0.15 to 0.25**.  

A precise prediction based on the examples would be:  
**0.21000000** (a compromise between the hexylbenzene and smaller alkyl-aromatic examples).

### Final Answer:
**0.21000000**
==================================================
Iteration: 53
SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 0.0694909304372595
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with highly polar or charged groups (e.g., nitro groups `N(=O)=O`, sulfonyl groups `S(=O)(=O)`, or multiple halogens) tend to have higher property values.
   - Molecules with nonpolar or weakly polar groups (e.g., simple hydrocarbons, ethers) tend to have lower or negative property values.

2. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, sulfonyl) increase the property value.
   - Aromatic rings with electron-donating groups (e.g., `NH2`, `OH`) often decrease the property value unless paired with strong electron-withdrawing groups.

3. **Sulfonyl Groups**:
   - Molecules with `S(=O)(=O)` groups (e.g., `COP(=O)(OC)OC(Br)C(Cl)(Cl)Br` with property 1.059) tend to have higher property values.
   - The presence of `S(N)(=O)=O` (sulfonamide) is similar to sulfonyl but may have a slightly different effect depending on the substituents.

4. **Amine Groups**:
   - `NH2` groups alone (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` with property -0.659) tend to decrease the property value unless paired with strong electron-withdrawing groups.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** has:
- An aromatic ring with an electron-donating `NH2` group.
- A strongly electron-withdrawing sulfonamide group `S(N)(=O)=O`.

Comparing to similar molecules:
- `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a property of **-0.659** (amine + nitro).
- `Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` has a property of **-0.355** (two nitro groups).
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1` has a property of **1.208** (phosphorothioate + nitro).

The sulfonamide group `S(N)(=O)=O` is less electron-withdrawing than a nitro group but more than a simple amine. The `NH2` group will donate electrons, partially offsetting the sulfonamide's effect.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the electron-donating `NH2` and electron-withdrawing `S(N)(=O)=O`, the property value should be slightly positive but not as high as molecules with multiple nitro or sulfonyl groups. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.25** (approximate, likely between 0.1 and 0.4). 

However, looking more closely at the examples, `Nc1ncnc2n(ccc12)C3OC(CO)C(O)C3O` (with multiple heteroatoms and polar groups) has a value of **0.657**, while `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` is **-0.659**. The sulfonamide here is less electron-withdrawing than nitro, so the value should be higher than -0.659 but not as high as 0.657. 

A refined estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.10** (likely in the range 0.0 to 0.3). 

Given the examples, the most plausible value is:  
**0.15** (but since the examples suggest discrete values, I'll round to **0.10**). 

However, comparing to `Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (-0.355), the sulfonamide is less electron-withdrawing than nitro, so the value should be higher. 

Final prediction:  
**0.20** (approximate). 

But to match the precision of the examples, I'll suggest:  
**0.25**. 

Given the uncertainty, the closest reasonable guess is:  
**0.10**. 

After reconsidering, the sulfonamide is more electron-withdrawing than I initially thought, so the value is likely higher. 

Final answer:  
**Predicted property value: 0.35**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. The true value could vary depending on the specific property, but this is a reasonable estimate.)

Iteration: 54
SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 0.5475977431945522
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings, forming a **tetracene-like** or **pyrene-like** structure. The SMILES notation describes a system where:
- Ring 1 (c1ccc2c(c1)...) is fused to Ring 2 (c2...).
- Ring 2 is further fused to Ring 3 (c3cccc4...).
- Ring 4 (c34) closes the loop, creating a compact, planar, and conjugated system.

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Aromaticity and Conjugation**: 
   - Molecules with extended conjugation (e.g., fused aromatic rings) tend to have higher property values. For example:
     - `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` (property = 1.001) has 4 fused rings.
     - `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` (property = 1.141) has 5 fused rings.
   - The given molecule has 4 fused rings, similar to these examples.

2. **Substituents and Heteroatoms**:
   - The absence of electronegative substituents (e.g., Cl, Br, NO₂) or heteroatoms (O, N, S) suggests the property will be lower than heavily substituted PAHs (e.g., `ClC1(C(=O)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C14Cl)...` with property = 2.151).
   - Simpler PAHs like `c1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32` (property = 0.407) or `Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32` (property = 0.407) are good benchmarks.

3. **Size and Planarity**:
   - The molecule is larger than naphthalene (`c1ccc2c1cccc2`, not in examples but likely ~0.3–0.5) but smaller than 5-ring systems (~1.0–1.2). 
   - Compactness (like pyrene) may increase the property slightly compared to linear tetracene.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to `c1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32` (property = 0.407) and `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` (property = 1.141), but with one fewer ring than the latter, the property should lie between these values. A reasonable estimate is **~0.8–1.0**. 

Considering the compactness and lack of substituents, I predict:  
**Predicted property value: 0.95**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 0.8280164053794498
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - Multiple hydroxyl groups (**-OH**) attached to aromatic rings (phenolic groups).
   - A carbonyl group (**C=O**) in a cyclic structure (likely a flavone or flavonoid-like core).
   - Ether linkage (**-O-**) connecting two aromatic systems.
   - Extended conjugation due to aromatic rings and the carbonyl group.

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The presence of multiple **-OH** groups suggests high polarity and strong hydrogen-bonding capacity, which typically correlates with higher property values in the given examples (e.g., **OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5** has a value of **3.31475038** due to similar features).

3. **Aromaticity and Conjugation**: 
   - The molecule has three aromatic rings (two with **-OH** groups and one fused with a carbonyl-containing ring), which increases electron delocalization and likely raises the property value.

4. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple **-OH** groups and conjugated systems (e.g., flavonoids or polyphenols) tend to have higher property values (e.g., **1.30566524**, **3.31475038**).
   - The given molecule resembles a flavonoid derivative, which often exhibits higher values due to its extended conjugation and polarity.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to high-value examples (especially **3.31475038** for a polyphenolic system), but with slightly less complexity (fewer rings and no halogen substitution), the predicted value would be slightly lower but still significant.

**Predicted Property Value: 2.75**

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 0.7290841049681274
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns in the property values based on molecular features:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **High property values (> 1.0)** are associated with:
   - Complex structures with multiple functional groups (e.g., phosphates, aromatic rings, halogens like Cl).
   - Examples: 
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (1.43031352) – contains P=S, aromatic Cl substitutions.
     - `ClC1(C(=O)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C14Cl)C5(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C45Cl` (2.15054671) – highly chlorinated polycyclic structure.
     - `CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` (2.39613488) – steroid-like structure with multiple rings and polar groups.

2. **Moderate property values (0.5–1.0)** are seen in:
   - Molecules with aromatic rings, polar groups (e.g., NO2, esters), or moderate halogenation.
   - Examples:
     - `CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2` (1.04557479) – aromatic with ester and amide groups.
     - `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl` (0.65004066) – aromatic with Cl and ether linkages.

3. **Low property values (< 0.5, often negative)** are seen in:
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCC` = -0.77879168).
   - Small polar groups (e.g., alcohols, amines) without strong electron-withdrawing or complex features.
   - Examples:
     - `CCCCO` (-0.7473509) – simple alcohol.
     - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (-0.74132966) – small heterocycle with amide.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** has the following features:
- **Phosphate group (P=O)**: Present in high-value examples (e.g., `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` = 1.47151468).
- **Thioester (SC)**: Less common, but sulfur can increase property value (e.g., `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` = 3.29001308).
- **Amide (NC(C)=O)**: Moderately polar, but not as impactful as halogens or aromaticity.
- **Lack of aromaticity or halogens**: This reduces the property value compared to highly substituted aromatics.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (1.47151468) has a phosphate + aromatic Cl substitutions.
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (1.43031352) has P=S + aromatic Cl.
- `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` (3.29001308) has P=S + thioether + amide + aliphatic chain.

Our molecule lacks aromaticity and halogens but has P=O and thioester, which are significant. It is less complex than the highest examples but more complex than simple aliphatics.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the phosphate + thioester combination but no aromaticity/halogens, the value should be **moderate-high**, likely between **1.0 and 1.5**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**1.25** (specific value: **1.25143652**). 

This aligns with the influence of P=O and SC while accounting for the lack of additional complexity.

**Final Answer:**  
Predicted property value for **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**: **1.25143652**.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -1.1035618263338451
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - **CC1CCCC1** (cyclohexane): -0.576  
   - **CCCC(C)C** (branched alkane): -0.629  
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane): -0.913  
   - **CCC=O** (butanal): -1.226  
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): 1.138  
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (dichlorophenol): -0.492  

   Halogenated compounds (Cl, Br) tend to have property values ranging from negative (for small/linear molecules) to positive (for larger/aromatic systems). 

2. **Alkenes and Halogenated Alkenes**:
   - **CCCC(=C)C** (branched alkene): -0.779  
   - **Cl\C=C/Cl** is a small, symmetric halogenated alkene. No exact match is present, but similar small halogenated molecules (e.g., **CCBr**) have negative values.

3. **Symmetry and Polarity**:
   - The trans-configuration of **Cl\C=C/Cl** (assuming trans-dichloroethene) is symmetric and less polar than cis, which might slightly increase the property value compared to very small polar molecules like **CCC=O** (-1.226).

4. **Comparison to Cl-containing Aromatics**:
   - Aromatic Cl-substituted molecules (e.g., **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**: -0.492) have less negative values than aliphatic Cl-substituted molecules (e.g., **CCBr**: -0.913). This suggests that aliphatic Cl-substituted molecules (like **Cl\C=C/Cl**) will likely have more negative values.

### Prediction:
Given that **Cl\C=C/Cl** is a small, aliphatic, halogenated alkene, its property value is expected to be negative but less negative than very small polar molecules like **CCC=O** (-1.226) or **CCBr** (-0.913). A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.7 and -0.5**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Cl\C=C/Cl** is **-0.65**.

Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -1.0163934041463323
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., **c1ccccc1**, benzene-like) tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative. For example:
     - **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline): -0.675
     - **Cc1cccc2c1Cc3ccccc32** (methyl-substituted polyaromatic): 0.322
   - Heteroaromatic systems (containing N, O, or S) often have slightly more negative values unless they have additional polar or bulky substituents. For example:
     - **COc5cc4OCC3Oc2c1CC(Oc1ccc2C(=O)C3c4cc5OC)C(C)=C**: 2.241 (complex heteroaromatic with multiple polar groups)
     - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2**: -0.374 (simple N-heteroaromatic).

2. **Nitrogen in Aromatic Rings**:
   - Pyridine-like structures (single N in a 6-membered ring) are not explicitly in the examples, but similar N-heteroaromatics (e.g., **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2**) suggest a slight negative contribution from the N atom.
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1**: 0.838 (has polar amide groups, not directly comparable).

3. **Simple vs. Complex Systems**:
   - Simpler aromatic/heteroaromatic systems (no substituents or small substituents) tend to have values between -0.7 and 0.3.
   - **c1ccncc1** is a simple heteroaromatic with no substituents, so its value should be closer to the lower end of this range.

4. **Comparison to Benzene**:
   - If benzene (no N) were in the dataset, it would likely have a value near zero. Adding a nitrogen (pyridine) introduces polarity and lone pair effects, likely reducing the property value slightly.

### Prediction:
Given the simplicity of pyridine and the trends observed for similar N-heteroaromatics, I predict the property value for **c1ccncc1** to be slightly negative, around **-0.4 to -0.6**. 

A reasonable estimate based on the closest examples is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.55**  

This aligns with the slight negative shift observed for N-containing aromatics compared to pure hydrocarbons.

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 1.7087496909495048
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Ether (OCC(O)CO-)**: Similar to ether-containing molecules in the examples (e.g., COC1=CC(=O)..., CCOC(=O)CC), which tend to have property values in the range of -0.5 to 0.5.
   - **Ester (COC(=O))**: Present in molecules like CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC (property = 0.36661349) and CCOC(=O)CC (property = -0.54708521). Esters can contribute positively or negatively depending on the rest of the structure.
   - **Aromatic ring (c1ccccc1)**: Common in many examples, with values ranging from -0.5 to 0.5.
   - **Amine linkage (Nc2ccnc3...)**: Similar to N-containing groups like NC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2 (property = 0.32104556) or Nc1ccccc1 (positive contribution).
   - **Chlorine substitution (Cl)**: Often reduces the property value slightly (e.g., Clc1ccc(I)cc1 = -0.25608038, ClCCCl = -0.90954872).
   - **Heterocycle (ccnc3...)**: Similar to c1ccc2cnccc2c1 (property = -0.42512743) or c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3 (property = 0.17461259). Heterocycles can vary but often contribute moderately.

2. **Complexity**:
   - The molecule is relatively large and complex, with multiple functional groups. Larger fused-ring systems in the examples (e.g., c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54, property = 1.14138211) tend to have higher property values due to extended conjugation or rigidity.

3. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - The presence of -OH (OCC(O)) and polar groups (ester, amine) suggests moderate polarity, which may balance the property value.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule resembles a combination of:
  - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC** (property = 0.36661349): ester + aromatic.
  - **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** (property = 0.32034629): amide + aromatic.
  - **c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3** (property = 0.17461259): heterocycle + aromatic.
- The chlorine substitution and additional complexity may slightly reduce the value compared to these.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of positive contributions (ester, aromatic, amine) and negative contributions (chlorine, heterocycle), the property value is likely in the **moderately positive range**, similar to the examples above. 

**Predicted property value: 0.28** (approximate, likely between 0.2 and 0.4). 

This aligns with the trend observed for similarly complex, polar, and conjugated molecules in the provided data.

Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.7328605230559835
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): -0.33382487
   - **CCCCCCCI** (1-iodohexane): 0.30959531
   - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C** (complex steroid-like): 2.64206661
   - **C1CCC2CCCCC2C1** (decalin): 0.29544264
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tertiary alcohol): -0.47324807
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol): -0.07986232

   Hydrocarbon chains with no functional groups tend to have negative or low-positive values. Introducing polar or functional groups (e.g., -OH, -I) increases the property value.

2. **Alcohols (-OH group)**:
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol): -0.07986232
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tertiary alcohol): -0.47324807
   - **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol) is a primary alcohol with a linear chain. Primary alcohols are more polar than tertiary alcohols, so the value should be higher than -0.47324807 but likely lower than cycloheptanol due to less ring strain/rigidity.

3. **Chain Length and Polarity**:
   - Longer chains with polar groups (e.g., -OH) have higher values than shorter ones. For example, **CCCCCCCI** (6-carbon chain) has a higher value (0.30959531) than **CCC(C)Cl** (4-carbon chain, -0.80693207).
   - **CCCCCO** has 5 carbons and a polar -OH group, so its value should be between -0.47324807 (tertiary alcohol) and 0.30959531 (iodohexane).

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol): -0.07986232 (cyclic alcohol)
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**: -0.47324807 (sterically hindered alcohol)
   - **CCCCCO** is less hindered and more polar than the tertiary alcohol but less constrained than cycloheptanol. A reasonable estimate would be slightly negative or near zero.

### Predicted Property for CCCCO:
Given the above trends, **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol) is expected to have a property value close to **-0.1 to 0.1**. A plausible estimate is:
**-0.05**

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCCO** is approximately **-0.05**.

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 1.1876567950509547
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O))** attached to a **cyclic ether (CCO1)** and a **substituted benzene ring (Nc2ccccc2)**. This suggests moderate polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding (via the amide **C(=O)N**).
2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Aromatic ring (benzene) with an amide linkage (**C(=O)N**).
   - Sulfonyl group (**S(=O)(=O)**), which is highly polar and often increases property values in the examples (e.g., sulfonyl-containing molecules like **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** have values > 1.5).
   - Cyclic ether (**CCO1**), which may slightly reduce the property value compared to purely aromatic or sulfonyl-dominated structures.
3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with sulfonyl/phosphoryl groups (e.g., **CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C**: 2.38, **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: 1.53) tend to have high positive values.
   - Amide-containing aromatic systems (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3**: 0.72) have intermediate values.
   - The presence of both sulfonyl and amide here suggests a value between **0.7 and 1.5**, likely closer to the lower end due to the cyclic ether's moderating effect.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of polar (sulfonyl, amide) and moderately polar (cyclic ether) groups, the predicted value is approximately **0.85**. 

---
**Final Answer**: **0.85**  
*(Rationale: Intermediate polarity from sulfonyl + amide, offset by cyclic ether, aligning with similar examples.)*

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 1.3261894871760944
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic system with nitro group**: The molecule contains a benzene ring with a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`), which is electron-withdrawing. From the examples, similar structures with nitro groups tend to have moderately positive or negative values (e.g., `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has -0.570, `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` has 1.117).
2. **Ester groups (`C(=O)OC`)**: The molecule has two ester groups, which are polar and can contribute to higher property values (e.g., `CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC` has 2.892).
3. **Heterocyclic nitrogen**: The five-membered ring with a nitrogen (`NC(=C)`) may slightly increase the property value (similar to `CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O` with 0.541).
4. **Substituted aromatic system**: The benzene ring is part of a larger conjugated system, which can increase the property value (e.g., `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` has 0.146).

### Comparison to examples:
- The presence of multiple polar groups (esters, nitro) and conjugation suggests a higher property value, likely in the range of 1.0 to 2.0.
- The closest analogs are molecules like `CCN(CC)C(=S)SSC(=S)N(CC)CC` (1.778) or `CC2Cc1ccccc1N2NC(=O)c3ccc(Cl)c(c3)S(N)(=O)=O` (2.077), which have polar/charged groups and conjugated systems.

### Predicted property value:
Given the structural similarities and the contributions from the nitro group, esters, and conjugation, the predicted property value is:

**1.45** (approximate, likely between 1.3 and 1.6). 

This is based on the balance between the electron-withdrawing nitro group and the electron-donating ester groups, along with the conjugated system.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.39774763550368114
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). It is a cyclic diamide (imide) structure with a fused cyclopropane.
2. **Polarity**: The presence of two highly polar amide groups suggests significant dipole interactions.
3. **Rigidity**: The cyclopropane ring and fused imide structure introduce rigidity, which may influence the property.
4. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., **ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, property = 1.07896423) tend to have higher property values.
   - Cyclic structures with polar groups (e.g., **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**, property = 2.46909208) also show higher values.
   - Simple amides or imides (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1**, property = -0.0227113) can have lower values, but rigidity and additional polar groups increase the property.

### Prediction:
Given the fused cyclic imide structure with two amide groups and a cyclopropane ring, the molecule is likely to have a **moderate to high property value**. Comparing to similar structures in the examples, a reasonable estimate would be around **0.8 to 1.2**. 

A precise prediction based on the closest analogs (e.g., rigid polar cyclic systems) suggests:  
**Predicted property value: 0.95**  

This aligns with the trend where rigid, polar cyclic structures (especially those with multiple carbonyl/amide groups) exhibit higher property values in the dataset.

Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: -1.159859892071912
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCC** (chloroethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Halogenated Alkanes**:
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): -0.77879168  
   - **CCC(C)(C)CC** (branched alkane): -0.48115659  
   - **C1CC=CC1** (cyclopentene): -0.89007594  
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): -0.75209833  
   - **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl** (highly chlorinated complex): 1.5915385  
   - **CC#N** (acetonitrile): -1.49040119  

   Simple hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values, while more complex or highly halogenated structures have higher (sometimes positive) values.

2. **Chlorinated Small Alkanes**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): -0.75209833  
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (pentachlorobenzene): -0.1414113  
   - **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl** (complex chlorinated): 1.5915385  

   Adding more chlorine atoms tends to increase the property value, but small chlorinated molecules (like chloroethane) are likely to have negative or low values.

3. **Chloroethane (ClCC)**:
   - This is a very small molecule with a single chlorine substituent on a two-carbon chain. It is simpler than chlorobenzene (which has a value of -0.752) and much simpler than highly chlorinated examples.  
   - Comparing to **CCCCC** (pentane, -0.778) and **CC#N** (acetonitrile, -1.490), chloroethane is likely to have a value between these, closer to simple alkanes but slightly higher due to the polar chlorine.

### Predicted Property for ClCC:
Given the simplicity of chloroethane and the trend that small halogenated alkanes have negative values but higher than pure alkanes, I predict:  
**Property value for ClCC: ~ -0.65**

This is slightly less negative than pentane (-0.778) due to the polar chlorine but more negative than chlorobenzene (-0.752) because of the smaller size and lack of aromaticity.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for ClCC: -0.65** (approximate, based on trends in the data).

SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: -0.023323601487060565
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms (e.g., **ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)...**, **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c...**) tend to have higher property values, especially when the chlorines are densely packed or on aromatic rings. For example:
     - **ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)...** (highly chlorinated cage) has a value of **2.54190481**.
     - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene derivative) has a value of **0.27741138**.
     - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (polychlorinated biphenyl-like) has a value of **0.52690539**.
   - The presence of **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (trichloromethyl group) is seen in **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, which has a value of **1.29603875**.

2. **Aromatic Systems with Heteroatoms**:
   - Aromatic rings with nitrogen (e.g., pyridine-like structures) often have moderately negative to positive values depending on other substituents. For example:
     - **c2ccc1ocnc1c2** (benzofuran with nitrogen) has a value of **-0.63788094**.
     - **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1** (pyridine derivative) has a value of **-0.63609976**.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** combines:
     - A chlorinated aromatic ring (similar to **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** but with fewer chlorines on the ring).
     - A trichloromethyl group (**C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**), which is strongly contributing (as seen in **1.29603875** for a similar case).
     - A nitrogen in the aromatic ring (pyridine-like), which may slightly reduce the value compared to pure chlorinated aromatics.

### Prediction:
Given the strong contribution of the **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group and the moderately chlorinated aromatic ring with nitrogen, the property value is likely in the range of **0.8 to 1.3**. 

Comparing to the most similar example:
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has a value of **1.29603875**, but our molecule has one less aromatic ring and a nitrogen in the ring (which may slightly lower the value). 

Thus, a reasonable prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.05** (approximately between 0.9 and 1.2 based on the trends). 

However, since the trichloromethyl group is a dominant contributor and the nitrogen may not offset it significantly, a more precise estimate would be closer to **1.1**. 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl: 1.10**

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.5528880674389008
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and trends observed in the molecular structures and their corresponding property values, I can predict the property for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (a branched alcohol with a 5-carbon chain and a hydroxyl group). 

### Observations:
1. **Alcohols with short/linear chains** tend to have negative property values (e.g., **CCCC(O)CCC** = -0.326, **CC(O)c1ccccc1** = -0.518, **CCC(C)CCO** = -0.567, **CCC(CC)CO** = -0.551).
2. **Branching** slightly affects the property, but the dominant factor is the presence of the hydroxyl group, which consistently correlates with negative values in this dataset.
3. The molecule **CCCCC(C)O** is structurally similar to **CCC(C)CCO** (property = -0.567) and **CCC(CC)CO** (property = -0.551), but with a slightly longer carbon chain. 

### Prediction:
Given the trends, the property value for **CCCCC(C)O** should be in the range of **-0.50 to -0.60**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: -0.55**  

This aligns with the observed trend where alcohols with moderate chain lengths and branching have property values around this range.

1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorodiphenyl, 0.32334305)
   - **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O** (complex halogenated aromatic, 1.07510006)
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene, not explicitly listed, but similar to **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** with -0.49201053, though the hydroxyl group likely lowers the value).

   Halogenated aromatics with simple substitutions (e.g., dichlorobenzene-like structures) tend to have property values in the range of **0.3 to 0.5**, unless other functional groups significantly alter the value.

2. **Bromine vs. Chlorine Effects**:
   - Bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine, which may slightly increase the property value compared to chlorine analogs (due to greater electronic effects).
   - Example: **CI** (iodomethane-like, -0.72775552) vs. no direct Br analog, but Br is less electronegative than Cl, potentially raising the value slightly.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution Pattern**:
   - 1,4-disubstituted benzenes (para-substitution) often have moderate values unless highly polar groups are present.
   - **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is symmetric and lacks additional functional groups, suggesting a value similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** but adjusted for bromine.

4. **Comparison to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**:
   - If we assume **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** would have a value around **0.3** (like the dichlorodiphenyl example), replacing Cl with Br might increase the value slightly due to bromine's polarizability.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is likely in the range of **0.4 to 0.6**. A reasonable estimate is:

**0.45** (reflecting the bromine effect and symmetry). 

### Final Answer:
**0.45**

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 1.135074032727647
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, halogenation (particularly chlorination), aromaticity, and symmetry. The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated biphenyl derivative with significant symmetry and aromaticity, similar to some of the higher-valued examples.

Let's analyze the given examples for context:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic systems** (e.g., `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) have high property values (1.95939696). This suggests that chlorination and aromatic stacking increase the property.
2. The molecule `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl` is structurally similar but slightly less chlorinated (missing two chlorines compared to the example above) and has a less dense halogenation pattern. 
3. Other highly chlorinated or brominated aromatic systems also tend to have elevated values (e.g., `CCCCCCCBr` at 0.13949633, though less dramatic due to being aliphatic).

Given this, the property value for `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl` should be slightly lower than the most chlorinated example (1.95939696) but still significantly positive due to its aromaticity and halogenation. 

### Predicted property value: **1.7** (approximate, likely between 1.6 and 1.8 based on the trend). 

This is an estimate based on the observed trend where:
- More chlorines → higher value.
- Aromatic systems → higher value.
- Symmetry → likely contributes positively. 

The exact value isn't derivable without a clear formula, but this is a reasonable interpolation from the given data.

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 2.318811887738143
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**: Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -NO₂, -CN, -P=O, -S=O) tend to have higher property values (often >1.0). For example:
   - Phosphorothioate groups (e.g., **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O**) have high values (~3.14).
   - Multiple polar groups (e.g., sugars or polyols) also increase the value (e.g., **OCC3OC(OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C(O)C3O** has a value of ~2.41).

2. **Aromatic Rings and Substitution**: 
   - Aromatic rings with polar substituents (e.g., -Cl, -OCH₃, -NO₂) increase the value (e.g., **Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1** has ~1.77).
   - Non-polar aromatic rings (e.g., **c1ccccc1**) or simple alkyl substitutions (e.g., **CC(C)c1ccccc1**) have lower values (~-0.38 to 0.0).

3. **Size and Complexity**: Larger, more complex molecules (e.g., steroids or fused rings) tend to have higher values if they include polar groups (e.g., **CC12CC(=O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO** has ~2.33).

4. **Non-Polar/Aliphatic Chains**: Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCC**) have negative values (~-0.98 to 0.0).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1** has:
- A central **phosphate group (P=O)** with two aromatic ether linkages (**Oc2cccc(C)c2** and **Oc3ccccc3C**).
- Three aromatic rings (two substituted with methyl groups).
- Moderate polarity due to the phosphate and ether oxygens but no highly polar groups like -OH or -NO₂.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC** (phosphorothioate with aliphatic chains): ~2.49.
- **COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (aromatic with polar substituents): ~1.33.
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** (aromatic with halogens): ~0.53.

The target molecule is less polar than phosphorothioates but more polar than simple halogenated aromatics. The phosphate group and aromatic ethers suggest a value in the **1.5–2.0 range**.

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.75** (estimated based on structural similarity to examples with phosphate/aromatic features).

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.9413418067120207
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

---

### **Key Structural Features of the Molecule:**
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**:  
   - Present in the fragment **FC(F)(F)**.  
   - From the examples, molecules with **CF3** (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C`) tend to have **higher property values (~1.109)** due to electronegativity and lipophilicity contributions.

2. **Aromatic ring with substituents**:  
   - The **c1cccc(c1)** fragment is a benzene ring with a **CF3** and a **N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O** substituent.  
   - Similar aromatic systems with polar substituents (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`) have values around **-0.659**, but the presence of **CF3** and **Cl** increases the value.

3. **Chlorine atoms (Cl)**:  
   - Two **Cl** atoms are present in the **N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O** fragment.  
   - Chlorine tends to **increase the property value** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a value of **1.343**).

4. **Ketone group (C=O)**:  
   - The **C2=O** group is polar but may not drastically lower the value if balanced by other hydrophobic groups.

5. **Heterocyclic nitrogen (N2CC...)**:  
   - The **N2** is part of a strained ring with **Cl** and **C=O**, which may moderately increase the value.

---

### **Comparison with Similar Examples:**
- **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2**: Multiple **Cl** atoms and aromatic rings → **1.150**.  
- **NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl**: Polar groups + **Cl** → **1.455**.  
- **CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C**: **CF3** + polar groups → **1.109**.  

Given these, our molecule has:
- **CF3** (+ contribution)  
- **Two Cl atoms** (+ contribution)  
- **Aromatic ring + polar N/C=O** (neutral/slight + contribution)  

---

### **Predicted Property Value:**
Considering the balance of **CF3**, **Cl**, and polar groups, the value is likely **between 1.1 and 1.5**. A reasonable estimate is:  

**Predicted value: 1.25**  

*(This is an interpolation based on the examples, accounting for the combined effects of CF3, Cl, and the heterocyclic ketone.)*  

--- 

### **Final Answer:**  
**Predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O: ~1.25**

Iteration: 71
SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.5202358011681483
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic ring (benzene)**: Present in many examples, often with substituents.
   - Example: `c1ccccc1O` has a value of **-0.89661683** (phenol).
   - Example: `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (dinitrobenzene) has a value of **-0.53269516**.
   - Example: `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (xylene) has a value of **-0.60741274**.

2. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: 
   - The nitro group is electron-withdrawing and appears in some examples with values around **-0.5 to 0.5** depending on other substituents.
   - Example: `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has **-0.53269516** (two nitro groups).
   - Example: `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` has **0.91577754** (nitro not directly on the ring, but with other polar groups).

3. **Methoxy group (OCH3)**:
   - The methoxy group is electron-donating and appears in examples like `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (dimethyl phthalate) with a value of **-0.12799533**.
   - It is less polarizing than nitro but contributes to the overall balance.

### Comparison:
- The molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is **p-nitrophenyl methyl ether** (or 4-nitroanisole), which has:
  - One electron-donating methoxy group.
  - One electron-withdrawing nitro group.
  - The nitro group is more influential in determining the property than the methoxy group.

From similar examples:
- `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (two nitro groups): **-0.53269516**.
- `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (two ester groups): **-0.12799533**.
- `c1ccccc1O` (phenol): **-0.89661683**.

Given that **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has one nitro and one methoxy, the property value should be between **-0.5 and 0.0**, closer to the nitrobenzene-like examples but slightly higher due to the methoxy group.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.35** (estimated based on the balance between the electron-withdrawing nitro and electron-donating methoxy groups). 

However, looking more closely at the examples, `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` is **-0.53269516**, and adding a methoxy group (which is less polarizing than a second nitro) would likely increase the value slightly. Thus, a more precise estimate is:

**-0.45** (closer to the nitrobenzene value but slightly less negative due to the methoxy group). 

But reviewing the data again, `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` (with complex polar groups) is **0.91577754**, while simpler nitro-aromatics are negative. Thus, for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, the value is likely in the **-0.3 to -0.5** range.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.40** (a compromise between the nitro-dominated negativity and the methoxy moderation). 

However, the closest direct analogue is `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` at **-0.53269516**, and replacing one nitro with methoxy would raise the value slightly. Thus, the most accurate prediction is:

**-0.45**. 

But given the variability, I would refine this to **-0.42** as a balanced estimate. 

### Official Answer:
**-0.42** (predicted property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O).

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 1.7217320216777492
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and the presence of specific functional groups or halogens (Cl, Br, F). The molecule in question is highly chlorinated and has a complex polycyclic structure, which suggests a higher property value due to increased steric and electronic effects.

Breaking it down:
1. **Highly chlorinated molecules**: 
   - `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` has a value of **0.70019704**, which is relatively high due to its symmetry and multiple Cl atoms.
   - `Clc1ccccc1` (monochlorobenzene) has a value of **-0.75209833**, much lower due to fewer Cl atoms and simpler structure.
   - The presence of multiple Cl atoms tends to increase the property value.

2. **Complex polycyclic structures**:
   - `CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2` has a value of **0.16812328**, showing that even moderately complex alicyclic structures can have positive values.
   - `Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13` (a polyaromatic hydrocarbon) has a value of **1.17897713**, indicating that fused ring systems increase the property value significantly.

3. **Combination of high Cl count and polycyclic complexity**:
   - The given molecule `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` is a heavily chlorinated polycyclic system (likely a chlorinated bornane or similar terpene derivative). This combines both features (many Cl atoms and fused rings) that push the property value higher.

### Prediction:
Given the extreme chlorination and polycyclic nature, the property value should be **higher than 0.70019704** (hexachlorocyclohexane) but likely **less than 1.17897713** (polyaromatic hydrocarbon without halogens). A reasonable estimate would be around **1.0 to 1.3**. 

Looking at other examples with high values:
- `CS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(cc1)C(O)C(CO)NC(=O)C(Cl)Cl` has a value of **1.8265895**, but it has additional polar groups (SO2, OH, CO, etc.).
- `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (less complex) is **0.70019704**.

The given molecule is more complex than `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` but lacks other polar groups, so I predict a value slightly higher than the hexachlorocyclohexane but not as high as the sulfonyl/hydroxy examples. 

### Final predicted value: **1.25** (approximate, likely between 1.2 and 1.3). 

For precision, I would estimate **1.248** (matching the style of the given data). 

However, since the examples with similar complexity (e.g., `CC(=O)C3(C)CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C`) have values like **2.44887047**, but this is less chlorinated, I might adjust downward. 

Given the uncertainty, a conservative estimate is **1.24887047** (mirroring the style of other values). 

But reviewing again, the highest chlorinated example is **0.70019704**, and the given molecule is much more chlorinated and complex, so **1.24887047** seems reasonable. 

### Final answer: **1.24887047**
==================================================
Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.9669541574898656
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with highly polar or electronegative groups (e.g., -NO₂, -SO₃H, halogens) tend to have higher (less negative) property values.
   - Ethers (e.g., -O-) and esters (e.g., -COO-) often have moderately negative to slightly positive values, depending on other substituents.
   - Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, aromatics without polar groups) tend to have more negative values.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer carbon chains or branching can slightly increase the property value (less negative), but the effect is secondary to functional groups.

3. **Specific Examples**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate): Property = -0.21060959  
     (Contains ester and amine, moderately negative).
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2**: Property = 1.21067146  
     (Complex ester with ether and aromatic rings, positive value).
   - **COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67**: Property = 4.00408841  
     (Highly complex with multiple ethers and esters, very high value).
   - **CC(=O)O** (acetic acid, not in the list but analogous): Small esters like formates/acetates are typically in the moderately negative range.

4. **Propyl Formate (CCCOC=O)**:
   - This is a simple ester with a 3-carbon chain and a formate group (-OC=O). 
   - Compared to **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (property = -0.2106), propyl formate lacks the aromatic ring and amine, which likely reduces the property value slightly further.
   - Esters without additional polar groups (like amines or halogens) tend to have values in the range of -0.3 to -0.6.

### Prediction:
Given the simplicity of propyl formate (no aromaticity or additional polar groups), its property value should be slightly more negative than ethyl 4-aminobenzoate (-0.2106) but less negative than purely nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCC#C** with -1.227). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value for CCCOC=O: -0.45**

### Note:
This is an educated guess based on the examples and trends. The actual value could vary slightly depending on the specific property being modeled (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), but the trend should hold for most bulk physicochemical properties.
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.7156735606133096
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Long Hydrocarbon Chain (CCCCCCCCC)**: The molecule has a long aliphatic chain (10 carbons, including the carbonyl carbon). From the examples, molecules with longer aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCCCCc1ccccc1 with property 0.297) tend to have higher property values than shorter chains (e.g., CC with property -1.374). This suggests the long chain contributes positively to the property.
2. **Ester Functional Group (C(=O)OCC)**: The molecule is an ester (specifically, decyl acetate with an ethyl group instead of methyl). Esters are polar but not as polar as acids or alcohols. Examples with esters (e.g., COCC(=O)N(...) with property 0.893) show moderate to high values, while simpler esters like CCOC(=O)... are not directly listed, but polar groups generally increase the property compared to pure hydrocarbons.
3. **Lack of Aromaticity or Heteroatoms**: The molecule has no aromatic rings or heteroatoms (other than the ester oxygen), which often contribute to property values in the examples. Pure aliphatic chains with polar termini (like this ester) are less common in the examples, but we can interpolate.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): Property = 0.297. This has a shorter aliphatic chain and an aromatic ring, which often increases the property. Our molecule has a longer chain but no aromaticity, so the value might be slightly lower due to lack of aromaticity but higher due to the longer chain and ester.
- **COCC(=O)N(...)**: Property = 0.893. This is a more complex ester with additional functional groups, so our simpler ester should have a lower value.
- **CC(=O)OCC** (hypothetical ethyl acetate, not listed): Likely lower than hexylbenzene due to shorter chain, but our molecule has a much longer chain.

### Estimated Property:
Given the long aliphatic chain and the ester group, the property is likely in the range of **0.4 to 0.7**. Splitting the difference and considering the chain length's positive contribution, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.55**

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.8889901046050626
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic rings with substituents**: The molecule contains two benzene rings, one substituted with a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a chlorine (Cl), and the other with two chlorines and a nitro group (N(=O)=O). 
   - Similar examples:
     - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (property: -0.5319338)
     - **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property: -0.54187477)
     - **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** (property: 0.65004066)
   - The presence of multiple electronegative substituents (Cl, NO2, OH) tends to increase the property value compared to simpler aromatic systems (e.g., **c1ccccc1** with -0.95314229).

2. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: This is a polar functional group that can increase the property value. 
   - Example with amide: **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (property: -0.67807854), but this is simpler than our target molecule.

3. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: This is a strongly electron-withdrawing group, which tends to increase the property value when combined with other polar features.
   - Example: **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property: -0.54187477), but our molecule has more polar groups.

4. **Combined effects**: The molecule has multiple polar groups (OH, Cl, NO2, amide) and aromatic rings. Comparing to similar complex molecules:
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property: 0.91577754) has an amide and chloro-substituted aromatics.
   - **CC2Nc1cc(Cl)c(cc1C(=O)N2c3ccccc3C)S(N)(=O)=O** (property: 2.05392358) has amide, chloro, and sulfonamide groups.
   - Our molecule is less complex than the second example but more polar than the first.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of:
- Two chloro-substituted aromatic rings,
- A hydroxyl group,
- An amide linkage,
- A nitro group,

the property value is likely higher than simpler chloro-aromatics (e.g., 0.65004066 for **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**) but lower than very complex polar molecules like the sulfonamide example (2.05392358). 

A reasonable estimate would be **~1.2 to 1.5**, leaning toward the higher end due to the nitro group's strong electron-withdrawing effect. 

### Final Predicted Value:
**1.35** (specific value within the expected range based on similar examples).

Iteration: 76
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 3.8796002793018975
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and electronegative atoms (e.g., Cl, S, P, O, N). The property tends to increase with:

1. **Presence of sulfur (S) and phosphorus (P)**: These atoms often contribute positively to the property (e.g., `CCSSCC` = 0.160, `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` = 2.780).
2. **Aromatic systems with halogens (Cl)**: Chlorinated aromatics show moderate to high values (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` = 1.140).
3. **Multiple functional groups**: Molecules with combinations of P=O/S, S, and aromatic rings tend to have higher values.

The target molecule:  
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**  

- Contains **two P=S groups** (highly contributory, similar to the highest example with P=S at 2.780).  
- **Two aromatic rings linked by sulfur (S)**, which is also contributory.  
- **Multiple oxygen and sulfur atoms**, enhancing the property further.  

Given the structural similarity to `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (2.780) but with even more P=S and S linkages, the property should be **higher**.  

### Predicted property value: **~3.2**  
(Note: Without a clear definition of the property, this is an empirical estimate based on the trend of increasing values with P/S complexity.)  

---  
**Rationale for higher value**:  
- The molecule has **two P=S groups** (vs. one in the 2.780 example).  
- **Biphenyl-like sulfur bridge** adds complexity (cf. `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` = 1.140).  
- No Cl atoms, but the P=S and S linkages dominate the trend.  

Thus, **3.2** is a reasonable extrapolation from the given data.

To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2**: Property = **0.60017641**
     - This molecule has a nitro group attached to a phenyl ring, similar to our target molecule, and the property is positive (~0.60).
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: Property = **-0.56753556**
     - Here, the nitro group is attached to a phenyl ring without an additional hydroxyl group, and the property is negative (~-0.57).
   - **Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**: Property = **-0.66818433**
     - An amino group (NH2) instead of a nitro group, but still aromatic, and the property is negative.

2. **Presence of Hydroxyl Group (OH)**:
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = **-0.28844818**
     - A hydroxyl group on a chlorinated phenyl ring, property is slightly negative.
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O**: Property = **-0.61903469**
     - Hydroxyl group on a phenyl ring with an amide, property is negative.

3. **Combined OH and NO2 on Phenyl Ring**:
   - Our target molecule has both a hydroxyl group and a nitro group on the phenyl ring. From the examples, the nitro group tends to increase the property (e.g., from ~-0.57 to ~0.60 when combined with other substituents), while the hydroxyl group alone tends to decrease it.
   - The molecule **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (property = 0.60017641) is structurally similar to our target, but with additional chloro substituents. The nitro and hydroxyl combination here gives a positive property.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Nitro groups tend to increase the property (especially when combined with other substituents).
- Hydroxyl groups alone tend to decrease the property, but in combination with nitro, the effect is less clear.
- The closest analog is **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (property = 0.60017641), but our target lacks the chloro substituents, which might slightly reduce the property.

Thus, the property for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is likely slightly lower than 0.60017641 but still positive. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property: 0.45** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends). 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. The value is likely in the range of **0.4 to 0.6**.

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 2.650527271930838
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Given Molecule:
**OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O**

This is a complex carbohydrate (likely an oligosaccharide or polysaccharide fragment) with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and ether (C-O-C) linkages. Key features:
1. Highly oxygenated (many -OH groups).
2. No aromatic rings or conjugated systems.
3. No halogens (Cl, Br, I), sulfur, or nitrogen.
4. Polar and hydrophilic due to extensive hydrogen bonding potential.

### Observations from Examples:
1. **Highly oxygenated molecules** (e.g., sugars or polyols) tend to have **negative or low positive property values**:
   - `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (a hexose sugar) has a value of **-0.54677757**.
   - `COc1ccccc1O` (a simple aromatic with two -OH/-OCH3) has **-0.6739339**.
2. **Large aliphatic chains** (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`) have **positive values (1.53626606)**, but this is likely due to hydrophobicity, not polarity.
3. The given molecule is **much larger and more polar** than the sugar example above, but polarity dominates over size here.

### Prediction:
The molecule is **extremely polar and hydrophilic**, similar to the hexose sugar but larger. The additional hydroxyl groups and ether linkages will further increase polarity, but the size may offset this slightly. 

Given the hexose sugar example (`-0.54677757`), this larger molecule should have a **slightly more negative or similar value** due to increased polarity but balanced by size. 

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.65** (approximate, likely between -0.5 and -0.8 based on the examples). 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an educated guess based on the trend that **highly oxygenated, polar molecules** in the examples have **negative values**. If the property is something like **logP (hydrophobicity)**, this would make sense (very hydrophilic = negative logP). If it's another property, the interpretation may differ. 

For this specific case, assuming hydrophobicity/logP:  
**Final prediction: -0.65** (likely in the range -0.6 to -0.7).

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -1.2270198015913538
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, aromatics):**
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (long aliphatic chain with -OH): **1.37173742**
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (even longer aliphatic chain with -OH): **2.00311681**
   - **CCCC(=O)C** (ketone): **-0.84168938**
   - **CCC(C)C(=O)C** (branched ketone): **-0.66459996**
   - **CCCCCC=O** (aldehyde): **-0.59491558**
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32** (polyaromatic): **0.23190805**
   - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (large polyaromatic): **1.76772471**
   - **CC#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (aromatic with nitriles): **-0.62711318**
   - **CCC#C** is a simple alkyne (no functional groups).

2. **Polar Functional Groups:**
   - Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., -OH, -O-, -C=O) tend to increase the property value if the molecule is large (e.g., steroids or long chains). Small polar molecules (e.g., **CC(C)OC=O**: **-1.01131029**) have lower values.
   - Nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**) and halogens (Cl, F, Br) generally decrease the property value (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: **-0.53269516**).

3. **Alkynes:**
   - The only alkyne in the examples is **CC#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (property: **-0.62711318**), but this also includes aromatic rings and nitriles, which complicate the interpretation.
   - **CCC#C** is a simpler alkyne, so its property value should be compared to small hydrocarbons like **CCCC** (not in examples, but similar to **CCCC=O**: **-0.59491558**).

4. **Size and Branching:**
   - Small, linear hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCC(O)CCC**: **-0.32643131**) tend to have moderately negative values.
   - Branching (e.g., **CCC(C)C(=O)C**: **-0.66459996**) slightly lowers the value compared to linear analogs.

### Prediction for **CCC#C**:
- **CCC#C** is a small, linear alkyne with no polar functional groups. 
- Compared to similar small molecules:
  - **CCCC=O**: **-0.59491558** (aldehyde)
  - **CCCC(=O)C**: **-0.84168938** (ketone)
  - **CC#Cc1ccccc1C#N**: **-0.62711318** (complex alkyne)
- The triple bond in **CCC#C** is less polar than a carbonyl but more polar than a pure alkane. 
- Given the lack of polar groups, the value should be slightly negative but not as low as ketones/aldehydes.

### Estimated Property Value:
A reasonable prediction for **CCC#C** is **-0.45**. This aligns with:
- Small hydrocarbons typically having values between **-0.3** and **-0.6**.
- The triple bond introducing slight polarity but not as much as oxygen-containing groups.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCC#C** is **-0.45**.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 1.9721855527185752
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P=S)**: This functional group appears in some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** with a value of **2.78058575** and **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** with **2.31484418**). The presence of P=S tends to correlate with higher property values, likely due to its polarizable and electron-rich nature.
2. **Aromatic ring with multiple chlorine substitutions**: The **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** moiety resembles examples like **Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (value **0.60017641**) and **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl** (value **-0.34497364**). Multiple chlorines increase hydrophobicity and polarizability, but the exact effect depends on substitution patterns.
3. **Ethoxy (CCO-) and ethyl (CC-) groups**: These are relatively neutral contributors unless combined with other features (e.g., **CCCCOCCCC** has a value of **-0.11485406**).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog in the given examples is **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (value **2.78058575**), which also has P=S and a chloroaromatic ring. However, our molecule lacks the additional **SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)** moiety, which likely contributes to the very high value in that case.
- Another relevant example is **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** (value **2.31484418**), which has P=S and ester groups. Our molecule is simpler but retains the P=S and chloroaromatic components.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the presence of P=S and a tri-chlorinated aromatic ring, but without additional polar or complex substituents, the property value is expected to be **lower than the highest examples** but still **significantly positive**. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**1.75**  

This estimate balances the contributions from the phosphorothioate group (raising the value) and the chloroaromatic system (moderate contribution) while accounting for the absence of additional polar groups seen in the highest-valued examples.

### Final Answer:
**1.75**

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.6360997601778595
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains**: 
   - **C=C**: -1.584 (very low, likely due to minimal functionalization).
   - **CC(C)C**: -1.066 (branched alkane, slightly higher than C=C).
   - **CCCCCCC**: -0.358 (longer chain, less negative).

2. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Bare or lightly substituted aromatics (e.g., **c1ccccc1**) tend to have values around -0.5 to -0.7 (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1Cl**: -0.549).
   - Substitution with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens) slightly increases the value (e.g., **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**: -0.535).

3. **Polar or Functionalized Groups**:
   - **Amides (C(=O)N)**: Often increase the property (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1**: 0.181).
   - **Nitro (NO2)**: Strongly increases (e.g., **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: -0.659, but note conflicting trends; likely depends on context).
   - **Hydroxy (OH)**: Can increase or decrease (e.g., **Cc1ccc(O)cc1C**: -0.548).

4. **Complex or Conjugated Systems**:
   - Extended conjugation or fused rings increase the value (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43**: 1.141).
   - Aromatic systems with multiple substituents or heteroatoms (e.g., **O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23**: 0.424).

5. **Hydrazides (C(=O)NN)**:
   - The molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1** contains a pyridine ring (heteroaromatic) and a hydrazide group (**C(=O)NN**). 
   - Hydrazides are polar and can form hydrogen bonds, likely increasing the property value compared to simple aromatics.
   - Similar molecules with amides or polar groups (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)N...**) have values around 0.1–0.5.

### Prediction for **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**:
- The pyridine ring with a hydrazide substituent is more polar and functionalized than simple aromatics but less conjugated than fused polycyclic systems.
- Expected value: **Between 0.2 and 0.6**, leaning toward the higher end due to the hydrazide group's polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

### Final Prediction:
**0.45** (specific value based on comparable examples like **COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1**: 0.453 and **N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: 0.024, adjusted upward for the hydrazide group). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1** is:  
**0.45** (approximate).

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 3.290013083691201
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: This is a notable functional group. In the examples, molecules with phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**) have relatively high property values (e.g., **1.2077516**). This suggests that the P(=S) group contributes positively to the property.

2. **Thioether Linkage (SCC(=O))**: The presence of sulfur (thioether) is also significant. Sulfur-containing groups in the examples (e.g., **CCS** with **-1.09802698**) are not always positive, but when combined with other polar or bulky groups, the effect can vary. Here, it is part of a larger polar/charged system.

3. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: Amides are polar and can contribute to higher property values, especially when part of a larger functionalized system (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** with **-0.7678568**, but this is a simple amide; more complex amides like in **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** have **0.91577754**).

4. **Cyclic Structure (N1CCCCC1C)**: A piperidine-like ring with substitution. Bulky/aliphatic rings alone don't necessarily increase the property value much, but in combination with other polar groups, they can contribute to higher values.

5. **Alkyl Chains (CCCO and OCCC)**: These are neutral contributors unless they are very long or branched, which doesn't seem to be the case here.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog in the examples is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** with a property value of **1.2077516**. This molecule has a P(=S) group, aromatic nitro groups, and an aromatic system. Our molecule lacks aromaticity but has a P(=S) group, a thioether, and an amide, which are similarly polar/bulky.
- Another relevant example is **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** with **0.91577754**, which has an amide and aromatic systems. Our molecule is less aromatic but has the P(=S) group compensating for that.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of the **P(=S)** group (strong positive contributor), the **amide**, and the **thioether**, the property value is likely in the **higher range** but not as extreme as some of the very large or polyhalogenated molecules (e.g., **1.5915385** or **2.77077322**). 

A reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1 (1.2077516)** but not as high as **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2 (0.91577754)** because our molecule lacks aromaticity but has more polar/bulky groups. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 1.25** (with an estimated range of 1.20 to 1.30 based on the structural similarities and contributions). 

Thus, the specific predicted value is:  
**CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C ≈ 1.25**

Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.14741229893186997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCC** (octane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (only C and H):**
   - **C/C1CCCCC1\C** (cyclohexane with two methyl groups): -0.19358007
   - **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol): -0.31194093
   - **CCCC/C=C/C** (unsaturated hydrocarbon): -0.52126251
   - **CCCCCC1CCCC1** (cyclohexane with a hexyl chain): 0.28093151
   - **c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl with alcohol): 0.16520586
   - **c1ccsc1** (thiophene): -0.77879168

   Hydrocarbons without functional groups tend to have negative property values, with more negative values for simpler or less substituted hydrocarbons.

2. **Chain Length and Branching:**
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCO**) have more negative values than shorter ones (e.g., **CCC(O)CC**: -0.7473509).
   - Branching reduces the magnitude of the property value (e.g., **CC(C)CCO**: -0.79353943 vs. **CCC(C)C**: likely more negative).

3. **Octane (CCCCCCCC):**
   - This is a straight-chain alkane with no functional groups or branching.
   - Comparing to similar molecules:
     - **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol): -0.31194093 (presence of -OH increases value slightly compared to pure hydrocarbon).
     - **CCCC/C=C/C**: -0.52126251 (unsaturated hydrocarbon, likely more negative than saturated).
     - **CCCCCC1CCCC1**: 0.28093151 (cyclic structure increases value).
   - Pure alkanes like octane are expected to have more negative values than alcohols or cyclic structures.

### Prediction:
Given that octane is a straight-chain alkane with no functional groups or unsaturation, its property value should be more negative than **CCCCCCCO** (-0.31194093) but less negative than highly unsaturated or very small hydrocarbons (e.g., **ClCCBr**: -0.66249147). 

A reasonable estimate is slightly more negative than **CCCC/C=C/C** (-0.52126251) but not as extreme as small halogenated compounds. 

**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCC: -0.65** (approximate, likely between -0.6 and -0.7). 

For specificity, I will predict:  
**-0.65000000** (aligning with trends for straight-chain alkanes). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.65000000**

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 1.9949330196741304
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups such as carbonyls (C=O), hydroxyls (OH), halogens, and aromatic systems. The property tends to increase with the presence of multiple functional groups, especially oxygen-containing ones, and decreases with simpler, non-polar structures (e.g., alkanes).

Let's analyze the target molecule:  
**CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**

1. **Structural features**:  
   - **Steroid-like framework** (multiple fused rings, similar to some high-value examples like `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` with property **1.93839518**).  
   - **Two oxygen-containing groups**: A carbonyl (C=O) and a hydroxyl (OH).  
   - **Additional alkyne (C#C) group**, which adds some polarity but is less impactful than oxygen.  
   - The molecule is more complex than most examples, with 4 fused rings and multiple substituents.  

2. **Comparison to similar examples**:  
   - `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` (1.938) has 1 carbonyl and 1 hydroxyl.  
   - `CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO` (2.474) has 2 carbonyls, 2 hydroxyls, and a fluorine.  
   - The target molecule has 1 carbonyl, 2 hydroxyls (one explicitly shown as `O`, another implied by `12O`), and an alkyne. Its complexity is between these two.  

3. **Prediction**:  
   - The alkyne may slightly reduce the property compared to oxygenated analogs, but the two hydroxyls and carbonyl should push it toward the higher end.  
   - A reasonable estimate is **~2.1 to 2.3**.  

**Final predicted property value**: **2.186** (interpolated based on similar structures).  

*Note: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, bioactivity), this is an empirical estimate based on trends in the data.*

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 4.004088411925497
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule requires analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Structural Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings (e.g., `c1cc...`), which are also present in many of the examples. Aromaticity alone does not strongly correlate with high or low values, but substitution patterns matter.
2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - Multiple ethers (`OC`, `COC`), alcohols (`O`), and esters (`COC=O`). These are polar and can hydrogen bond, which may lower the property value (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` has -0.693).
   - Fused oxygenated rings (e.g., `OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O`) are highly polar and resemble sugar-like moieties, which typically reduce the property value.
3. **Size and Complexity**:
   - The molecule is large and polycyclic (e.g., `C6C2C...C7cc5OCOc5cc67`), similar to the last example in the list (`C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21`), which has a high value (3.626). However, that example lacks the extensive oxygenation seen here.
4. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Highly oxygenated molecules (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1`) have very low values (-1.011).
   - Large polycyclic systems with fewer polar groups (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45`) have values around 1.138–1.178.
   - The given molecule is a hybrid: large and polycyclic but heavily oxygenated. This likely suppresses the property value compared to purely aromatic systems.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the dominance of oxygenated functional groups (ethers, alcohols, esters) and the lack of strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `NO2`, `SO2`) or extended conjugated systems, the property value is expected to be **moderate but on the lower side**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**0.85** (with uncertainty ±0.2).  

This balances the size/complexity (which would increase the value) against the polar oxygen groups (which decrease it). It aligns with examples like `Cc1c(C)c2c3ccccc3ccc2c4ccccc14` (1.178) but adjusted downward for oxygenation.

*Note: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, polarizability, etc.), this is an empirical prediction based on trends in the data.*

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.6930544818997161
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends based on structural features and substituents. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol): -0.68639326  
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (another nitrophenol): -0.68639326  
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (same as above): -0.68387487  
     Phenols with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro) have strongly negative values (~ -0.68 to -0.69).

   - **Oc1ccccc1** (phenol itself, not in the list, but derivatives suggest phenols are negative unless heavily substituted).

2. **Chlorinated Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene): -0.25356199  
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): 1.34367315  
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl): 0.32586144  
     Chlorine substituents tend to increase the property value compared to phenol/nitro, but the effect depends on the number and position.

3. **Combined Phenol + Chloro**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is a phenol with a single chloro substituent. The chloro is less electron-withdrawing than nitro but more than alkyl groups.  
   - Compared to **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (-0.68), the chloro derivative should be less negative (since Cl is less electron-withdrawing than NO₂).  
   - Compared to **Clc1ccccc1I** (-0.25356199), the OH group is more electron-donating than I, but the property is likely still negative.

4. **Similar Structures**:
   - **Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I** (diiodo-cyanophenol): 0.26221121 (positive due to heavy halogens and cyano).  
   - **Oc1ccccc1** (phenol, hypothetical): Likely more negative than -0.68 (since NO₂ makes it less negative than plain phenol).  

### Prediction:
For **Oc1ccccc1Cl**, the property value is expected to be between the nitro-phenol (-0.68) and chloroiodobenzene (-0.25). The OH group dominates, making it negative, but the Cl pulls it toward less negative values.  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.45** (intermediate between -0.68 and -0.25).  

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is **-0.45**.  

*(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples. The actual value may vary slightly, but it should fall in this range.)*

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 0.45446663459592823
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Alkyne group (C#C)**: This is a relatively nonpolar and rigid functional group. In the given examples, molecules with rigid or nonpolar groups (e.g., aromatic rings, alkanes) tend to have lower property values unless balanced by other polar or complex features.
2. **Chlorine substituents (Cl)**: Chlorine atoms are electronegative and can increase polarity. In the examples, molecules with multiple Cl atoms (e.g., ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, property = 0.700) tend to have higher property values than non-halogenated analogs.
3. **Ester/amide group (OC(=O)N)**: This is a polar and hydrogen-bonding functional group. Molecules with amides or esters (e.g., COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC, property = -0.128) often have moderate property values, but the effect depends on the rest of the structure.
4. **Aromatic ring with Cl substitution (c1cccc(Cl)c1)**: This adds polarity and bulk. Compare to Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (property = 1.344), where multiple Cl substitutions significantly increase the property value.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule has two Cl atoms, an alkyne, and an amide/ester group. It is less halogenated than the highly chlorinated examples (e.g., property = 1.721 for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl) but more polar than simple aromatics (e.g., c1ccccc1, property = -0.953).
- The amide/ester group is similar to O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (property = 1.994), but our molecule lacks the second aromatic ring and has fewer polar groups.

### Estimated Property:
Given the balance of moderately polar groups (two Cl atoms, one amide) and the alkyne's nonpolar rigidity, the property value is likely in the **low to mid-positive range**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.65**  

This is based on:
- Similarity to ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl (property = 0.700), but with fewer Cl atoms and an added polar amide.
- Higher than simple aromatics but lower than highly halogenated or multi-ring systems.

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 1.3056652438210883
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a central oxygen (O) connected to three aromatic rings:
   - A chlorinated phenyl ring: **c1ccc(Cl)cc1**
   - A pyrimidine-like ring (heterocyclic with N atoms): **c2cncnc2**
   - Another chlorinated phenyl ring: **c3ccccc3Cl**

2. **Substituents**:
   - Two chlorine atoms (electron-withdrawing) on the phenyl rings.
   - A heterocyclic ring (**c2cncnc2**) with nitrogen atoms, which can contribute to polarity and hydrogen bonding potential.

3. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is moderately large (3 aromatic rings) and polar due to the O, Cl, and N atoms.
   - The presence of multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms suggests some degree of hydrophobicity but also polar interactions.

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and polar substituents (e.g., Cl, N, O) tend to have property values in the range of **0.5 to 1.5** in the given dataset. Examples:
  - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: 1.296 (similar chlorinated aromatic systems).
  - **ClC2=C(Cl)C3(Cl)C1C=CCC1C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl**: 1.171 (highly chlorinated, rigid structure).
  - **CN(C=Nc1ccc(C)cc1C)C=Nc2ccc(C)cc2C**: 1.321 (aromatic with polar N groups).

- The pyrimidine-like ring (**c2cncnc2**) may slightly lower the value compared to purely phenyl systems due to its heterocyclic nature (similar to **Nc1nc[nH]n1**, which has a very low value, but here it's balanced by the aromatic rings).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of aromaticity, chlorine substituents, and the heterocyclic ring, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: 0.95**  

This aligns with similar molecules in the dataset that combine aromaticity, halogens, and polar heteroatoms.

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.7564943627345757
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - Molecules with **aliphatic aldehydes (e.g., CCCCC=O)** tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.5949 for CCCCCC=O).
   - **Esters (e.g., CCCC(=O)OCC)** also tend to have negative values (e.g., -0.5471 for CCCC(=O)OCC).
   - The presence of a formyl group (HC=O) or ester linkage generally decreases the property value.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCCBr, -0.4919) tend to have moderately negative values.
   - Branching or cyclic structures can slightly increase the value (e.g., C1CCCCCCC1, -0.1113).

3. **Functional Groups**:
   - Nitro groups (NO2) and aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups often increase the value (e.g., positive values for many nitroaromatics).
   - Halogens (Cl, Br) can have variable effects but often decrease the value (e.g., ClC=C, -1.3476).

4. **Specific Examples Similar to CCCCOC=O**:
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate): -0.5471
   - **CCCCC=O** (hexanal): -0.5949
   - **CCOc1ccc(NC(N)=O)cc1**: -0.1054 (ether linkage but with additional polar groups).

### Analysis of CCCCOC=O:
- This is **butyl formate**, an ester with a formyl group (HC=O) and a butyl chain.
- Esters with simple aliphatic chains (like CCCC(=O)OCC) have values around **-0.5 to -0.6**.
- The formyl group (HC=O) might further decrease the value slightly compared to other esters.
- The butyl chain is similar to examples like CCCCBr (-0.4919) or CCCC(=O)OCC (-0.5471).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to **CCCC(=O)OCC (-0.5471)** and the slightly more polar formyl group, I predict the property for **CCCCOC=O** to be slightly more negative, around:

**-0.65** (approximate, likely between -0.6 and -0.7). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.65** (estimated based on trends in the data).
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -1.1200085114355047
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Alkanes**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane): Property value = **-0.90954872**
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene): Property value = **0.06215104**
   - **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(NC=O)...** (a highly chlorinated complex molecule): Property value = **1.49702879**

   The presence of chlorine atoms tends to decrease the property value for small alkanes (e.g., ClCCCl is very negative), but for larger or aromatic systems, the effect is less pronounced or even reversed.

2. **Small Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - **ClCCCl** (-0.90954872) is structurally similar to **ClCCl** (dichloromethane), but with one fewer carbon. Since **ClCCCl** is already quite negative, **ClCCl** (being smaller and simpler) might have an even lower (more negative) value.

3. **Comparison with Other Small Molecules**:
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane): Property value = **-0.91280264**
   - **CNN** (methylhydrazine): Property value = **-1.46301265**
   - **CCC** (propane): Property value = **-0.98925148**

   Small halogenated or simple aliphatic molecules tend to have negative property values, with more electronegative atoms (like Cl or Br) further reducing the value.

### Prediction for ClCCl:
Given that:
- **ClCCCl** (two carbons, two chlorines) has a value of **-0.90954872**.
- **ClCCl** (one carbon, two chlorines) is smaller and more electronegative, so its value should be more negative.

Comparing with **CCBr** (-0.91280264), which is similar in size but with bromine instead of chlorine, **ClCCl** might be slightly more negative due to chlorine's higher electronegativity.

Thus, a reasonable estimate for **ClCCl** is:
**-1.05** (slightly more negative than ClCCCl and CCBr, but not as extreme as CNN).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **ClCCl** is **-1.05**.

Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.5458505010912911
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - **Oc1ccccc1** (phenol) has a property value of **-0.84009137**.
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol) has a value of **-0.84009137** (same as phenol, suggesting hydroxyl groups dominate).
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (a methyl-substituted phenol) has a value of **-0.15128359**, indicating that alkyl substitution reduces the negative impact of the hydroxyl group.

2. **Methyl Substitution**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene) is not explicitly listed, but **Brc1ccccc1** (bromobenzene) has **-0.57740248**, suggesting aromatic rings with simple substituents tend to have negative values unless strongly polar/functionalized.
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1** (xylene-like) is not listed, but alkylated aromatics generally have less negative values than bare phenol.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is a methyl-substituted phenol (similar to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** but with fewer methyl groups). 
   - The hydroxyl group pulls the value down, while methyl groups push it up. With one hydroxyl and two methyl groups, we expect a value less negative than phenol but more negative than heavily alkylated phenols.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (-0.15128359), but with fewer methyl groups, the value should be slightly more negative. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.30** (approximately between phenol and the methyl-substituted phenol examples). 

However, looking more closely, **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** has two methyl groups and is at -0.151, while **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** has one methyl and one hydroxyl. The hydroxyl dominates, so the value should be closer to phenol but less extreme. 

A refined estimate is: **-0.45**. 

But comparing to **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (-0.84) and **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (-0.15), a single-methyl phenol might be around **-0.50**. 

Given the data, the most consistent prediction is:  
**-0.35**. 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O: -0.35** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.7279493451601973
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the given molecule, I will predict the property value for:

**Molecule:**  
`Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`  

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Heavy Chlorination**: The molecule is highly chlorinated, similar to `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl` (property = 0.939) and `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` (property = 1.138). Chlorination tends to increase the property value, especially when multiple Cl atoms are present on aromatic rings.
2. **Biphenyl Core**: The molecule consists of two benzene rings linked directly (biphenyl-like structure), similar to `c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24` (property = 0.828) and `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` (property = 1.141). The biphenyl motif generally contributes positively to the property.
3. **Symmetry**: The molecule is symmetric and fully chlorinated, which is comparable to the second example above (property = 1.138), but with slightly fewer Cl atoms (5 Cl here vs. 7 Cl in the example with 1.138).

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl` (5 Cl atoms, less symmetric): **0.939**  
- `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` (7 Cl atoms, symmetric): **1.138**  
- `Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br` (4 Br atoms, symmetric): **0.555**  

This molecule has 5 Cl atoms and a symmetric biphenyl core. The property value is likely between the two chlorinated examples above but closer to the higher one due to the biphenyl structure.

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.05**  

This is a reasonable estimate given the trends in the data:  
- Highly chlorinated + symmetric aromatic systems trend toward higher values (~0.9 to ~1.4).  
- The biphenyl core adds to the value compared to monocyclic chlorinated aromatics.  
- Fewer Cl atoms than the 1.138 example but more than the 0.939 example justifies a value slightly below 1.138.  

Thus, **1.05** is a confident prediction.

Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -1.0095348178854373
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isobutylene or 2-methylpropene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Alkenes**:
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): Property value = **0.10909181**
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane): Property value = **-0.1474123**
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): Property value = **-0.14644896**
   - **CC(=O)C** (acetone): Not directly given, but carbonyls tend to increase polarity/property value.
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a branched alkene, similar to nonene but with more branching.

2. **Branching Effects**:
   - Branching generally reduces the property value slightly compared to linear chains (e.g., octane vs. branched alkanes).
   - Alkenes (C=C) tend to have slightly higher property values than alkanes (compare nonene vs. octane).

3. **Small Alkenes**:
   - **COC(=O)C=C** (methyl acrylate): Property value = **-1.15795334**, but this is heavily influenced by the ester group.
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a pure hydrocarbon with no polar groups, so its value should be closer to small alkanes/alkenes.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)=CC3C...**: A complex branched alkene with other functional groups has a high value, but this is not directly comparable.
   - **CC=C(C)C** is simpler and should have a value closer to small hydrocarbons like **CCCCCCCC** or **CCCCCCCCC=C**.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **CCCCCCCC** (octane) = **-0.1474123**
- **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene) = **0.10909181**
- **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane) = **-0.14644896**

The molecule **CC=C(C)C** is a branched alkene. Branching reduces the property slightly compared to linear alkenes, but the double bond increases it compared to alkanes. Since nonene (linear alkene) is ~0.109 and octane (linear alkane) is ~-0.147, a branched alkene like isobutylene should be between these values but closer to the alkane due to its small size and branching.

### Estimated Property Value:
A reasonable estimate for **CC=C(C)C** is **-0.10 to -0.15**. Averaging the trends, I predict:

**Predicted property value: -0.12**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or experimental data would be needed.)
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -1.1200085114355047
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property of **ClCCl** (dichloromethane):

1. **Chlorine Substitution**: Molecules with chlorine atoms tend to have negative property values, especially when they are small and lack other functional groups. For example:
   - **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (tetrachloroethylene): -0.735
   - **Oc1cccc(Cl)c1** (4-chlorophenol): -0.696
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (2,5-dichlorophenol): -0.492

2. **Size and Complexity**: Smaller molecules with fewer heavy atoms (like ClCCl) generally have more negative values compared to larger chlorinated compounds. For instance:
   - **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (4 chlorines, -0.735) is more negative than **Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (8 chlorines, +1.547).

3. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (tetrachloroethylene, -0.735) is a small chlorinated hydrocarbon with 4 chlorines.
   - **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) has only 2 chlorines and is even smaller, so its property value should be less negative than tetrachloroethylene but still negative.

4. **Estimated Value**: Given the trends, **ClCCl** is expected to have a property value between **-0.4 and -0.7**. A reasonable interpolation suggests a value around **-0.55**.

### Predicted Property for ClCCl: **-0.55**

This aligns with the observed pattern where small, highly chlorinated molecules have moderately negative property values.

Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.2859297943322667
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (property: -0.28844818): This is a trichlorophenol (hydroxyl group + three chlorines on the benzene ring). The property value is moderately negative.
   - **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** (property: 0.17407714): A tribromobenzene (no hydroxyl group). The property is slightly positive, suggesting halogens alone may increase the value compared to hydroxylated chlorinated aromatics.

2. **Hydroxyl Group Impact**:
   - Phenols (e.g., **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(O)cc1**, property: -0.42737241) tend to have negative property values unless other functional groups (e.g., nitro, sulfonyl) are present to offset this.

3. **Chlorine Substitution**:
   - More chlorines generally decrease the property value when combined with a hydroxyl group (as seen in **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** vs. non-hydroxylated halogens like **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1**).

### Target Molecule: **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**
This is a trichlorophenol (same as **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** in the examples but with a slightly different substitution pattern). The property value for the given trichlorophenol is **-0.28844818**. 

Since the substitution pattern (2,4,6-trichlorophenol vs. 2,3,6-trichlorophenol) is similar and the functional groups are identical, the property value should be very close. Minor positional differences in chlorine substitution may slightly affect the value, but not significantly.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.29** (approximately the same as the given trichlorophenol example). 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, dipole moment, etc.), this is based on the assumption that the property is influenced by halogenation and hydroxyl groups in a consistent way across the dataset. The value is likely in the range of **-0.25 to -0.35**. For precision, we can use the nearly identical example's value:  
**-0.288** (rounded to **-0.29**). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.29**

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 4.004088411925497
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, functional groups, and size. The molecule in question is highly complex, with multiple functional groups (ethers, alcohols, carbonyls, and cyclic structures) and a large size. 

Breaking it down:
1. **Size and branching**: The molecule is very large with multiple rings and branches, which typically increases the property value (e.g., compare `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` with a value of 3.64086401).
2. **Functional groups**: It contains multiple polar groups (ethers, alcohols, carbonyls), which can contribute to higher values (e.g., `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` has a value of 1.18471912).
3. **Aromaticity and conjugation**: The presence of aromatic rings and conjugated systems (e.g., fused rings) can also increase the value (e.g., `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5cccc6c(c1)c2c3c4c56` has a value of 1.45455341).

Given these observations, the molecule's property value is likely to be **high**, similar to other large, polar, and conjugated molecules in the examples. 

### Predicted property value: **2.5** (approximate, based on the trend of large, polar, and complex molecules in the dataset). 

This is an educated estimate given the lack of a clear numerical pattern or explicit property definition (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.). If more context were provided (e.g., the property is logP), the prediction could be refined further.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.4754030430300521
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like heterocycle** with a **thiomethyl (CS)** group, a **carbonyl (=O)**, and an **amino (NH)** group. It also has a bulky **tert-butyl (C(C)(C)C)** substituent.
   - The presence of **S**, **N**, and **=O** suggests moderate polarity.
   - The **tert-butyl group** adds hydrophobicity but also steric bulk.

2. **Similar Examples**:
   - **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property = **0.80840217**): This has a similar **heterocycle with S, N, and =O**, plus a **tert-butyl group**. The property is positive (~0.81).
   - **Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1** (property = **-0.735374**): This is a simpler uracil-like structure with **NH and =O**, but lacks the bulky group and S, leading to a negative value.
   - **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property = **-0.4697381**): This has **S and =O** but is smaller and less substituted, giving a moderately negative value.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Bulky alkyl groups (e.g., tert-butyl) tend to **increase the property value** (see the first example above).
   - **Sulfur and carbonyl groups** contribute to polarity but may not dominate over bulky hydrophobic groups.
   - The **NNCO fragment** is somewhat similar to the **NNCS** fragment in the first example, which had a high positive value.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property = **0.80840217**), but with a **slightly less polar thiomethyl (CS)** instead of a **thione (C=S)**, the property value might be **slightly lower**. However, the **tert-butyl group** and **heterocycle** still favor a positive value.

### Final Estimate:
**Predicted property value: ~0.65**  
(Rationale: Slightly less polar than the 0.81 example but still in the positive range due to bulky substituents and heterocycle.)

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - The molecule contains an ester group (**CCOC(=O)**) attached to a benzene ring (**c1ccccc1**). This is similar to the following examples:
     - **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C** (property: 0.89324354)
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2** (property: 2.1188706)
     - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (property: -0.33662541)
   - Esters (e.g., **CCOC(=O)**) tend to have property values in the range of **-0.3 to 0.9**, depending on other substituents.

2. **Benzene Ring Contribution**:
   - Simple benzene rings (e.g., **c1ccccc1**) often contribute negatively to the property (e.g., **Nc1ccccc1** has -0.86922829).
   - However, substitution with polar or electron-withdrawing groups (like esters) can increase the property value.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (two benzene rings linked by an oxygen) has a property of **-0.01465345**.
   - **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (benzene with carbonyl groups) has **-0.08480671**.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is structurally simpler than the above but shares features with **CCCC(=O)OCC** (property: -0.33662541).

4. **Prediction**:
   - The ester group (**CCOC(=O)**) is more polar than simple alkyl chains, likely increasing the property compared to pure hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCC** has -1.37406188).
   - The benzene ring alone would pull the value down, but the ester offsets this.
   - Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is slightly higher than **CCCC(=O)OCC** (-0.33662541) but lower than **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C** (0.89324354).

### Final Prediction:
The property value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is likely in the range of **-0.1 to 0.2**. A specific estimate based on the closest analogs is:

**Predicted property value: 0.042** (close to neutral, similar to other benzene derivatives with moderate polar substituents). 

However, reviewing the examples again, **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (a diphenyl ether) has a value of **-0.01465345**, and **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is somewhat similar but with an ester instead of an ether. Esters are more polar, so the value should be slightly higher. 

A refined estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.012** (very close to neutral but slightly positive due to the ester). 

Given the variability in the examples, the most plausible answer is:  
**0.012** (similar to other benzene derivatives with single polar substituents). 

However, since the exact trend isn't perfectly linear, another close match is **o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (a polycyclic aromatic) with **0.02042319**, suggesting small positive values for aromatic + polar groups. 

Thus, the final predicted value is:  
**0.020** (rounded to match the closest analog). 

But to be precise, let's average the closest analogs:  
- **CCCC(=O)OCC**: -0.336  
- **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: -0.014  
- **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**: -0.084  

Averaging these gives ~-0.14, but the ester in **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is less hindered than in **CCCC(=O)OCC**, so the value should be higher. Adjusting upward to **-0.05** seems reasonable. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest answer is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.05**. 

However, reviewing the examples again, **c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12** (a brominated polycyclic aromatic) has **0.0138635**, and **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is less polar than that, so a value closer to zero but slightly negative is plausible. 

Final answer:  
**Predicted property value: -0.02**. 

But to match the format of the given examples (many decimal places), we'll provide:  
**-0.019**. 

However, the most consistent estimate based on the closest structural analogs is:  
**-0.05**. 

Given the time spent deliberating, the final prediction is:  
**-0.05**. 

But to align with the examples like **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (-0.014), a better estimate is:  
**-0.01**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is:  
**-0.01**. 

However, the ester group likely increases the value slightly above pure aromatics, so a positive value is more plausible. Revisiting the examples:  
- **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**: -0.084 (two carbonyls)  
- **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**: one ester, so higher than -0.084 but lower than **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (-0.014).  

Thus, a compromise is:  
**-0.04**. 

After careful consideration, the most accurate prediction is:  
**-0.03**. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is **-0.03**.
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.13949632952630053
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Alkyl Halides (R-X):**
   - **CI (iodomethane):** Property value = -0.72775552
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl (polychlorinated biphenyl):** Property value = 0.524387
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O (complex chlorinated molecule):** Property value = 1.4142959
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (brominated aromatic):** Property value = 0.0138635

   Halogens (Cl, Br, I) tend to increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons, but the effect depends on the molecular context (e.g., aromatic vs. aliphatic, number of halogens).

2. **Linear Alkanes vs. Alkyl Halides:**
   - **CCCC (butane-like fragments in larger molecules):** Typically have negative property values (e.g., -0.39523674 for CCCC=O).
   - **CCCCCCC=C (heptene):** Property value = -0.31182778
   - **CCCCCCCO (heptanol):** Property value = -0.31194093

   Linear alkanes/alkenes/alcohols have negative property values, and adding a halogen (Br) would likely increase the value slightly compared to the pure hydrocarbon.

3. **Brominated vs. Chlorinated:**
   - Bromine is less electronegative than chlorine but more polarizable. In the given data, **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** has a slightly positive value (0.0138635), while **CI** has a more negative value (-0.72775552). This suggests that bromine in an aliphatic chain may have a less negative effect than iodine.

### Prediction for CCCCCCCBr:
- The closest analog in the data is **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol), which has a property value of **-0.31194093**. Replacing the -OH group with -Br would likely increase the property value slightly because halogens are less polar than -OH but still introduce some polarity.
- Another comparison is **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (brominated aromatic) with a value of **0.0138635**, but aliphatic bromides are less conjugated, so the effect would be smaller.
- **CI** (iodomethane) has a value of -0.72775552, but bromine is less electronegative than iodine, so the effect would be less negative.

Given these observations, the property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is expected to be slightly higher than **CCCCCCCO** but still negative. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.25** (between -0.31194093 for heptanol and 0.0138635 for brominated aromatic). 

However, looking at the trend for **CCCCCCC=C** (-0.31182778) and **CCCCCCCO** (-0.31194093), adding Br (which is more polarizable than a double bond or -OH) would likely push the value closer to zero but still negative. 

A more precise estimate based on the data would be:  
**-0.20** (slightly higher than the pure hydrocarbon/alkanol due to the polarizability of Br). 

But to match the granularity of the given data (e.g., values like -0.311, -0.696), I refine this to:  
**-0.28** (a compromise between the aliphatic and halogen effects). 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr: -0.28**
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -1.6067405018213043
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's a breakdown of the patterns:

1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CCC, CC#C, C=Cc1ccccc1)** tend to have negative property values, often between -0.5 and -1.5. The more carbon atoms or unsaturation (e.g., triple bonds), the more negative the value tends to be.

2. **Oxygen-containing small molecules (e.g., CCCCOC=O, OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O)** also tend to have negative values, but less so than pure hydrocarbons. The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups or carbonyls can moderate the negativity.

3. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) and complex aromatic systems with multiple functional groups** tend to push the property value into positive territory, especially if combined with other polar or conjugated systems.

4. **Very small or highly polar molecules (e.g., NC(=O)N, NC(N)=NC#N)** have strongly negative values, likely due to high polarity or hydrogen bonding.

### Prediction for **CO (formaldehyde)**:
- CO is a small, polar molecule with a carbonyl group (C=O). 
- Similar small polar molecules like **CCCCOC=O (-0.756)** and **COC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 (-0.485)** suggest that small carbonyl compounds tend to have negative values.
- However, CO is even simpler (just C=O), so its value should be more negative than these examples but less extreme than very small polar molecules like **NC(=O)N (-1.466)** or **NC(N)=NC#N (-1.270)**.

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for **CO** would be around **-1.0**. 

### Final predicted property value for **CO**: **-1.0** (approximate). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data.)
