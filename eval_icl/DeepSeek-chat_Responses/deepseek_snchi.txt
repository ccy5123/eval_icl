SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.9318941887606693
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I observe that the property value seems to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, and molecular size. 

For the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl decanoate), we can analyze its structure:
1. It has a long hydrocarbon chain (**CCCCCCCCC**), which is non-polar and hydrophobic. In the examples, long hydrocarbon chains (e.g., **CCCCCC**, **CCCCCCCC(C)O**) tend to have positive property values when combined with polar/functional groups.
2. It contains an ester group (**C(=O)OC**), which is polar but not as strongly polar as groups like hydroxyl (-OH) or amine (-NH2). Esters in the examples (e.g., **COC(=O)c1cccnc1**, **COC(=O)c1ccccc1OC2OC...**) have property values around **0.20576601** and **-0.25299774**, respectively, suggesting moderate influence.
3. The length of the hydrocarbon chain (10 carbons) is longer than most examples, but similar to **CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (property = **0.46185898**), which also has a long chain and ester group.

Given these observations, the property value for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is likely **positive and moderate**, similar to **CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** but slightly lower due to the shorter chain. 

### Predicted property value: **~0.45**  
(Approximating based on the closest example, **CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** with **0.46185898**).  

A refined estimate would place it around **0.45–0.48**, but given the data, **0.46** is a reasonable prediction.  

**Final answer: 0.46** (rounded from closest analogous example).

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 0.37321318128245085
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:**  
`Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2`  

This is a heterocyclic structure with:
1. A **chlorine substituent** (Cl) attached to an aromatic ring.  
2. A **lactam-like moiety** (`oc(=O)[nH]`) fused to the aromatic ring (resembling a benzoxazolone or similar heterocycle).  

### Observations from the training data:
- **Chlorinated aromatic compounds** tend to have property values that are **positive** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` has 0.781, `Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has 0.867).  
- **Heterocycles with carbonyl groups (C=O) and nitrogen** (e.g., `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)` has 0.918, `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1` has 0.579) also tend to have **positive values**.  
- The combination of **chlorine + heterocycle + carbonyl** suggests a **higher positive value**.  

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to high-value examples (chlorine + fused heterocycle + C=O), the predicted property value for `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2` is likely in the range of **0.8 to 0.95**.  

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: 0.89**  

This aligns with the trend that **chlorinated aromatic heterocycles with polar groups (C=O, NH)** exhibit strongly positive values in the given dataset.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.7908725006733414
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the dataset:
1. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - The molecule **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** has a nitro group attached to a heterocycle and a property value of **0.29526734**.
   - Nitro groups often contribute to moderate positive or negative values depending on the rest of the structure.

2. **Alkyl groups**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCCl**) tend to have negative values (e.g., **-0.83423418**).
   - Branched alkyl groups (e.g., **CCC(C)CC**) have a small positive value (**0.13374727**).

3. **Polarity and electronegativity**:
   - The nitro group is highly polar and electron-withdrawing, which can influence the property value.
   - In **CC(C)N(=O)=O**, the nitro group is attached to a branched alkyl group (isopropyl), which may slightly offset the polarity.

4. **Similar structures**:
   - **ClCC** (chloroethane) has a positive value (**0.75458642**), suggesting that polar substituents on small alkanes can increase the property.
   - **CCN2c1nc(C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23** (a nitro-containing heterocycle) has a value of **-0.49802898**, but this is more complex.

### Prediction for **CC(C)N(=O)=O**:
- The nitro group's polarity and the branched alkyl group's slight positive contribution suggest a value in the low-to-moderate positive range.
- Given the simplicity of the molecule (no aromaticity or additional functional groups), the value is likely closer to the nitro-heterocycle example (**0.29526734**) but slightly higher due to the alkyl group.

### Final predicted value:
**0.35** (estimated based on the balance between the nitro group's polarity and the branched alkyl group's influence). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data.)

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: -0.9321843661358735
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Steroid-like structure**: The molecule has a multi-ring steroid-like framework with a ketone (=O) and a hydroxyl (OH) group, similar to **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (property: **-0.43841703**). 
2. **Polar functional groups**: The presence of **C(=O)CO** (a ketone and a hydroxymethyl group) and **CC(O)** (a secondary alcohol) introduces polarity, which may lower the property value compared to purely hydrophobic structures.
3. **Ring strain and rigidity**: The fused ring system is rigid, which can influence the property. Rigid, hydrophobic structures with polar groups tend to have intermediate values (e.g., **-0.43841703** for a similar steroid).
4. **Comparison to examples**:
   - The closest analog is **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (property: **-0.43841703**), but our molecule has additional polar groups (OH and C(=O)CO), which may further reduce the value.
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC**, property: **-0.12660654**) tend to have less negative values than purely hydrophobic steroids.

### Prediction:
Given the steroid core and additional polar groups, the property value is likely slightly more negative than **-0.43841703** but less negative than highly hydrophobic/aliphatic molecules (e.g., **CCCCOC=O**, **-0.89390447**). 

**Predicted property value: -0.52**  
*(This is an estimate based on structural similarity and trends in the examples.)*  

### Rationale:
- The steroid core alone would suggest ~**-0.44**.
- The extra polar groups (OH and C(=O)CO) pull the value slightly lower (more negative).
- No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens) are present to significantly increase the value.  

Thus, **-0.52** is a reasonable interpolation.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.9058002880971616
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). Aromatic rings with electronegative substituents (e.g., F, Cl) appear in the examples with varying property values:
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` and `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` both have a value of **0.638**.
   - `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` has a value of **-0.177**, likely due to the strong electron-withdrawing effect of CF3.
   - `Fc1cccc(F)c1` (not explicitly given, but similar to dichlorobenzene) would likely have a positive contribution.

2. **Amide Groups**: The molecule has two amide linkages (`C(=O)NC(=O)`). Amides in the examples:
   - `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` has a value of **0.698** (thioamide, similar to amide).
   - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` has a value of **-0.843** (likely due to the pyridine ring and amide combination).
   Amides generally contribute positively unless paired with strongly electron-withdrawing groups.

3. **Chlorine Substituent**: The `Cl` on the second aromatic ring is similar to the dichlorobenzene examples (value **0.638**).

4. **Fluorine Substituents**: The two `F` atoms on the first ring are less electron-withdrawing than CF3 but still contribute to polarity. Compare to `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` (**-0.177**), but here the fluorine is directly on the ring, likely less negative.

5. **Overall Polarity**: The molecule is polar due to the amides and halogen substituents, but the exact balance depends on the interplay of these groups.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog is likely a combination of:
  - `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` (**0.698**) for the amide-thioamide-aromatic linkage.
  - `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (**0.638**) for the chloro-aromatic.
  - The fluorine substituents may slightly reduce the value compared to chlorine (less electron-withdrawing).

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value is likely **positive** and in the range of **0.5 to 0.7**, similar to the dichlorobenzene and amide-containing examples. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.65**

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 0.42142600395533714
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl propyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - Molecules with ether linkages tend to have moderately negative property values unless other strongly polar or functional groups are present.
   - Example: `CCOC(=O)CC` (ethyl propanoate, not a pure ether but contains -O-) has a value of **-0.89662554**.
   - Example: `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC` (triethyl phosphate, contains P=O and -O-) has **-0.60656528**.
   - Example: `OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O` (complex sugar-like ether) has **-0.78341863**.

2. **Hydrocarbon Chains**:
   - Simple alkanes or alkyl groups tend to have negative values unless branched or cyclic in ways that increase steric effects or polarity.
   - Example: `CCCCCC1CCCC1` (cyclohexylhexane) has **0.29446378** (cyclic + alkyl).
   - Example: `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (branched alcohol) has **0.91754841** (due to -OH and branching).
   - Example: `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` (branched alkane) has **-0.92705318**.

3. **Branching**:
   - Branched ethers or alcohols can shift the property toward more positive values if the branching introduces steric or polarity effects.
   - Example: `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (highly branched alcohol) has **0.91754841**.
   - Example: `CCCOC(C)C` is a branched ether (isopropyl group), which may slightly increase the property compared to linear ethers.

4. **Polarity**:
   - Ethers are polar but less so than alcohols or carbonyls. The property tends to be negative unless other groups dominate.

### Prediction for CCCOC(C)C:
- This is a **branched ether** (isopropyl propyl ether). 
- It lacks strongly polar groups (like -OH, C=O) but has a polar -O- linkage.
- Branching (isopropyl) may slightly increase the property compared to linear ethers like `CCOC(=O)CC` (-0.89662554), but not as much as alcohols or cyclic structures.
- From the examples, similar ethers or branched hydrocarbons have values in the range of **-0.6 to -0.8**.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, I predict the property value for **CCCOC(C)C** to be approximately:  
**-0.72** (moderately negative, reflecting the ether linkage and branching). 

---
**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value for **CCCOC(C)C** is **-0.72**.

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: -0.8583468136121697
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular features such as functional groups, halogens (Cl, Br, F), aromaticity, and overall polarity. Here's how I would approach predicting the property for the molecule:

**Molecule to predict:**  
`CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O`

### Key features of the molecule:
1. **Structure**: It is a substituted uracil-like heterocycle (dihydropyrimidine-2,4-dione) with:
   - Two carbonyl groups (C=O) at positions 2 and 4.
   - A bromine (Br) substituent on the ring.
   - An N-H group (hydrogen bond donor).
   - An ethyl and isopropyl substitution on the nitrogen (N-alkylation).
2. **Polarity**: The molecule is polar due to the C=O and N-H groups, but the alkyl groups and bromine add some hydrophobicity.
3. **Electron-withdrawing/donating effects**: The bromine is weakly electron-withdrawing, and the carbonyls are strongly electron-withdrawing.

### Observations from the training data:
- Molecules with multiple halogens (especially Cl or Br) and polar groups (C=O, N-H) tend to have negative property values (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` has -0.857, `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` has -0.824).
- Aromatic systems with fewer polar groups or halogens tend to have positive values (e.g., `c1ccoc1` has 0.663, `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has 0.638).
- The presence of Br in polar systems (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1`) gives a negative value (-0.824).
- N-alkylation (e.g., `CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1`) can sometimes lead to positive values if the rest of the molecule is less polar.

### Prediction:
This molecule has:
- Two strong electron-withdrawing C=O groups.
- A bromine substituent (electron-withdrawing).
- N-alkylation (reduces polarity slightly but not enough to outweigh the C=O and Br effects).
- No strongly electron-donating groups.

Given the strong polar character from the C=O and Br, and the similarity to other negative-valued molecules like `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (-0.824), I predict a **negative property value** in the range of **-0.7 to -0.9**.

### Specific predicted value:
A reasonable estimate is **-0.85**, similar to other polar, halogenated, and carbonyl-containing molecules in the dataset.

**Final answer:**  
Predicted property value: **-0.85**
==================================================
Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.6789159616487446
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: The molecule consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond (biphenyl). Aromatic systems with extended conjugation (e.g., polycyclic aromatics like **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67**) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.85979991). However, biphenyl is less conjugated than larger fused systems.
2. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (large fused aromatic): -0.85979991
   - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (aromatic with nitrogen): 0.2692054
   - **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (methyl-substituted naphthalene-like): -0.13294327
   - **C1CCc2ccccc2C1** (aromatic with aliphatic ring): -0.76924328

Biphenyl is less conjugated than fused polycyclic aromatics but more conjugated than single-ring systems. Its property value likely falls between these extremes.

### Prediction:
Given the examples, biphenyl (**c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2**) is expected to have a **moderately negative property value**, similar to smaller fused systems or aromatic systems with aliphatic components. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

This aligns with the trend where:
- Highly conjugated fused systems have more negative values (e.g., -0.86).
- Smaller or less conjugated aromatics (e.g., naphthalene-like: -0.13) are less negative.
- Biphenyl, with two separate rings, would fall in between. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the empirical trend in the given data.)

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.44087713133824996
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and analyzing the structural features of the molecule **CCCCS** (1-butanethiol), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Functional Group**: The molecule contains a **thiol group (-SH)**, which is polar but less polar than alcohols or amines. Thiols are somewhat similar to halides or simple alkanes in terms of their impact on the property.

2. **Chain Length**: The molecule has a **4-carbon alkyl chain**, which is relatively short. From the examples:
   - **CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2** (complex, polar, aromatic) has a value of **-0.91165411**.
   - **CCCC(=C)C** (branched alkene) has a value of **-0.93025717**.
   - **CCCCCC(C)C** (linear alkane) has a value of **-0.81451082**.
   - **CC(C)I** (branched alkyl iodide) has a value of **-0.56311301**.

3. **Comparison**:
   - Thiols are less polar than alcohols or amides but more polar than pure hydrocarbons. 
   - The property values for simple alkanes or slightly polar molecules tend to fall in the **negative range** (e.g., **-0.5 to -0.9**).
   - The presence of sulfur might slightly increase the value compared to pure alkanes but not as much as halogens or aromatic rings.

4. **Closest Analogues**:
   - **CC(C)I** (-0.56311301): Iodine is more polarizable than sulfur, but the structure is somewhat similar.
   - **CCCCCC(C)C** (-0.81451082): Pure hydrocarbon, longer chain.
   - **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (-0.80467746): Aromatic with halogens, but the value is still negative.

### Predicted Property Value for **CCCCS**:
Given the above reasoning, the value is likely in the range of **-0.6 to -0.8**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**-0.72** (specific predicted value). 

This reflects the moderate polarity of the thiol group combined with the short alkyl chain.

Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.8583954396526172
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with **hydrophobic alkyl chains (e.g., CCCC, CCC(C)C)** tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., `CCCC/C=C/C: 0.804`, `CCCC(=O)OCC: 0.664`).
   - Molecules with **polar groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -NO2, -NH2)** tend to have **negative property values** (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1: -0.881`, `NC(=O)c1cnccn1: -0.922`).
   - **Branched alkanes with -OH** (e.g., `CC(C)CC(C)O: 0.129`) have **moderately positive values**, while **branched alkanes without -OH** (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)C: -0.927`) have **strongly negative values**.

2. **Effect of -OH Group**:
   - The presence of an **-OH group** in a hydrophobic molecule often **increases the property value** compared to its non-hydroxylated counterpart (e.g., `CCCC(C)(O)CC: 0.609` vs. `CCC(C)(C)C: -0.927`).

3. **Specific Case for CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
   - This molecule is a **branched alkane with a terminal -OH group**, similar to `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (property value: `0.60873843`) and `CC(C)CC(C)O` (property value: `0.12868833`).
   - The **longer alkyl chain** in `CCCC(C)(C)CO` suggests a **more hydrophobic contribution**, but the **-OH group** adds polarity. Balancing these effects, the property value should be **moderately positive**.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (value: `0.609`) but with a slightly less hydrophobic structure due to the terminal -OH (instead of mid-chain), the predicted value for `CCCC(C)(C)CO` would be **slightly lower but still positive**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.55** (approximate, based on trends in the data).

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.8855154927630721
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, **c1ccccc1**) tend to have property values close to zero (e.g., **0.09119022** for benzene). 
   - Fused aromatic systems (e.g., naphthalene-like structures) often have slightly negative values (e.g., **-0.10982664** for **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12**).

2. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Methyl groups (**C**) on aromatic rings tend to increase the property value (e.g., **0.18470412** for **Cc1ccc(C)cc1** vs. **0.09119022** for benzene).
   - Bulky or extended fused systems can reduce the property value (e.g., **-0.7353656** for **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1**, which is a methyl-substituted anthracene/phenanthrene-like structure).

3. **Specific Case for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**:
   - This is a methyl-substituted naphthalene (**methylnaphthalene**). 
   - Comparing to similar structures:
     - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (methyl-substituted naphthalene) has a value of **-0.10982664**.
     - **c1ccccc1** (benzene) has **0.09119022**.
     - The methyl group adds a slight positive contribution, but the fused ring system (naphthalene) tends to reduce the value slightly.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Naphthalene-like structures with methyl groups tend to have values slightly below zero (e.g., **-0.10982664** for **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12**).
- The molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is a methylnaphthalene with a similar structure but slightly less steric bulk (methyl is not on the same ring as the fusion point), the property value should be slightly higher than **-0.10982664** but still negative.

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.05 to -0.10**.  

Given the examples, I predict:  
**-0.08** (specific value chosen based on interpolation between similar structures).  

### Final Answer:  
**-0.08**

Iteration: 12
SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 0.01860411036934726
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic urea derivative with two carbonyl groups. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **-0.8369176**.
   - The core is polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (due to NH and C=O groups), which typically reduces hydrophobicity (logP) or similar properties.

2. **Substituents**:
   - The hydantoin core is substituted with a **branched alkyl group (C(C)CCC)** and a **vinyl group (CC=C)**. 
   - The **C(C)CCC** group adds moderate hydrophobicity, while the **CC=C** (alkene) adds slight polarity but is still relatively hydrophobic.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The closest analog in the examples is **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (property = **-0.8369176**). 
  - The given molecule has an additional **C(C)CCC** substituent, which is more hydrophobic than just a methyl group (C). This would likely increase the property value slightly (less negative).
- Another similar molecule is **CC=C(C(=CC)c1ccc(O)cc1)c2ccc(O)cc2** (property = **-0.27021486**), which has extended conjugation and polar groups, but the given molecule lacks aromaticity and has fewer polar groups.

### Prediction:
Given the hydantoin core (polar, negative contribution) and the hydrophobic substituents (positive contribution), the property value should be slightly less negative than **-0.8369176** but still negative due to the polar core. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.75**  

This balances the polar hydantoin core with the hydrophobic substituents. 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, bioactivity), this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the examples. If the property is logP, the value would reflect moderate hydrophobicity offset by polar groups.

To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Electronegativity Influence**:
   - Molecules with highly electronegative atoms (e.g., halogens like Cl, Br, I) or polar groups (e.g., -OH, -COO-) often have higher property values (less negative or positive). 
     - Example: `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` has a value of **-0.51480511**, while `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` has **0.80609788** (Br and OH increase the value).
   - Fluorine (F) is highly electronegative and may similarly increase the property value.

2. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) with nonpolar substituents (e.g., alkyl groups) tend to have negative values (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` has **-0.85254187**).
   - Polar or electronegative substituents on aromatics (e.g., halogens, -CF3) can raise the value.

3. **Trifluoromethyl Group (-CF3)**:
   - The -CF3 group is strongly electron-withdrawing and polar, similar to halogens. In the given examples, halogenated aromatics often have higher values than non-halogenated ones.
   - Example: `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has **-0.86616937**, but smaller halogenated aromatics like `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (**-0.51480511**) are less negative. The -CF3 group is even more polarizing than Cl.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `Cc1ccccc1CC` (ethylbenzene) has **-0.90538528**, while `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (dichlorobenzene) has **-0.86616937**. Replacing alkyl with halogens raises the value.
   - `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` has a -CF3 group, which is more polar than Cl, so we expect a higher value than dichlorobenzene but not as high as `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (**0.80609788**) because -OH/Br are more strongly polarizing.

### Prediction:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing effect of -CF3 but lack of additional polar groups (like -OH), the property value for `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` should be **higher than dichlorobenzene (-0.866)** but **lower than Br/OH-substituted aromatics (~0.8)**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: -0.45**  

This balances the electronegativity of -CF3 with the aromatic system's baseline negativity.

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.17739748722637952
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, and functional group composition. The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is **sorbitol** (a sugar alcohol with multiple hydroxyl groups). 

From the examples, we observe:
- Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, property = **0.13357994**) tend to have modest positive values.
- The presence of polar groups like hydroxyls increases the property value compared to nonpolar or aromatic systems (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1**, property = **-0.88146129**).
- Sorbitol has even more hydroxyl groups than the example above, which would likely increase its polarity and thus the property value further.

Given this trend, **sorbitol** would be expected to have a **higher positive value** than the similar polyol example (0.13357994). A reasonable prediction would be in the range of **0.2 to 0.4**.

### Predicted property value: **0.25** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trend). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., solubility, partition coefficient, etc.—this is an educated estimate based on the given data.)

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 0.880973502733989
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule in question, I will analyze the key functional groups and structural motifs to predict the property value.

### Molecule to Predict:
**SMILES:** `CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C`

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule contains a polycyclic steroid-like structure (`CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C`), similar to some of the examples (e.g., `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C`, which has a property value of **0.79102735**). Steroid-like structures with polar groups (e.g., carbonyls, hydroxyls) tend to have moderately positive property values.
2. **Carbonyl groups (C=O)**: There are multiple carbonyl groups (`CC(=O)O`, `CC(=O)C3(O)`, `=CC(=O)C=C`). Carbonyls are polar and can contribute to higher property values (e.g., `CC(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O` has a value of **0.72340599**).
3. **Hydroxyl groups (OH)**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (`C3(O)`, `C(O)CC34C`) can increase polarity and interaction potential, similar to the example `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (value **0.13357994**), though the steroid core may dominate.
4. **Ester linkage (`CC(=O)OCC(=O)`)**: This is a polar functional group, similar to `CCOC(=O)C` (value **0.44478121**), but its effect may be moderated by the larger hydrophobic core.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The closest structural analogs are the steroid-like molecules with carbonyls and hydroxyls, which have property values in the range **0.3 to 0.9**.
- The presence of multiple polar groups (carbonyls, hydroxyls, ester) suggests a higher value than simpler steroids but not as high as highly conjugated or aromatic systems (e.g., `c1ccc2cnccc2c1` with **0.82112488**).

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the above, the predicted property value for this molecule is likely in the **upper-middle range** of the examples, around **0.65 to 0.75**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.712**
==================================================
Iteration: 16
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 0.9095654051235317
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, aromaticity, functional groups, and molecular size/complexity. The molecule in question is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, hydroxyl groups, and a ketone group. 

Breaking it down:
1. **Hydroxyl group (-OH)**: Present in the molecule, which can contribute to polarity. In the examples, hydroxyl groups often appear with negative or modest positive values (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` has -0.565, `Oc1cccc2ncccc12` has 0.417).
2. **Ketone group (C=O)**: Present in the molecule. Ketones can contribute to polarity and hydrogen bonding. Examples with ketones vary, but cyclic ketones (e.g., `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)`) have high positive values (0.917).
3. **Polycyclic structure**: The molecule is highly polycyclic (steroid-like), which adds complexity. Polycyclic aromatic structures in the examples (e.g., `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13`) have high positive values (0.912), while saturated polycyclic structures (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O`) have negative values (-0.372).
4. **Saturation**: The molecule is fully saturated (no aromatic rings), which tends to reduce the property value compared to aromatic systems.

Given these observations:
- The hydroxyl and ketone groups suggest some polarity, but the saturated polycyclic nature may offset this.
- The closest analog in the examples is `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (property = -0.372), which is also a saturated polycyclic molecule with hydroxyl groups.

However, the presence of the ketone group (absent in the closest example) might slightly increase the property value. Balancing these factors, the predicted property value is likely modestly negative, similar to other saturated polycyclic molecules with polar groups.

**Predicted property value: -0.45** (approximate, based on structural similarity to the examples).

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.3716114754391236
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH3-CO-NH-)**: Present in the molecule (CC(=O)N-).
   - **Nitro group (NO2)**: Attached to the benzene ring (N(=O)=O).
   - **Aromatic ring**: Substituted with both acetamide and nitro groups.

2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (property: 0.646): Contains an aldehyde and methoxy group on benzene.
   - **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (property: 0.809): Methoxy and nitro groups on benzene.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1** (property: -0.850): Nitrobenzene (no other substituents).
   - **CC(=O)NCc1ccccc1** (not explicitly listed, but similar to acetamide derivatives).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The nitro group tends to lower the property value when alone (e.g., nitrobenzene: -0.850).
   - Adding electron-donating or polar groups (e.g., methoxy, acetamide) increases the property value (e.g., COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O: 0.809).
   - The acetamide group (CC(=O)N-) is moderately polar and electron-withdrawing but less so than nitro.

4. **Prediction**:
   - The molecule has both an acetamide and a nitro group on the benzene ring. The nitro group's strong electron-withdrawing effect is partially offset by the acetamide's polarity.
   - Compared to **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (0.809), replacing the methoxy (electron-donating) with acetamide (less donating) would likely reduce the property value slightly.
   - However, it should still be higher than nitrobenzene (-0.850) due to the additional polar group.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable prediction is:  
**0.45** (between the methoxy-nitrobenzene's 0.809 and nitrobenzene's -0.850, closer to the former due to the acetamide's polarity).

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at other acetamide-like structures (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1**: -0.312), the acetamide group tends to contribute positively but not as strongly as methoxy. Thus, adjusting downward from 0.809:  
**Final Prediction: 0.50** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the examples).  

However, observing **CC(=O)NCc1ccccc1** (not in examples but analogous), the value might be closer to **0.40-0.60**. Given the nitro group's dominance, I'll lean toward:  
**Predicted Property: 0.48**  

But reviewing the examples again, **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (aldehyde + methoxy: 0.646) suggests that acetamide + nitro might be slightly lower, so:  
**Final Answer: 0.42**  

After careful consideration, the most balanced estimate is:  
**Predicted Property Value: 0.45**  

(Note: Without a clear trend or model, this is an approximate interpolation based on similar structures.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 0.22967144575647575
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as aromaticity, functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl, halogens), and structural complexity. The molecule in question is:

**CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**

Breaking it down:
1. It contains a **phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**, which is polar and may contribute negatively to the property (similar to sulfides or thiols in the examples, which often have negative values).
2. It has an **aromatic system with a chlorine substituent (Cl)**, which can have variable effects but often leans toward negative or neutral values unless paired with other strongly positive features.
3. The **thioether linkage (S)** and **ester-like (c(=O)oc)** groups may further reduce the property value (similar to other S-containing or carbonyl-containing molecules in the examples).
4. The molecule is **moderately complex**, but not as much as some of the highly negative examples (e.g., steroids or polyhalogenated aromatics).

Comparing to similar molecules in the dataset:
- **Cl-substituted aromatics** (e.g., `Clc1cccc2ccccc12` = -0.932, `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` = +0.317) show variability, but the presence of P=O/S and S linkages here likely pushes the value downward.
- **S-containing molecules** (e.g., `CSSC` = -0.904, `CCCCNC(=O)n1c(NC(=O)OC)nc2ccccc12` = -0.851) tend to have negative values.
- **Aromatic esters/carbonyls** (e.g., `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` = -0.701) also trend negative.

Given these observations, the predicted property value is likely in the **moderately negative range**, similar to other S- or Cl-containing aromatic systems. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.72**  
*(This aligns with the trends for polar, S/Cl-containing aromatic compounds in the dataset.)*

SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.5356557811645307
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - **CCCCCCC(C)O**: -0.90326396 (branched chain with OH)
   - **CC(C)CO**: 0.52658147 (less branched, smaller)
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**: 0.13357994 (polyol)
   - **CCCC(O)CCC**: 0.10596231 (linear alcohol)
   - **CCCCCCCC(C)O**: 0.64649009 (longer chain, branched)
   - **CCCCO**: Not explicitly given, but similar to **CC(C)CO** (0.52658147).

   Branched alcohols with longer chains tend to have higher positive values, while highly branched or smaller alcohols may have lower or negative values.

2. **Branched vs. Linear**:
   - **CCC**: 0.49131435 (linear)
   - **CC(C)CO**: 0.52658147 (branched but small)
   - **CCCC(=C)C**: -0.93025717 (branched with double bond)
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O**: -0.93072175 (aromatic with branched OH)

   Branching alone doesn't always lower the value, but combined with other features (e.g., unsaturation, aromaticity), it can lead to negative values.

3. **CC(C)(C)CO**:
   - This is a tertiary alcohol (more branched than **CC(C)CO** but similar to **CCCCCCC(C)O**).
   - The tert-butanol structure (**CC(C)(C)CO**) is more sterically hindered than **CC(C)CO**, which might lower the property value compared to less branched alcohols.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **CC(C)CO**: 0.52658147 (less branched)
- **CCCCCCC(C)O**: -0.90326396 (longer chain, branched)
- **CCCCO**: Not given, but likely similar to **CC(C)CO** (0.5-0.6 range).

Given that **CC(C)(C)CO** is more branched than **CC(C)CO** but less extreme than **CCCCCCC(C)O**, its value is likely between these two. Since branching tends to reduce the property value (but not always drastically), a reasonable estimate is slightly lower than **CC(C)CO** but not as negative as **CCCCCCC(C)O**.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.35** (slightly lower than **CC(C)CO** due to increased branching, but still positive). 

However, looking at **CCCCCCCC(C)O** (0.64649009), which is branched but long-chain, and **CC(C)CO** (0.52658147), the value for **CC(C)(C)CO** might be slightly lower but still positive. 

Given the examples, a more precise estimate is:  
**0.45** (closer to **CC(C)CO** but accounting for the additional branching). 

But reviewing the trend again, highly branched alcohols like **CCCCCCC(C)O** have negative values, so **CC(C)(C)CO** might also trend toward the negative side, but not as extreme. 

Given the ambiguity, a conservative estimate is:  
**0.20** (between the positive and negative trends for branched alcohols). 

However, **CC(C)CO** is 0.526, and **CC(C)(C)CO** is more branched, so likely lower but still positive. 

Final prediction: **0.40**. 

But to be precise, let's average **CC(C)CO** (0.526) and **CCCCCCC(C)O** (-0.903), weighting toward the less extreme branch:  
(0.526 * 0.7 + (-0.903) * 0.3) ≈ 0.15. 

Given the inconsistency, the safest bet is:  
**0.30** (slightly positive but reduced by branching). 

### Final Answer:
**0.30** (approximate, based on branching and alcohol trends). 

However, looking back, **CC(C)CO** is 0.526, and **CC(C)(C)CO** is more branched, so likely slightly lower but still positive. Thus, a better estimate is **0.40**. 

Given the examples, the most reasonable prediction is:  
**0.35**. 

But to match the precision of the given data, we'll round to:  
**0.36**. 

After careful consideration, the predicted property value for **CC(C)(C)CO** is:  
**0.36**.

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -0.1106775286901009
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, I will analyze the molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** and predict its property value based on structural similarities and trends observed in the dataset.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains:
   - Two **amide-like nitrogens** (`[nH]`), which are hydrogen-bond donors.
   - A **carbonyl group (C=O)**, which is a hydrogen-bond acceptor.
   - A **fused bicyclic aromatic system** with multiple nitrogens (similar to purine-like structures).

2. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (property = -0.64580073): This is a pyrimidone derivative with a fluorine substituent. The presence of the C=O and NH groups is similar, but the fluorine adds electronegativity, likely lowering the property.
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property = 0.51022159): This is a methoxy-substituted purine-like structure. The aromatic nitrogens and fused ring system are similar, but the methoxy group increases the property.
   - **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1** (property = -0.29579151): This is a uracil-like structure with an NH₂ group. The C=O and NH groups are similar, but the additional NH₂ group may lower the property.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Molecules with **hydrogen-bond donors (NH)** and **acceptors (C=O)** tend to have moderate property values (between -0.6 and 0.5).
   - Fused aromatic systems with nitrogens (e.g., purine-like) often have higher property values (e.g., 0.51022159 for COc2ncc1nccnc1n2).
   - The absence of strongly electronegative substituents (like F or Cl) and the presence of multiple NH groups suggest a property value in the **positive but moderate range**.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarities to **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property = 0.51022159) but without the methoxy group (which likely increases the property), and considering the NH groups (which may slightly lower it), the predicted property for **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** is:

**0.45** (approximate, likely between 0.4 and 0.5). 

This aligns with the trend for fused nitrogen-containing heterocycles with hydrogen-bonding groups but no strongly electronegative substituents.

Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.5803343449974643
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** `CC(C)OC=O`  
This is **isopropyl formate**, which has the structure:  
- An ester group (`-OC=O`), which is polar and can contribute to a moderate property value.  
- A branched alkyl group (`CC(C)`), which reduces polarity compared to linear chains.  

Looking at similar molecules in the examples:  
- `CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` has a value of **-0.40278902** (complex ester with bulky nonpolar groups).  
- `CCOC=C` has a value of **0.91647103** (simple ether/alkene, less polar than an ester).  
- `COc1ccc(C=O)cc1` has a value of **0.6463275** (ester + aromatic, moderately polar).  

Since `CC(C)OC=O` is a simple ester with a small branched alkyl group, it is likely **less polar** than aromatic esters but **more polar** than bulky aliphatic esters.  

**Predicted property value:** **0.35** (moderate polarity, similar to other small esters/aliphatic polar molecules in the dataset).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated estimate based on trends in the given data.)*

SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: -0.06446377355511038
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **urea core (O=C(NR)NR')**, where both R and R' are phenyl groups (aromatic rings). 
   - Urea derivatives often exhibit polarity due to the carbonyl (C=O) and NH groups, but the aromatic rings can introduce hydrophobicity.

2. **Aromaticity**: 
   - Two phenyl rings are attached to the urea moiety, contributing significant hydrophobicity and potential for π-π stacking.

3. **Polarity vs. Hydrophobicity**: 
   - The urea group is polar, but the two large aromatic rings dominate the molecule's properties, likely making it less polar overall.

### Comparison with Given Examples:
- **Similar Molecules**:
  - **N-phenyl amides (e.g., CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, property = -0.8237735)**: These are polar due to the amide but have aromatic rings. The urea here is more polar than a simple amide, but the two aromatic rings counteract this.
  - **Aromatic systems with polar groups (e.g., Oc1ccccc1Cl, property = -0.56512412)**: These tend to have negative property values due to mixed polarity/hydrophobicity.
  - **Highly aromatic systems (e.g., c1ccncc1, property = 0.61587308)**: Pure aromatic systems often have positive values, but polar groups reduce this.

- **Urea-Specific Examples**:
  - The molecule is a **diaryl urea**, which is more hydrophobic than polar due to the two aromatic rings. Similar structures in the dataset (e.g., with polar + aromatic features) tend to have negative or near-zero values.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the polar urea group and the two hydrophobic phenyl rings, the property value is likely **moderately negative**. Comparing to similar molecules:
- The urea group is more polar than a simple amide, but the two aromatic rings push the property toward less polar (but not as extreme as pure hydrocarbons).
- A reasonable estimate is between **-0.5 and -0.7**.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.62** (This is a weighted guess based on the examples, leaning toward the more negative side due to the urea's polarity being offset by the two aromatic rings.)

Iteration: 23
SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 0.91228467355768
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property seems to correlate with molecular features such as aromaticity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, which is **fluorene**, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with three fused benzene rings.

From the examples:
- Aromatic systems with extended conjugation (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1`, property = 0.86083502) tend to have higher property values.
- Smaller aromatic systems (e.g., `Sc1ccccc1`, property = -0.67119737) tend to have lower or negative values.
- Fluorene has a similar structure to the high-value aromatic examples but is slightly less conjugated than the larger PAHs.

Given this, the predicted property for fluorene (**C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**) would likely be **between 0.6 and 0.8**. A reasonable estimate based on the examples is:

**Predicted property value: 0.75**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. The actual value could vary slightly depending on the specific property being measured.)

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -0.4296927750289443
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O))**, which is highly polar and often associated with negative property values (e.g., in drugs, sulfonamides can increase hydrophilicity).
   - It also has **two primary amine groups (NH2)** and a **guanidine-like moiety (NC(=N)N)**, which are polar and can form hydrogen bonds.

2. **Aromatic Ring**:
   - The presence of a benzene ring with an amine substituent (**c1ccc(N)cc1**) adds some hydrophobicity but is counterbalanced by the polar amine.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with sulfonamide or highly polar groups (e.g., **ClC(=C(Cl)C(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl**, **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**) tend to have negative property values (around -0.4 to -0.9).
   - Molecules with aromatic rings and polar substituents (e.g., **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**) can have positive values if the polar effects are offset by other features, but here the sulfonamide dominates.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12** (property = 0.851) has polar amide groups but is less polar overall due to the lack of sulfonamide.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property = -0.920) is highly halogenated and nonpolar, but sulfonamides are more polar than halogens.

### Prediction:
Given the strong polar character of the sulfonamide and amine groups, the molecule is likely to have a **negative property value**. Based on the examples, a reasonable estimate would be between **-0.5 and -0.7**. 

A precise prediction based on the trend is:  
**Predicted property value = -0.65**  

This aligns with the observed trend where highly polar/ionic groups (e.g., sulfonamides, multiple amines) correlate with negative values in the given dataset.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.3133329516483917
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size. The molecule in question is:

**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**

### Key structural features:
1. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**: These are strongly electron-withdrawing and polar, which in the examples tend to decrease the property value (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a value of `-0.51477298`).
2. **Trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)**: Highly electronegative and lipophilic, often associated with negative property values (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` has `-0.90474749`).
3. **Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C)**: Aliphatic amines can increase the property value, but here it is offset by the nitro and CF3 groups.
4. **Aromatic ring with multiple substitutions**: The presence of two nitro groups and a CF3 group on the aromatic ring suggests strong electron withdrawal, likely reducing the property value.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- Molecules with multiple nitro groups (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O`) have strongly negative values (`-0.90474749`).
- The CF3 group further enhances electron withdrawal, similar to highly halogenated molecules (e.g., `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl` with `-0.80540177`).

### Prediction:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing effects of the nitro and CF3 groups, the property value is expected to be **highly negative**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.92**  

This aligns with the trend observed for heavily substituted, polar, and electron-deficient aromatic systems in the examples.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.5803343449974643
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the given examples:
1. **Functional groups and polarity**:
   - Molecules with **alcohol groups (-OH)** tend to have negative property values (e.g., CCCCCO, -0.79295173; OC1CCCCCC1, -0.22568263).
   - Molecules with **carbonyl groups (C=O)** in esters or aldehydes often have positive or near-zero values (e.g., CCCC=O, 0.61204724; O=C1CCCCC1, 0.50529882; CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, -0.80288149).
   - **Ethers (R-O-R')** seem to have mixed effects, but when combined with carbonyls, they may lean slightly positive (e.g., COC(=O)c1cccnc1, 0.20576601; CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC, -0.22637388).

2. **Branching and size**:
   - Branched molecules (e.g., CC(C)(C)C(=O)C(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)n2cncn2, -0.23241936) often have lower (more negative) values than linear ones.
   - Small molecules with polar groups (e.g., ClC(Cl)Cl, 0.22904667) can have positive values, while larger alkanes (e.g., C1CCCCCCC1, -0.83703872) are negative.

3. **Specific case for CC(C)OC=O**:
   - This is an **ester (isopropyl formate)** with a branched alkyl group (isopropyl) and a formyl (C=O) group.
   - Similar examples:
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl ester with aniline): -0.80288149 (negative due to the aromatic amine).
     - **COC(=O)c1cccnc1** (methyl ester with pyridine): 0.20576601 (slightly positive).
     - **CCCCCOC(=O)C** (hexyl ester): 0.41987157 (positive).
   - The branching (isopropyl) might slightly reduce the value compared to linear esters, but the C=O group adds polarity.

### Prediction:
Given the ester functionality and the branched structure, the property value is likely **slightly positive but lower than linear esters**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.15**  

This is based on:
- Esters with small/branched groups (like isopropyl) having values between 0.1 and 0.3.
- No strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups to push it significantly higher or lower. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data.)

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 0.6395164808854515
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Oxygen (O)**:
   - Molecules with hydroxyl groups (-OH) or ether linkages (e.g., COC) often have property values in the range of **0.4 to 0.8** (e.g., COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1: 0.460, OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO: 0.133, Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3: 0.834).
   - However, if the oxygen is part of a carbonyl (C=O) group, the property tends to be negative (e.g., O=Cc1ccccc1: -0.921).

2. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., c1ccccc1) or substituted aromatics often have property values around **0.4 to 0.9** (e.g., c1ccc2ccccc2c1: 0.417, c1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ccccc3: 0.916).
   - Substitution with electron-donating groups (e.g., -OH, -OCH3) tends to increase the property value, while electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -NO2, -Cl) decrease it.

3. **Alkyl Groups**:
   - Molecules with simple alkyl groups (e.g., CC(C)C: 0.865, CCC(C)CCO: 0.524) tend to have positive property values, especially if they are branched or hydrophobic.

4. **Halogens (Cl, Br, I)**:
   - Halogen substitution generally lowers the property value, especially with multiple halogens (e.g., Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl: -0.866).

### Analysis of **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**:
- The molecule is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (cresol derivative) with:
  - Aromatic ring with two methyl groups (electron-donating) and one hydroxyl group (-OH, electron-donating).
  - No halogens or other electron-withdrawing groups.
  - Similar to examples like COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1 (0.460) or c1ccccc1O (-0.416), but with methyl groups instead of additional hydroxyls or carbonyls.

Given the presence of **two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group**, the electron-donating effects are significant, likely pushing the property value into the **positive range**. Comparing to similar structures:
- COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1 (0.460) has more hydroxyls but also a carbonyl (which reduces the value).
- c1ccccc1O (-0.416) has only one hydroxyl and no alkyl groups, so the value is negative.
- CCc1ccccc1C (0.474) has two alkyl groups and no hydroxyl, giving a positive value.

Thus, **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** should have a **positive property value**, likely between **0.4 and 0.6**, balancing the effects of the hydroxyl and methyl groups.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.52** (approximate, based on similar examples). 

This is a reasonable estimate given the structural features and trends observed in the training data.

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: -0.9309586275249716
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: 
   - Molecules with this group (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl`) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.317, -0.931). 
   - However, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a positive value (0.905), suggesting that halogen substitution (Cl) can flip the sign.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, Br, I) often increase the property value (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` = 0.897).
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) tend to decrease or have mixed effects (e.g., `Cc1ccc(O)c(C)c1` = 0.655).

3. **Thioether (SC) Group**:
   - The presence of sulfur (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O` = 0.585) can increase the property value, especially when bonded to an aromatic ring.

4. **Hybridization**:
   - The molecule has a phosphorothioate group (P=S), aromatic ring with thioether (SC), and methyl (C) substituents. The thioether is likely to contribute positively, while the phosphorothioate may have a context-dependent effect.

### Prediction:
The molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** has:
- A phosphorothioate group (historically mixed effects, but often negative unless balanced by other features).
- A thioether (SC) on the aromatic ring (likely positive contribution).
- Methyl (C) and methoxy (OC) groups (electron-donating, may reduce the value slightly).

Given the strong positive influence of the thioether and the mixed but potentially offsetting effects of the phosphorothioate, the property value is likely **moderately positive**. 

Comparing to similar structures:
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (0.905) has halogens (strongly positive).
- `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O` (0.585) has a sulfur group.

The lack of halogens here but presence of thioether suggests a value **between 0.5 and 0.9**. A reasonable estimate is **~0.75**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.75** (specific estimate: 0.753).

Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.07077894051172481
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property seems to correlate with molecular features such as halogenation (especially chlorine substitution), aromaticity, and molecular complexity. 

The molecule in question is highly chlorinated and aromatic:  
**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**  

This structure resembles some of the highly chlorinated examples in the dataset, such as:  
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** → **-0.86616937**  
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** → **0.69995341**  

The key differences are:  
1. The new molecule has **more chlorines** (6 Cl atoms vs. 7 in the second example).  
2. The **connectivity is slightly different** (a fused biphenyl-like structure with chlorines).  

Given that:  
- Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds in the dataset span both **positive and negative values**, but the **more symmetric and fully substituted** ones tend to have **higher (positive) values**.  
- The molecule is **less symmetric** than **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (0.69995341)** but **more chlorinated** than **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (-0.86616937)**.  

### Predicted Property:  
A reasonable estimate would be **between -0.2 and 0.5**, leaning toward a **moderate positive value** due to the high chlorine count but less symmetry than the highest-scoring example.  

**Final Prediction: ~0.45**  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical guess based on trends in the data.)*

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.4965886645823025
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** (1-nitropropane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups tend to have lower (often negative) property values, especially when the nitro group is attached to an aromatic ring or a polar environment. For example:
     - `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (dicyanobenzene): **0.00387929** (neutral, no nitro)
     - `Nc1ccccc1O` (aminophenol): **-0.90400595** (no nitro, but highly negative due to polar groups)
     - `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (trinitrobenzene): **0.069531** (unexpectedly neutral, possibly due to symmetry)
     - `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` (nitro and trifluoromethyl groups): **-0.91735322** (very negative).

2. **Aliphatic Nitro Compounds**:
   - The molecule `CCCN(=O)=O` is an aliphatic nitro compound (1-nitropropane). Aliphatic nitro compounds are less polar than aromatic nitro compounds but still have significant polarity due to the nitro group.
   - Compare with `CCCCCC=O` (hexanal): **0.2959952** (moderately positive, due to carbonyl).
   - Compare with `CCC` (propane): **0.49131435** (neutral hydrocarbon, no polar groups).

3. **Hybridization and Chain Length**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains with polar groups tend to have reduced property values (e.g., `CCCCCCC(=O)C`: **-0.80429156**).
   - Short chains with polar groups (like `CCCN(=O)=O`) may have intermediate values.

4. **Nitro Group Impact**:
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which likely reduces the property value compared to non-polar alkanes.
   - However, in aliphatic systems, the effect is less pronounced than in aromatic systems (where resonance enhances polarity).

### Prediction:
Given the above, **CCCN(=O)=O** is expected to have a property value lower than neutral alkanes (e.g., `CCC`: **0.49131435**) but higher than highly polar or aromatic nitro compounds (e.g., **-0.91735322**). 

A reasonable estimate is **slightly negative or near zero**, similar to `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (**0.069531**) but adjusted for the aliphatic nature. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O: ~0.10** (slightly positive due to aliphatic nature, but nitro group pulls it toward neutral). 

However, reviewing the examples again, aliphatic nitro compounds are underrepresented, and the closest analogies suggest a value closer to **0.0 to 0.2**. 

Given the uncertainty, I will predict:  
**0.15** (moderately low positive value, balancing aliphatic and nitro effects). 

But to match the trend more precisely, a better estimate might be:  
**0.05** (very close to neutral, as nitro and alkyl effects partially cancel). 

After reconsidering, the most consistent prediction is:  
**0.07** (similar to trinitrobenzene's neutrality but adjusted for aliphatic context). 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O: 0.07**

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.7334983891841995
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations:
1. **Halogen Substitution (Cl, Br, F)**:
   - Molecules with halogen substitutions (especially Cl and Br) on aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, often in the range of **0.5 to 0.8**.
     - Example: `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` → **0.53168951**
     - Example: `COc1cccc(Cl)c1` → **0.75252182**
     - Example: `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` → **0.76924454**
   - Fluorine (F) substitutions also seem to contribute positively but may have slightly lower values than Cl/Br:
     - Example: `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1` → **0.87833344** (though this also has an amide group).

2. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic systems with halogens (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have moderate to high positive values unless other functional groups dominate.

3. **Combination of Halogens**:
   - When multiple halogens are present (e.g., Cl and Br), the property value tends to be additive or averaged. For example, `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` has both Cl and Br and a value of **0.53168951**.

4. **Fluorine vs. Chlorine/Bromine**:
   - Fluorine is less electronegative than Cl/Br but still contributes to polarity. In `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`, we have both F and Br, which likely leads to a value similar to or slightly higher than `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` (0.53168951).

### Prediction for Fc1cccc(Br)c1:
- This is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substitution (para to fluorine). 
- Given that `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` (chlorobenzene with bromine) has a value of **0.53168951**, and fluorine is slightly less electron-withdrawing than chlorine, we might expect a similar or slightly lower value.
- However, the presence of both F and Br could lead to a slightly higher value due to additive effects (e.g., `COc1cccc(Cl)c1` with Cl and OMe is **0.75252182**).

Given these trends, a reasonable prediction for `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` is:
**~0.55 to 0.65**

### Final Predicted Value:
**0.60** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 0.912100060914353
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -Br, -Cl) tend to have higher property values (e.g., CBr: 0.229, CCCCBr: 0.898, NC(=O)CCl: 0.918).
   - Nonpolar or less polar molecules (e.g., hydrocarbons like CCCc1ccc(CC)cc1: -0.911) tend to have lower or negative property values.
   - The presence of multiple halogens or electronegative atoms often increases the property value (e.g., Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl: -0.092 vs. Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl: -0.092).

2. **Ring Systems and Complexity**:
   - Molecules with complex ring systems or fused rings (e.g., steroids like CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO: -0.717) often have intermediate to negative values, possibly due to steric effects or reduced polarity.
   - Simpler cyclic structures with polar groups (e.g., CC1CCCO1: -0.832) can have lower values if the polarity is not dominant.

3. **Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - Molecules with hydrogen bond donors/acceptors (e.g., -OH, -NH) often have higher property values (e.g., NC(=O)CCl: 0.918, Nc1nc[nH]n1: 0.749).

4. **Steric Hindrance**:
   - Bulky groups (e.g., tert-butyl) can reduce the property value (e.g., CC(C)(C)CO: -0.536).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**
- **Structure**: This is a bicyclic molecule with two fused rings (a cyclohexane and a cyclopentane). It has a tertiary alcohol (-OH) and two quaternary carbons (with -CH3 groups).
- **Polarity**: The -OH group introduces some polarity, but the bulky nonpolar -CH3 groups and the fused ring system may reduce the overall polarity.
- **Comparison with Examples**:
  - Similar to steroid-like structures (e.g., CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO: -0.717), but simpler.
  - The presence of -OH is similar to CC(C)(C)CO (-0.536), but the fused rings add complexity.
  - Less polar than NC(=O)CCl (0.918) but more polar than pure hydrocarbons.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance between the polar -OH group and the nonpolar bulky structure, the property value is likely **intermediate-negative**. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.45** (closer to the steroid-like examples but slightly higher due to the -OH group). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.45** (estimated based on structural similarity and trends in the given data).

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.7684760439043733
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and overall molecular complexity. The molecule in question is:

**CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**

Let's break it down:
1. It contains a **phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**, which is polar and often contributes to higher property values (as seen in similar structures like **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O**, which has a value of **0.00606422**).
2. It has an **aromatic ring (c1ccccc1)** and **amide groups (C(=O)N)**, which are common in the dataset and can influence the property value.
3. The molecule is **less halogenated** compared to some of the highly negative examples (e.g., Cl-heavy molecules tend to have lower values).
4. The presence of **ethoxy groups (OCC)** adds some polarity but not as much as strongly electron-withdrawing groups like nitro or carbonyls.

Comparing to similar structures:
- The closest example is **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** with a value of **0.00606422**. Our molecule lacks the **SC(CCl)** moiety, which likely reduces its polarity slightly.
- Other aromatic amides (e.g., **CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3ccccc23**) have positive values (~0.108), suggesting this class tends toward modestly positive values.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is likely in the **low positive range**, similar to its closest analog but slightly higher due to reduced bulkiness. 

**Predicted value: ~0.10** (approximating between 0.006 and 0.108). 

For precision, I would estimate **0.08** as a balanced prediction.

Iteration: 34
SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 0.7878552719588536
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like** or **quinoxaline-like** core with a **carbonyl group (C=O)** and **two nitrogen atoms** in a fused ring system. This is somewhat similar to the following example:
   - **O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23** (property = **-0.8301745**), which also has a fused ring with N and C=O.

2. **Substituents**: 
   - Two **methyl groups (C)** attached to the nitrogens.
   - A **phenyl ring (c2ccccc2)** fused to the core. This is similar to aromatic systems in other examples, such as **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32** (property = **0.50769939**), but with additional electronegative atoms.

3. **Electronegativity and Polarity**: 
   - The **C=O group** introduces polarity, which often reduces the property value (more negative) in the given examples (e.g., **CCCCOC** = -0.93202611, where an ether oxygen reduces the value).
   - The **nitrogens** and **aromatic system** may partially offset this, as seen in **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32** (property = 0.50769939).

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23** (property = -0.8301745) is structurally closest, with a fused aromatic system, C=O, and N. The presence of **two methyl groups** in **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** may slightly increase the property (less negative) due to added hydrophobicity.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the **polar C=O/N** (reducing the value) and the **aromatic/methyl groups** (increasing the value), the property is likely **moderately negative but less so than the closest example (-0.8301745)**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property = -0.65**  

This aligns with the trend where fused aromatic + polar groups yield intermediate values, and methyl groups push it slightly higher.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.888425674387955
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with highly polar groups (e.g., multiple hydroxyls, amines, or carbonyls) tend to have higher (more positive) property values. 
     - Example: **OCC(O)C(O)CO** (glycerol) has a value of **-0.85179699**, but this is likely due to its high polarity overwhelming other factors.
     - **COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1** (a gallate ester) has a value of **0.46079445** due to aromaticity and polar groups.
   - Nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCCC**) have very negative values (**-0.93025717**).
   - Esters (e.g., **CCOC(=O)N**) have positive values (**0.90429306**), suggesting that ester groups contribute positively to the property.

2. **Aromaticity**:
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens) tend to have negative values (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1I** with **-0.53411762**).
   - Aromatic rings with electron-donating groups or fused systems (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)cnc3ccccc23**) have high positive values (**0.90619234**).

3. **Molecular Size and Branching**:
   - Larger, more complex molecules (e.g., steroids or sugars) often have intermediate to high positive values due to structural rigidity and functional groups.
   - Simple linear hydrocarbons have very negative values.

4. **Halogens**:
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, I) tend to decrease the property value unless balanced by other polar groups.

### Analysis of **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is **ethyl hexanoate**, an ester with a 6-carbon aliphatic chain and an ethoxy group.
- Esters generally have positive contributions (e.g., **CCOC(=O)N** at **0.90429306** and **COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1** at **0.46079445**).
- The aliphatic chain (**CCCCCC**) is nonpolar and would contribute negatively, but the ester group dominates.
- The molecule is not aromatic and has no halogens or other strongly polar groups besides the ester.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **CCOC(=O)N** (ethyl carbamate): **0.90429306** (very high due to the ester and polar N).
- **COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1**: **0.46079445** (ester + polar aromatic).
- **CCCCC**: **-0.93025717** (pure hydrocarbon).
- **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is intermediate: less polar than **CCOC(=O)N** but more polar than pure hydrocarbons.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the ester group's positive contribution and the aliphatic chain's negative but not overwhelming effect, the predicted value is likely in the **middle range of positive values**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**0.48603702** (similar to **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**, which is a non-aromatic ester with a long aliphatic chain).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCCCCC(=O)OCC: 0.486** (rounded to 3 decimal places).

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.6966901691531823
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Polar Substituents**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC** (a diester with a long aliphatic chain) has a high positive value (**0.91458393**).
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) has a value of **-0.18773604**.
   - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate) is structurally similar to ethyl benzoate but with a shorter alkoxy group (methoxy instead of ethoxy).

2. **Esters vs. Non-Esters**:
   - Esters (e.g., **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**) tend to have moderately negative values unless they are part of larger or more complex structures (e.g., diesters or long-chain esters, which can have positive values).
   - The presence of an aromatic ring with an ester group (**COC(=O)c1ccccc1**) is likely to result in a value similar to ethyl benzoate but slightly more negative due to the shorter methoxy group (less hydrophobic contribution).

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**: **-0.18773604** (ethyl benzoate)
   - **COC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1**: **-0.64560535** (methyl salicylate, additional OH group makes it more negative)
   - **COC(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)Nc2cccc(C)c2)c1**: **-0.26873856** (more complex, but still negative)

   Methyl benzoate (**COC(=O)c1ccccc1**) is simpler than methyl salicylate and lacks the additional OH group, so its value should be less negative than **-0.64560535** but likely more negative than ethyl benzoate (**-0.18773604**) due to the shorter methoxy group.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, I predict the property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** to be slightly more negative than ethyl benzoate but not as negative as methyl salicylate. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: -0.25** (approximate, likely between -0.2 and -0.3). 

For specificity, I'll refine this to **-0.23** based on interpolation between the given examples. 

### Final Answer:
**-0.23** (estimated based on structural similarity and trends in the data).
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.9147282583527475
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the analysis:

1. **Simple alkenes (C=C bonds)**:
   - `C/C=C/C` (butene) has a value of -0.01000519.
   - `C=Cc1ccccc1` (styrene-like) has a value of -0.59656973.

2. **Conjugated systems**:
   - The molecule `C=CCC=C` (1,3-butadiene) is a conjugated diene, which often exhibits slightly different properties due to delocalization of π-electrons.

3. **Trends**:
   - Non-conjugated alkenes (like `C/C=C/C`) have values close to zero.
   - Conjugated systems (like `C=Cc1ccccc1`) tend to have more negative values.
   - The presence of conjugation in `C=CCC=C` would likely push the value more negative than `C/C=C/C` but not as extreme as aromatic systems.

4. **Prediction**:
   - The property value for `C=CCC=C` should be slightly more negative than `C/C=C/C` (-0.01000519) but less negative than `C=Cc1ccccc1` (-0.59656973).
   - A reasonable estimate would be around **-0.2 to -0.4**.

Given the examples, the closest analog is `C/C=C/C`, but with conjugation, the value should shift more negative. A plausible prediction is:

**Predicted property value for `C=CCC=C`: -0.25** (interpolated based on the trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an empirical estimate based on the given data.)

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.42796621341194374
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobenzene derivative): Property = **0.69995341**
   - **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (chlorinated biphenyl): Property = **-0.93162379**
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (brominated biphenyl): Property = **0.1205577**
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (halogenated alkane): Property = **-0.48031055**
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (polychlorinated biphenyl): Property = **0.07077894**

   Halogenated compounds show a wide range of property values, but heavily halogenated aliphatic compounds (like **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br**) tend to have negative values, while aromatic halogenated compounds can be positive or negative.

2. **Brominated Aliphatic Compounds**:
   - The only fully brominated aliphatic example is **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), which is not explicitly in the training set, but we can compare it to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (property = **-0.48031055**), which is a similarly heavily halogenated small alkane.

3. **Molecular Size and Polarity**:
   - Small, highly halogenated aliphatic molecules (e.g., **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br**) tend to have negative property values, likely due to their high electronegativity and lack of aromaticity or conjugation.
   - **BrC(Br)Br** is a small, symmetric molecule with no aromaticity or polar functional groups other than the halogens.

### Prediction:
Given that **BrC(Br)Br** is a small, fully brominated aliphatic compound, similar to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (property = **-0.48031055**), but with even more bromine atoms (which are larger and less electronegative than fluorine), I would expect its property value to be slightly more negative than **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** but not as extreme as some of the large aromatic halogenated compounds.

### Estimated Property Value:
A reasonable prediction for **BrC(Br)Br** is **-0.55**. This balances the trends observed in similar halogenated aliphatic compounds.

**Final Answer: -0.55**

Iteration: 39
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.006064222456093013
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key structural observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P=S)**: Present in the molecule (similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**, which has a property value of **0.41039509**). This group often contributes positively to the property value.
2. **Aromatic rings (c1ccccc1)**: Present (similar to many examples, e.g., **c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2** with **0.91468263**). Aromaticity tends to increase the property value.
3. **Chlorine substituent (CCl)**: Present (similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** with **-0.92094398**, but here it's less dominant due to other features).
4. **Lactam (N2C(=O)...C2=O)**: A cyclic amide (similar to **CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O** with **-0.67214161**). Lactams can reduce the property value.
5. **Ethoxy groups (CCOP and OCC)**: Present (similar to **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** with **0.80890589**). Alkoxy groups often increase the property value.

### Balancing contributions:
- The **P=S** and **aromatic rings** suggest a positive contribution (~0.4 to 0.6).
- The **chlorine** and **lactam** suggest a negative contribution (~-0.6 to -0.7).
- The **ethoxy groups** may slightly offset the negative effects.

### Predicted property value:
Given the competing effects, the property value is likely **moderately positive but lower than the purely aromatic or P=S-dominated examples**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.25**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the provided data. For precise predictions, computational or experimental methods would be needed.)

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.4074341494987211
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Amide (N-C=O)**: Present in the form of **CN(C)C(=O)N-**. From the examples, amides like **CN(C)C(=O)C** (0.69084315) and **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (-0.91808033) show that the property can vary significantly depending on substitution. Here, the amide is part of a larger conjugated system, which may lower the value.
   - **Aromatic Chlorine (Cl)**: The presence of **c(Cl)c1** suggests electron-withdrawing effects. Examples like **Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (0.69640948) and **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (-0.92094398) show that Cl can contribute to either positive or negative values depending on context. Here, it's likely stabilizing and reducing the property.
   - **Heterocycle (n2nc(oc2=O))**: This is a fused heterocyclic system with an oxo group (=O). Similar fragments like **c1ccc2ccccc2c1** (0.41755484) or **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32** (0.50769939) suggest modest positive contributions, but the oxo group may reduce this.
   - **Bulky tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)**: This is highly hydrophobic and may slightly increase the property, but its steric effects could dominate.

2. **Polarity and Conjugation**:
   - The molecule has significant conjugation (amide + aromatic + heterocycle), which typically lowers the property (as seen in many negative examples).
   - The **Cl** and **oxo group** add polarity, further reducing the property.

3. **Comparison to Similar Examples**:
   - The closest analog is **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (-0.91808033), where the amide is fully substituted. Here, the amide is part of a larger conjugated system, which may reduce the property further.
   - The **Cl** and heterocycle resemble **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (-0.92094398), suggesting a strong negative contribution.

### Synthesis of Observations:
- The amide and conjugation suggest a negative value.
- The Cl and oxo group reinforce this trend.
- The bulky tert-butyl group may slightly offset this, but not enough to make it positive.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above, the molecule likely has a **strongly negative property value**, similar to **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (-0.918) or **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (-0.921). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: -0.85** (with uncertainty around ±0.1 due to competing effects). 

This balances the strongly negative contributions from the amide and Cl with the modest positive effects of the heterocycle and tert-butyl group.

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 0.19208435636649787
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Chlorine (Cl)**: 
   - Molecules with multiple Cl substituents often have higher property values (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` has **0.89785159**, `c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2` has **0.8541338**).
   - However, `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has a negative value (**-0.68589784**), suggesting steric or electronic effects from excessive Cl substitution may lower the property.

2. **Phenol (OH) Groups**: 
   - Phenols with Cl substituents tend to have high positive values (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` at **0.89785159**).
   - The molecule here has two phenol groups (`Oc1...Oc2...`), which may amplify the effect.

3. **Symmetry and Conjugation**: 
   - The molecule is symmetric with two phenol rings linked by an ether bridge (`Oc1...Oc2...`), and each ring has Cl substituents. This extended conjugation and symmetry may increase the property value.

4. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (1 phenol + 2 Cl): **0.89785159**
   - `c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2` (biphenyl with Cl): **0.8541338**
   - The target molecule has **two phenol rings + three Cl atoms**, which likely pushes the value even higher than these examples.

### Prediction:
Given the strong positive contribution from Cl and phenol groups, combined with symmetry and conjugation, the property value should be **higher than 0.89785159** but not excessively so (since excessive Cl can sometimes reduce it). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.92**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend that Cl and OH groups increase the value, and symmetry/conjugation further enhance it.)

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.010005193834576032
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size. 

The molecule in question is `CC/C=C\C`, which is trans-2-pentene (a simple alkene with a trans double bond). 

From the examples:
- `CC/C=C/C` (likely cis-2-butene or similar) has a property value of `-0.01000519`.
- `CCCC(C)C` (a branched alkane) has a value of `-0.0136734`.
- `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` (a long alkane) has a value of `-0.89616813`.

Alkenes like `CC/C=C/C` and `CC/C=C\C` are structurally similar, with the main difference being cis/trans configuration. Since the property values for simple alkenes and alkanes in the examples are close to zero (slightly negative), and trans alkenes are typically less polar than cis alkenes (due to symmetry), we can infer that the property value for `CC/C=C\C` would be very slightly more negative than `CC/C=C/C` but still close to zero.

Thus, a reasonable prediction for `CC/C=C\C` is:
**-0.012** (slightly more negative than `CC/C=C/C` due to reduced polarity from the trans configuration). 

(Note: The exact property is unclear, but this aligns with the trend in the given data.)

Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.8622350990159452
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - **CCOC(=O)C** (ethyl acetate, with an ester -COO- group) has a property value of **-0.0533036**.
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2** (a more complex ether/ester) has a value of **-0.41763908**.
   - Ethers (R-O-R') seem to have moderately negative or near-zero values unless other functional groups dominate.

2. **Hydrocarbon Chains**:
   - **CC#C** (propyne) has a value of **-0.82214039**, while **CCC#C** (1-butyne) has a value of **0.26270348**, suggesting that longer chains or branching can shift the property.
   - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)C** (a ketone with a long chain) has a value of **0.78834154**, indicating that chain length alone isn't the sole determinant.

3. **Simple Alcohols vs. Ethers**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) has a value of **0.48699701**, while **CCC(O)CC** (a longer-chain alcohol) has a value of **-0.86612721**. This suggests that ethers might behave similarly to alcohols but with less polarity.

4. **Symmetry and Simplicity**:
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cycloheptane) has a value of **0.06299629**, indicating that symmetric, non-polar molecules tend to have near-zero values.
   - **CCCOCC** is symmetric and non-polar (like cycloheptane) but has an oxygen, which might slightly lower the value.

### Prediction for CCCOCC:
- **CCCOCC** is diethyl ether, a simple, symmetric ether with no other functional groups. Given the examples:
  - Ethers tend to have values between **-0.4 and 0.0**.
  - Symmetric molecules like cycloheptane have near-zero values.
  - The oxygen in ethers likely reduces the property slightly compared to pure hydrocarbons.

Given these observations, I predict the property value for **CCCOCC** to be **-0.25**. This balances the near-zero trend of symmetric molecules with the slight negative influence of the ether oxygen.

### Final Answer:
**-0.25** (estimated based on trends in the data).

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.6034583561876027
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary amide** group (`N(C=O)`), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (as an acceptor).
   - It has two **phenyl rings** (aromatic systems: `c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`), which contribute to hydrophobicity and π-stacking interactions.
   - The **tert-butyl group** (`C(C)(C)C`) attached to one of the phenyl rings adds steric bulk and hydrophobicity.

2. **Similar Molecules in the Dataset**:
   - **Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl** (property = 0.91180899): Contains an aromatic system and a polar amide-like group (high value).
   - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = -0.07604972): Two phenyl rings but no polar groups (low value).
   - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property = 0.38841111): Contains a tertiary amide and aromatic systems (moderate value).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of the **tertiary amide** (`N(C=O)`) and **two phenyl rings** suggests moderate polarity but significant hydrophobicity due to the bulky tert-butyl group and aromatic systems.
   - The molecule lacks strongly polar or charged groups (e.g., `OH`, `COOH`, `NO2`), which would push the property toward extremes (very high or very low).

4. **Property Trends**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., amides, alcohols) and aromatic systems tend to have positive property values (e.g., 0.388, 0.911).
   - Nonpolar or weakly polar aromatic systems tend to have lower or negative values (e.g., -0.076, -0.655).
   - The tert-butyl group adds hydrophobicity, which may slightly reduce the property value compared to similar amide-containing molecules.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the polar amide and the hydrophobic aromatic/tert-butyl groups, the property value is likely **moderate and positive**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.45**  

This aligns with similar molecules like `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` (0.388) but accounts for the additional hydrophobicity of the tert-butyl group.
==================================================
Iteration: 45
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.8237735020311878
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Bromine (Br)**:
   - Molecules with Br often have positive property values (e.g., `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` = 0.733, `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` = 0.806, `c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1` = 0.900).
   - The Br substituent seems to increase the property value significantly.

2. **Amide Group (N-C=O)**:
   - Molecules with amide groups (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` = -0.603) tend to have negative values, but this is not always consistent (e.g., `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` = 0.621).
   - The amide group's effect may depend on other substituents.

3. **Aromatic Rings with Electron-Withdrawing/Directing Groups**:
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂, Br) often have higher property values (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` = -0.850 is an exception, but Br-substituted aromatics are consistently positive).
   - The combination of Br and an amide on an aromatic ring is not directly represented in the examples, but Br's strong positive influence likely dominates.

4. **Similar Structures**:
   - `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (property = 0.806) is very similar to the target molecule but lacks the amide group. The amide may slightly reduce the value compared to this.
   - `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` (property = -0.589) has an aromatic amine (no Br or amide), which is negative. The amide and Br in the target molecule should counteract this.

### Prediction:
Given the strong positive contribution of Br and the moderate influence of the amide group, the property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is likely **positive and close to 0.7**, but slightly less than `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (0.806) due to the amide's potential reducing effect.

### Final Predicted Value:
**0.65** (approximate, based on trends in the data).
==================================================
Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.8988508591651728
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns in the property values based on structural features. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): Property = **-0.57094044**
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene): Property = **0.49392036**
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene): Property = **-0.80420966**
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): Property = **-0.59656973**
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24** (a polyaromatic hydrocarbon): Property = **0.83424896**

   The property seems to vary significantly even for similar aromatic structures, but bulky alkyl groups (e.g., isopropyl) tend to lower the value.

2. **Isobutyl Group**:
   - **CC(C)CCO** (isobutyl alcohol): Property = **-0.92921127**
   - **CC(C)CCCO** (isopentyl alcohol): Property = **0.39706402**
   - **CC(C)CO** (isopropanol): Property = **0.52658147**

   The isobutyl group appears to contribute negatively when attached to polar groups (e.g., -OH), but its effect on aromatic systems is less clear.

3. **Combined Structure (Isobutylbenzene)**:
   - The molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** has an isobutyl group attached to a benzene ring. Comparing to similar structures:
     - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene) has a positive value (**0.49392036**), while **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene) has a negative value (**-0.80420966**).
     - The isobutyl group is bulkier than ethyl but less bulky than isopropyl. Its effect may lie between these two cases.

### Prediction:
Given the variability in the data, the property for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is likely **negative but less extreme than isopropyltoluene**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

This balances the slight negative trend from the isobutyl group and the aromatic ring's influence.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.9213541341480623
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Polar Substituents**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): **0.07848272**
   - **COc1ccccc1** (methoxybenzene): **-0.80806776**
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): **0.76167396**
   - **c1cncnc1** (polar heteroaromatic): **0.8994563**
   - **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (nonpolar polyaromatic): **0.91228467**

   Polar or electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂, CN, COOH) tend to increase the property value, while electron-donating groups (e.g., OCH₃, OH) often decrease it.

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - **Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1** (carbonyl in heterocycle): **-0.88001534**
   - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (cyclic ketone): **-0.89002725**
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (imide): **0.73774175**

   The property value seems to depend on the context: aliphatic carbonyls are often negative, while conjugated or aromatic carbonyls (e.g., in imides) can be positive.

3. **Benzaldehyde-Like Structures**:
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** is structurally similar to **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol, **0.07848272**) but lacks the phenol and amide groups. The aldehyde (CHO) is electron-withdrawing but less polar than NO₂ or CN.

### Prediction:
- The aldehyde group in **O=Cc1ccccc1** is moderately electron-withdrawing but not as strongly as NO₂ or CN (which give high positive values in the examples). 
- Compared to **COc1ccccc1** (**-0.80806776**, electron-donating OCH₃), the aldehyde should increase the property value but not as much as NO₂ or CN.
- A reasonable estimate is slightly negative or near zero, similar to **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (**0.07848272**) but without the additional OH group.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for O=Cc1ccccc1: -0.25**  
*(This is an educated guess based on the examples, likely falling between -0.5 and 0.0 due to the aldehyde's intermediate effect.)*

Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.6609063455523181
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains:
     - Two amide groups (`C(=O)N`), which are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
     - A nitro group (`N(=O)=O`), which is highly polar and electron-withdrawing.
     - An aromatic ring with an oxygen heteroatom (`c1ccc(o1)`), contributing to conjugation and polarity.
     - A secondary amine (`N`) linking the two amide groups, adding flexibility and potential for hydrogen bonding.

2. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - The nitro group and amide groups are strongly polar and electron-withdrawing, which would typically lower the property value (as seen in molecules with nitro groups in the examples, e.g., `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` with a value of `-0.264`).
   - The aromatic system with heteroatoms (O and N) adds complexity but also polarity.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) tend to have negative or low-positive property values (e.g., `-0.264` for `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2`).
   - Molecules with multiple amide groups (e.g., `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` has a value of `0.698`, but this also has a thiourea group, which is less polar than a nitro group).
   - The presence of the nitro group is likely the dominant feature here, pulling the value toward the negative side.

4. **Flexibility and Size**:
   - The molecule is rigid due to the aromatic ring and conjugated system, but the amide linkages add some flexibility. This is somewhat similar to `c1c(O)C2C(=O)C3cc(O)ccC3OC2cc1(OC)` (value `0.858`), but that molecule lacks a nitro group and has more hydrogen bond donors/acceptors.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group and the polar amide groups, the property value is likely **negative**. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction would be:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

This balances the negative contribution of the nitro group with the moderate polarity of the amide and aromatic systems.

Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.8820094397084011
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **-0.62584569**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene-like structure) has a property value of **0.69332608**.
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but with a single bond between the nitrogens instead of a double bond (hydrazine-like linkage instead of azo).

2. **Effect of Nitrogen Connectivity**:
   - Single-bonded nitrogen linkages (e.g., hydrazine derivatives) tend to reduce the property value compared to double-bonded (azo) linkages. For example:
     - **Nc1ccccc1**: -0.625 (single N-Ar bond)
     - **N=Nc1ccccc1**: higher (0.693 for the azo variant).
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** has two aromatic rings connected via a **N-N single bond**, which is less conjugated than the azo group, likely resulting in a lower property value than the azo analog but higher than a simple aniline.

3. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - The presence of two phenyl rings connected via a nitrogen group (like in **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**) gives a value of **0.69332608**.
   - Replacing the N=N with N-N would reduce conjugation and thus likely reduce the property value, but it would still be higher than a simple aniline due to the additional aromatic ring.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** should be **slightly lower than 0.69332608 (the azo analog)** but **higher than -0.62584569 (aniline)**. A reasonable estimate would be around **0.4 to 0.6**.

Looking at the examples, **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a carbazole-like structure) has a value of **0.2692054**, and **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is **0.69332608**. The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is intermediate in conjugation between these two.

Thus, the predicted property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is approximately:  
**0.45** (specific value: **0.45000000**).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an interpolation based on the given examples. If more context were provided, the prediction could be refined further.)

Iteration: 50
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 0.20515877894476767
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure (cyclohexane-like ring, **CCCC1**). 
   - It is a bicyclic system with two fused rings: a cyclohexane and a diketopiperazine-like ring (formed by the two amides).

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The amides are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (both as donors and acceptors), which typically reduces the property value (more negative). 
   - The cyclohexane ring is nonpolar, but the amides dominate the polarity.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = 0.62078243): This is also a cyclic diamide (similar to diketopiperazine) but with additional alkyl substituents. The property is positive but less so due to the polar amides.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = -0.39495118): This is a similar bicyclic diamide with alkyl substituents, and the property is negative due to the polar amides and lack of aromaticity.
   - **O=C1CCCN1** (property = -0.50799484): A simple lactam (cyclic amide), which is negative due to polarity.

4. **Aromaticity vs. Aliphaticity**:
   - The given molecule lacks aromaticity (unlike some examples with high positive values like **c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24** = 0.83424896, which is highly aromatic). 
   - Non-aromatic cyclic amides tend to have lower (more negative) property values.

5. **Symmetry and Rigidity**:
   - The molecule is symmetric and rigid, which may slightly increase the property value compared to less constrained polar molecules, but the amides still dominate.

### Prediction:
Given the strong polarity of the amides and the lack of aromaticity or large hydrophobic groups, the property value is likely **negative**. Comparing to similar cyclic diamides:
- The value should be between **-0.39495118** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC) and **-0.50799484** (O=C1CCCN1), but closer to the former because the ring system here is more constrained and symmetric.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2** is approximately **-0.45**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data, where polar/amide groups correlate with lower values and aromaticity/large hydrophobic groups correlate with higher values.)

Iteration: 51
SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.7926195850618718
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Heavy halogen substitution**: The molecule is a biphenyl derivative with **three chlorine atoms** (two on one ring, one on the other). From the examples, heavily halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have **moderate to high positive property values**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene) has a value of **0.65488507**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure) has a value of **0.34783999**.
   - **Ic1ccccc1** (iodobenzene) has a very high value of **0.90853638**, suggesting heavy halogens increase the property.

2. **Biphenyl core**: The molecule is a **biphenyl** (two benzene rings linked directly). From the examples:
   - **C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13** (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a value of **0.82405152**, suggesting fused/connected aromatic rings contribute positively.

3. **Symmetry and planarity**: The biphenyl structure is likely planar (or nearly so), which may enhance intermolecular interactions, potentially increasing the property.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The closest analog is **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, which has a value of **0.34783999**. However, this molecule has an additional **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group, which might sterically hinder interactions, reducing the property slightly.
- Our target molecule lacks this bulky group but has **more uniform chlorine substitution**, likely leading to **higher symmetry and stronger interactions**.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, the property value should be **higher than 0.34783999** (due to less steric hindrance) but **lower than 0.90853638** (since iodine is heavier/more polarizable than chlorine). A reasonable estimate is **between 0.6 and 0.8**.

A precise prediction based on the trend would be:  
**Predicted property value: 0.72**  

This aligns with the influence of halogens and biphenyl systems in the training examples.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.9106759134700942
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I will analyze the structural features of the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene) and compare them to the trends observed in the dataset to predict the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is a simple aromatic hydrocarbon with two ethyl groups (alkyl substituents) attached to a benzene ring. 
2. The molecule is non-polar, lacks functional groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -C=O, halogens), and has only alkyl substituents.

### Trends from the Dataset:
- **Non-polar alkyl/aromatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**, property = 0.14561996) tend to have small positive or near-zero property values.
- Molecules with **electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., -NO2, -C=O, halogens) often have negative property values.
- Molecules with **polar or hydrogen-bonding groups** (e.g., -OH, -NH2) show more variability but often lean negative.
- **Diethylbenzene** is structurally similar to **toluene (Cc1ccccc1)**, which has a property value of **-0.57094044**, but diethylbenzene has longer alkyl chains, which may slightly increase hydrophobicity and reduce polarity further.

### Prediction:
Given the absence of polar or electron-withdrawing groups and the presence of alkyl substituents, the property value is likely **small and positive**, similar to **CCCCCCc1ccccc1 (0.14561996)** but slightly lower due to the shorter alkyl chains.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**0.12** (estimated based on structural similarity and trends in the dataset). 

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. If the property is logP or a similar measure, this value aligns with expectations for a non-polar aromatic hydrocarbon.)*

Iteration: 53
SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 0.5850253743279435
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a **para-substituted benzene ring** with:
   - An **amino group (-NH2)** at position 1.
   - A **sulfonamide group (-S(N)(=O)=O)** at position 4 (para to the -NH2).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - The **-NH2 group** is electron-donating, which can increase electron density on the ring.
   - The **sulfonamide group (-S(N)(=O)=O)** is strongly electron-withdrawing due to the sulfonyl (=O) groups and the nitrogen substituent.

3. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - The combination of an electron-donating (-NH2) and electron-withdrawing (-S(N)(=O)=O) group in para positions creates a push-pull effect, increasing polarity.
   - Sulfonamides are typically polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (both as donors and acceptors).

### Comparison with Given Examples:
- **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (property = -0.28668502): This is a nitroaniline (electron-donating -NH2 and electron-withdrawing -NO2 in para positions). The sulfonamide group in the target molecule is even more polar/electron-withdrawing than -NO2, so we might expect a more negative property value.
- **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12** (property = -0.0031153): A purine-like structure with hydrogen-bonding groups. The sulfonamide is more polar, so the target molecule should be more negative.
- **Oc1ccncc1** (property = 0.15278022): A less polar heterocycle, so the target molecule should be more negative.
- **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is more similar to **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** but with a stronger electron-withdrawing group.

### Predicted Property:
Given the stronger electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonamide group compared to nitro, the property value should be more negative than -0.28668502 (nitroaniline) but not as extreme as highly hydrophobic or nonpolar molecules (e.g., **ClCBr** at -0.59981824). 

A reasonable estimate would be around **-0.35 to -0.45**. 

### Final Prediction:
**-0.40** (specific value within the expected range). 

This balances the polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity of the sulfonamide with the electron-donating effect of the -NH2 group.

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: -0.6754558930389613
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34`, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the examples provided.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings, forming a structure similar to pyrene (but not exactly pyrene, as the connectivity differs). It has a highly conjugated, planar, and aromatic system. 

### Comparison with Examples:
From the given examples, we can observe trends:
1. **Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives)**:
   - `COc1ccccc1` (anisole): -0.80806776
   - `CC(O)c1ccccc1` (ethylphenol): 0.82038718
   - `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` (polycyclic aromatic): -0.51881103
   - `Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32` (another PAH): -0.74950152
   - `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` (large PAH): -0.85254187

2. **Highly conjugated systems**:
   - These tend to have negative property values, especially when they are large and lack polar substituents.

3. **Substituent effects**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, NO2) can shift the property positively or negatively depending on context.
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., OCH3, OH) can also influence the property.

### Specific Example Matching:
The closest examples are:
- `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12`: -0.51881103
- `Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32`: -0.74950152
- `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54`: -0.85254187

Our molecule `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34` is a fully conjugated, symmetric PAH with no substituents. It is larger than benzene but smaller than some of the more extended PAHs in the examples. 

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Larger PAHs tend to have more negative values.
- The absence of polar substituents suggests a negative value.
- The symmetry and conjugation are similar to the other PAHs with negative values.

A reasonable estimate would be between -0.7 and -0.9. Comparing to the closest examples, I predict:

**Predicted property value: -0.78**

Iteration: 55
SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 0.8349939209373344
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, aromaticity, halogenation, and overall molecular complexity. The molecule in question is:

**Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**

### Key structural features:
1. **Multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)**: These contribute to hydrogen bonding and polarity, which in the examples often correlate with intermediate to high property values (e.g., `Oc1cccc(O)c1` has `-0.797`, but other hydroxyl-rich molecules like `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl` have `0.428`).
2. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains fused aromatic systems with electron-rich oxygen substituents, which may increase the property value (e.g., `Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4` has `0.847`).
3. **Carbonyl group (C=O)**: This adds polarity and may increase the property value (e.g., `O=C1CNC(=O)N1` has `0.569`).
4. **Ether linkage (Oc)**: This is present in some examples with moderate to high values (e.g., `COc2c1occc1cc3ccc(=O)oc23` has `0.768`).

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- The molecule resembles polyphenolic or flavonoid-like structures, which in the examples tend to have property values in the range of `0.4` to `0.9` when hydroxyl groups and aromaticity are prominent.
- The presence of multiple hydroxyls and a carbonyl group suggests a higher value, but the lack of halogens (which often increase the value, e.g., `ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl` has `-0.795` while `ClC(Br)Br` has `0.541`) may temper this.

### Predicted property value:
Given the above, the molecule likely has a **property value in the range of `0.6` to `0.8`**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.725**  

This balances the contributions of hydroxyl groups, aromaticity, and carbonyl polarity while accounting for the absence of halogens or highly electron-withdrawing groups.

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 0.7748983207307939
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-containing groups (P=O, P=S)**:
   - Molecules with phosphate/thiophosphate groups (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) tend to have **high positive values** (e.g., 0.905).
   - The presence of `P=O` or `P=S` often increases the property value.

2. **Polar functional groups**:
   - Amides (`NC=O`) and esters (`COC=O`) often reduce the property value (e.g., `CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2` has -0.800).
   - However, when combined with phosphorus, the effect may be less negative.

3. **Chlorine atoms**:
   - Chlorine substitution often increases the property (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` has -0.804, but this is likely due to other factors).

4. **Thioether (S-C) groups**:
   - The presence of sulfur (e.g., `Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1`) tends to **decrease** the property (e.g., -0.880).

5. **Hybrid structures**:
   - Molecules with both phosphorus and polar groups (e.g., `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) still have **high positive values** (0.767).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is:  
**COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**  
- Contains a **phosphate group (P=O)** → Likely increases the property.
- Has an **amide (NC=O)** → Likely decreases the property.
- Includes a **thioether (S-C)** → Likely decreases the property.
- No aromaticity or halogens → Neutral effect.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (0.767) has P=O and Cl, but our molecule lacks Cl and has an amide instead.
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (0.905) has P=S and Cl, but our molecule has P=O and no Cl.
- `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` (0.914) has P=S and amide, but our molecule has P=O and simpler structure.

Given the **P=O group's strong positive contribution** and the **amide/thioether's moderate negative contribution**, the net effect should still be **positive but lower** than the high values seen in phosphorus-heavy molecules with halogens.

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the balance of effects, a reasonable estimate is:  
**0.45** (moderate positive value, similar to `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (0.184) but higher due to P=O).

However, given the strong influence of P=O, a more accurate prediction would be closer to **0.60**.

### Final Answer:
**0.60** (rounded to two decimal places).

Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.9169935745350005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds (Cl, Br, F)**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): Property = **-0.86616937**
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (dichlorophenol): Property = **0.89785159**
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (chloroaniline): Property = **-0.36634025**
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane): Property = **-0.27775557**
   - **CCCCBr** (bromobutane): Property = **0.89809402**

   Halogenated compounds show a wide range of property values, but the presence of multiple halogens (especially Cl) tends to push the value toward the extremes (either highly positive or negative). 

2. **Alkenes (C=C)**:
   - **CC1=CCCCC1** (methylcyclohexene): Property = **0.84566012**
   - **CCC(=C)C** (isoprene-like structure): Property = **-0.93025717**
   - **CCC=O** (butanal): Property = **0.26910917**

   Alkenes do not show a clear trend, but conjugation or substitution can influence the property.

3. **Small, Symmetric Molecules**:
   - **Cl\C=C/Cl** is a small, symmetric molecule with two Cl atoms on a double bond. This is similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (dichlorophenol, property = **0.89785159**), which also has two Cl atoms but on an aromatic ring. The symmetry and electronegativity of Cl may contribute to a higher property value.

4. **Polarity and Electronegativity**:
   - The Cl atoms introduce polarity, and the C=C double bond adds rigidity. This combination might lead to a moderately high property value, similar to other small polar halogenated compounds.

### Prediction for Cl\C=C/Cl:
Given the examples, small halogenated alkenes with symmetry tend to have property values in the **positive range**. Comparing to similar molecules:
- **CCBr** (bromoethane): **-0.27775557** (small, single halogen)
- **CCCCBr** (bromobutane): **0.89809402** (longer chain, single halogen)
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (dichlorophenol): **0.89785159** (two Cl atoms, aromatic)

For **Cl\C=C/Cl**, the symmetry and two Cl atoms likely push the property toward the higher end, but not as extreme as dichlorophenol. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.45** (similar to small, symmetric halogenated alkenes). 

### Final Answer:
**0.45** (estimated based on trends in the given data).

Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 0.6158730782647259
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have negative or near-zero property values unless they have strongly polar or electron-withdrawing substituents (e.g., nitro groups, halogens, or carbonyls).
   - Example: `CNc1ccccc1` (N-methylaniline) has a property value of **-0.4239563**.
   - Example: `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43` (a polyaromatic hydrocarbon) has a value of **-0.85254187**.

2. **Heteroaromatic Systems**:
   - Nitrogen-containing heteroaromatics (e.g., pyridine-like structures) often have slightly higher property values than pure hydrocarbons, especially if the nitrogen is in the ring (due to polarity).
   - Example: `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (a purine-like structure) has a value of **0.51022159**.
   - Example: `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` (a fused nitrogen heterocycle) has a value of **0.83275594**.

3. **Pyridine-Specific Trends**:
   - Pyridine (`c1ccncc1`) is a simple 6-membered heteroaromatic ring with one nitrogen. It is more polar than benzene but lacks additional functional groups that might push the property value higher (e.g., nitro or carbonyl groups).
   - Comparing to similar molecules:
     - `CNc1ccccc1` (N-methylaniline, aromatic with a nitrogen substituent): **-0.4239563**.
     - `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (nitrogen-rich heterocycle): **0.51022159**.
     - `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` (fused nitrogen heterocycle): **0.83275594**.

### Prediction for Pyridine (`c1ccncc1`):
- Pyridine is more polar than benzene but less polar than nitrogen-rich fused systems. Its property value is likely between the simple aromatic (`-0.4239563`) and the nitrogen-rich heterocycles (`0.51022159`).
- Given the lack of additional functional groups, the value should be closer to the lower end of this range but still slightly higher than pure hydrocarbons.

### Estimated Property Value:
**0.15** (slightly positive due to the nitrogen's polarity but not as high as fused or multi-nitrogen systems).

### Note:
This is an educated guess based on the examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or experimental data would be needed. However, the value likely falls in the range of **0.1 to 0.3**. 

**Final Prediction: 0.15**

Iteration: 59
SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: -0.9154075715420913
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Polar functional groups**: 
   - Hydroxyl groups (`OCC(O)CO-`) suggest some polarity (similar to polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`, which has a value of **0.133**).
   - Ester (`COC(=O)-`) is present, which is moderately polar (e.g., `CCOC(=O)CC` has **0.664**).
   - Aromatic amine (`Nc2ccnc3...`) may contribute polarity/hydrogen bonding.

2. **Aromatic systems**: 
   - Benzene (`c1ccccc1`) and fused heteroaromatic rings (`Nc2ccnc3...`) are present. Aromaticity often increases the property value (e.g., `c1ccc2cnccc2c1` has **0.821**).

3. **Chlorine substitution**: 
   - A chloro group (`Cl`) on the aromatic ring is electron-withdrawing (e.g., `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` has **-0.515**, but `ClCC#N` has **0.371**). The effect depends on context.

4. **Hybridization of nitrogen**: 
   - The `Nc2ccnc3` nitrogen is part of a pyridine-like ring, which is less basic than aliphatic amines but still polar.

5. **Overall size and complexity**: 
   - The molecule is larger and more complex than most examples, with multiple functional groups. Larger conjugated systems (e.g., polyaromatics) tend to have lower values (e.g., **-0.852** for a large fused system), but polarity can offset this.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The ester + aromatic amine + hydroxyl combination is somewhat similar to `CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1OC(C)C` (value: **0.747**), but with more polar groups.
- The fused aromatic system with nitrogen resembles `c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3` (value: **0.904**), but the chloro substitution and additional polar groups may reduce the value slightly.
- The polyol fragment (`OCC(O)CO-`) is less polar than `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (value: **0.134**), but the rest of the molecule dominates.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of polar groups (increasing the value) and the larger aromatic system (potentially decreasing it), the predicted value is likely in the **0.5 to 0.8 range**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 0.72**  

This aligns with the contributions from the ester, aromatic amine, and hydroxyl groups, while accounting for the chloro substitution and size.

Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.8075244500354346
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The molecule in question is **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), which is a linear aliphatic alcohol with the structure CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-OH.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aliphatic Chains with Polar Groups**: 
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (butylbenzene) has a property value of **0.17346761**.
   - **CCCCC(=O)CCCC** (5-nonanone) has a property value of **0.22769463**.
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tertiary alcohol) has a high value of **0.91754841**, likely due to branching and sterics.
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol) has a value of **-0.66994009**, suggesting cyclic alcohols may have lower values.
   - **CCC(C)Cl** (branched alkyl halide) has a very low value of **-0.91091113**, but this is likely due to the Cl substituent.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CCOC=O** (ethyl formate) has a value of **0.65126135**.
   - **COC=O** (methyl formate) has a value of **-0.92668272**, suggesting small esters may have lower values.
   - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)...** (complex ester) has a high value of **0.8809735**, likely due to size and complexity.

3. **Linear Alcohols**:
   - No exact linear alcohol examples are provided, but **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (branched alcohol) has a high value, while **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cyclic alcohol) has a low value. Linear alcohols like **CCCCCO** are likely intermediate.

### Prediction for **CCCCCO**:
- The molecule is a linear alcohol with moderate polarity and no branching or cyclic constraints.
- Compared to **CCCc1ccccc1** (0.173) and **CCCCC(=O)CCCC** (0.227), **CCCCCO** is likely similar or slightly higher due to the presence of the hydroxyl group.
- However, it is less bulky than **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (0.917), so the value should be lower.
- A reasonable estimate is between **0.2 and 0.4**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **CCCCCO** is approximately **0.35**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For precise predictions, a model trained on more data would be needed.)

Iteration: 61
SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: -0.5959293092934943
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Structural Analysis of the Molecule:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **fused ring system (1,3-oxathiolane)** with a **sulfone group (S(=O)(=O))** and a **carbonyl group (C=O)** attached to an **aniline (Nc2ccccc2)** moiety. 
   - The sulfone group is highly polar and electron-withdrawing.
   - The carbonyl group (amide-like, C(=O)N) is also polar and contributes to dipole moments.
   - The aromatic ring (c2ccccc2) adds hydrophobicity but is balanced by the polar substituents.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Sulfone (S(=O)(=O))**: Present in other molecules like `CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C` (property = -0.896) and `CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = 0.385). Sulfones tend to have mixed effects depending on the rest of the structure.
   - **Amide (C(=O)N)**: Seen in `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1` (property = 0.878) and `O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (property = 0.738). Amides often correlate with positive property values due to polarity and H-bonding.
   - **Fused heterocycle (oxathiolane)**: Similar to cyclic structures like `Sc2nc1ccccc1s2` (property = -0.365), but the sulfone here is more polarizing.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The molecule is somewhat analogous to `O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (property = 0.738), which has two aromatic rings and polar amide/carbonyl groups. Here, the sulfone may reduce the property slightly compared to the carbonyl.
   - The presence of the **aniline (Nc2ccccc2)** is similar to `Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2` (property = 0.697), suggesting a positive contribution.
   - The **sulfone** might pull the value down slightly, as in `CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C` (-0.896), but the amide and aromaticity counterbalance this.

### Predicted Property:
Given the polar amide, aromaticity, and sulfone, the molecule likely has a **moderately positive property value**, but not as high as pure amides or as low as sulfone-dominated structures. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.45**  

This balances the positive contributions of the amide/aromatic system (~0.7) and the negative pull of the sulfone (~-0.3). The exact value could vary, but this aligns with the trends in the examples.

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 0.5854621909224208
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and analyzing the structural features of the given molecule, I predict the property value for:

**COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: Present in the benzene ring, which in the examples tends to correlate with negative property values (e.g., `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` has a value of `-0.91735322`). However, some nitro-containing molecules like `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` have positive values (`0.50170033`), suggesting context matters.

2. **Ester Groups (COC=O)**: The molecule has two ester groups, which are polar and often associated with negative values (e.g., `CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC` has `-0.5648414`).

3. **Aromatic System with Substituents**: The presence of a benzene ring with both nitro and ester groups introduces electronic effects (electron-withdrawing), which may lower the property value.

4. **Heterocyclic Nitrogen (NC=)**: The nitrogen in the non-aromatic ring may contribute to polarity, similar to examples like `CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O` (`-0.71324915`).

5. **Overall Polarity**: The molecule is highly polar due to multiple functional groups, which aligns with negative property values in the dataset.

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the combined effects of the nitro group, esters, and aromatic system, the predicted value is likely in the **negative range**, similar to other polar, nitro-containing molecules. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.75**  

*(This is an approximate interpolation based on the examples, likely between -0.7 and -0.8.)*

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.6789814381673658
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). 
   - The presence of multiple polar amide groups suggests some polarity, but the cyclopropane ring adds rigidity and reduces flexibility.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **Amides**: Molecules with amide groups (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` with a value of `-0.21554929`) tend to have moderately negative values, but this depends on other substituents.
   - **Rigid Rings**: Cyclic structures like `C1CCCCC1` (cyclohexane) have a high value (`0.75099445`), but this is non-polar. The cyclopropane here is strained and may not behave similarly.
   - **Polarity Balance**: The two amides likely dominate, pulling the value toward the negative side, but the compact structure may offset this slightly.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (value: `-0.91273048`) has multiple polar/electronegative groups and is very negative.
   - `CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (value: `-0.40278902`) has carbonyls and rigidity but is less polar than our molecule.

### Prediction:
Given the two strongly polar amide groups and the rigid cyclopropane ring, the molecule is likely to have a **moderately negative property value**, similar to other polar, constrained systems. A reasonable estimate would be between `-0.4` and `-0.6`.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: -0.52**  
*(This aligns with the trend of polar, cyclic amide-containing molecules in the dataset.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 0.7545864167801769
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the analysis:

1. **Simple alkanes** (e.g., `CCCCC`) tend to have negative property values around **-0.93**.
2. **Chlorinated alkanes/aromatics** (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1` at **-0.881**, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` at **-0.921**) also tend to have negative values, often more negative than their non-chlorinated counterparts.
3. **Small chlorinated molecules** (e.g., `ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl` at **-0.198**) can have less negative values, but this depends on complexity and substitution.
4. The molecule `ClCC` is a very simple chlorinated alkane (chloroethane). Comparing it to similar small chlorinated alkanes/alkenes in the dataset:
   - `CC#N` (a small nitrile) has a value of **-0.673**.
   - `Clc1ccccc1I` (chloroiodobenzene) has **-0.534**.
   - `ClC1=C(Cl)C2...` (a heavily chlorinated complex molecule) has **-0.198**.

Given that `ClCC` is simpler than most of the chlorinated examples but still has a polar C-Cl bond, its property value is likely **less negative** than larger alkanes or heavily chlorinated aromatics but **more negative** than very small polar molecules like `CC#N`. 

### Predicted property value for `ClCC`:  
**Approximately -0.55** (between -0.673 and -0.198, closer to -0.673 due to simplicity). 

This is an estimate based on the trend that smaller chlorinated alkanes have moderately negative values, while larger or more substituted chlorinated molecules vary widely.

Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: -0.22106373716998265
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (n1)** substituted with a **trichloromethyl group (C(Cl)(Cl)Cl)** and a **chlorine atom (Cl)** on the aromatic ring.
2. **Electron-Withdrawing Groups**: 
   - The **trichloromethyl group (-CCl₃)** is strongly electron-withdrawing due to the inductive effect of the chlorines.
   - The **chlorine substituent (Cl)** on the pyridine ring is also moderately electron-withdrawing (inductive effect dominates over resonance in this case).
3. **Aromatic System**: Pyridine is an electron-deficient heteroaromatic ring, and the additional electron-withdrawing groups will further polarize the system.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules in the Dataset:
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl**: This molecule has two chlorinated benzene rings linked directly. Its property value is **-0.79261959**, likely due to the symmetric, non-polar nature of the structure despite the chlorines.
- **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2**: This is a biphenyl with one chlorine substituent, and its property value is **0.86234855**, possibly due to less electron withdrawal and more conjugation.
- **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O**: This molecule has a trichloromethyl group and other polar features, and its property value is **0.91771959**, suggesting that the trichloromethyl group combined with other polar groups can lead to higher values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Trichloromethyl Group Impact**: When combined with other polar or conjugated systems (e.g., aromatic rings), the **-CCl₃** group tends to increase the property value (see examples with high positive values).
2. **Pyridine vs. Benzene**: Pyridine is more electron-deficient than benzene, which may further enhance the effect of electron-withdrawing groups.
3. **Chlorine Substitution**: Multiple chlorines on an aromatic ring can either decrease (if symmetric/non-polar) or increase (if asymmetric/polarizing) the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
- A **pyridine ring** (electron-deficient),
- A **trichloromethyl group** (strongly electron-withdrawing),
- An additional **chlorine substituent** (moderately electron-withdrawing),

the molecule is likely to have a **moderately high positive property value**, similar to other structures with **-CCl₃** and polar aromatic systems. 

From the examples, the closest analog is **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O (0.91771959)**, but our target molecule lacks the additional polar groups (like S=O or C=O), so the value should be lower. 

Another close example is **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2 (0.86234855)**, but our molecule has stronger electron withdrawal due to **-CCl₃** and pyridine. 

Thus, balancing these effects, the predicted property value for **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** is approximately:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.45**  

(Reasoning: Higher than symmetric polychlorinated aromatics but lower than structures with additional polar functional groups). 

### Final Answer:
**0.45**
==================================================
Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: 0.6261569361715887
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Hydroxyl Group (-OH)**:
   - Molecules with an -OH group tend to have property values that are not extremely negative or positive, often in the mid-range. For example:
     - `CCCC(O)CCC` has a value of **0.10596231**.
     - `CC(O)c1ccccc1` has a value of **0.82038718**.
     - `CCC(C)CCO` has a value of **0.52442212**.
     - `CCC(CC)CO` has a value of **0.63820306**.
   - The presence of -OH seems to push the property toward positive values, especially when the rest of the molecule is aliphatic (no strong electron-withdrawing or aromatic groups).

2. **Aliphatic Chains**:
   - Simple aliphatic chains without -OH tend to have negative values (e.g., `CCCCCCCCl` has -0.82116326, `CCCC1CCCC1` has -0.91879724).
   - Adding -OH to an aliphatic chain tends to increase the property value (as seen above).

3. **Branching**:
   - Branching doesn't seem to drastically affect the property if -OH is present. For example:
     - `CCC(C)CCO` (branched) has **0.52442212**.
     - `CCC(CC)CO` (branched) has **0.63820306**.
   - The property is more influenced by the -OH group than the branching.

### Prediction for CCCCC(C)O:
- This is a branched aliphatic chain (`CCCCC(C)O`) with a terminal -OH group, similar to `CCC(C)CCO` and `CCC(CC)CO`.
- The property values for such molecules in the examples range from **0.52442212** to **0.63820306**.
- Given that `CCCCC(C)O` is slightly longer than `CCC(C)CCO` but similarly branched, its value should be in this range, likely closer to the middle or higher end because of the longer chain.

### Final Prediction:
A reasonable estimate for the property value of **CCCCC(C)O** is **~0.60**. 

For specificity, let's choose **0.60** (rounded from the trend of similar molecules). 

However, looking more closely:
- `CCC(C)CCO` (5 carbons + branch): **0.52442212**
- `CCC(CC)CO` (6 carbons + branch): **0.63820306**
- `CCCCC(C)O` is 6 carbons + branch, very similar to `CCC(CC)CO`, so the value should be close to **0.63820306**. 

Thus, the predicted property value is **0.63** (rounded slightly higher due to the longer chain). 

But to match the precision of the given examples, we can provide it as **0.63**. 

However, since the examples are very precise, let's interpolate more carefully:
- `CCC(C)CCO`: 0.524
- `CCC(CC)CO`: 0.638
- `CCCCC(C)O` is structurally almost identical to `CCC(CC)CO` (both are 6-carbon branched alcohols), so the value should be very close to **0.638**. 

Thus, the most accurate prediction is: **0.638**. 

But to match the precision of the examples, we can give it as **0.63820306** (same as `CCC(CC)CO`). 

However, since the exact structure isn't identical, let's average the two closest analogs:
- `CCC(C)CCO`: 0.524
- `CCC(CC)CO`: 0.638
Average: ~0.58, but `CCCCC(C)O` is more similar to `CCC(CC)CO`, so leaning toward **0.63**. 

Given the uncertainty, I'll predict: **0.63**. 

But to be precise, the closest analog is `CCC(CC)CO` with **0.63820306**, so the prediction is: 

**Predicted property value for CCCCC(C)O: 0.63820306** (same as `CCC(CC)CO` due to nearly identical structure). 

### Final Answer:
**0.63820306**

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.841858521130745
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic rings with halogen substitutions**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl): Property = -0.09210105
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene): Property = 0.89276101
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (2,5-dichlorophenol): Property = 0.89276101
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (2,5-dichlorophenol, same as above): Property = 0.89785159
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl** (chloroform): Property = 0.22904667
   - **ClC(Cl)Cl** (chloroform-like): Property = 0.22904667

   Halogenated aromatics with **two halogens in para positions** (e.g., 1,4-dichlorobenzene) tend to have **high positive property values (~0.89)**. In contrast, **disubstituted biphenyls** (e.g., dichlorobiphenyl) have **lower or negative values**.

2. **Bromine vs. Chlorine**:
   - Bromine is heavier and more polarizable than chlorine, but the examples don't include many brominated aromatics. However, halogens in similar positions (para) seem to behave similarly regardless of Cl/Br.

3. **Other features**:
   - **Non-aromatic halogenated alkanes** (e.g., ClCCl, ClC(Cl)Cl) have **moderate positive values (0.2-0.9)**.
   - **Polar groups (e.g., OH, NO2)** can increase the property value when combined with halogens (e.g., 2,5-dichlorophenol ~0.89).

### Prediction for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1:
- This is **1,4-dibromobenzene**, structurally analogous to **1,4-dichlorobenzene** (Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1), which has a property value of **0.89276101**.
- Bromine is larger but similarly electronegative, so the property should be close to the dichloro analog.
- No conflicting functional groups are present to lower the value.

### Final Prediction:
The property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is likely very close to that of 1,4-dichlorobenzene. Given the consistency in the examples for para-disubstituted halogenated aromatics, the predicted value is:

**0.89** (approximating to two decimal places for consistency with the examples). 

For higher precision, we can match it exactly to the dichloro analog:  
**Predicted property = 0.89276101**.  

(Note: If the property is something like "water solubility" or "logP," the high value suggests low solubility or high hydrophobicity, but the exact property is unspecified here.)

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: -0.8745443427326716
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples. 

### Structural Analysis:
1. The molecule is a **polychlorinated biphenyl derivative** with chlorine atoms substituted on both aromatic rings. 
2. It is highly similar to the second example in the list: **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**, which has a property value of **0.61945864**.
   - The main difference is that the given molecule has fewer chlorine substitutions (some positions are unsubstituted or have fewer Cl atoms).
3. Polychlorinated aromatic structures in the dataset tend to have **positive property values**, typically in the range of **0.5 to 0.9**, unless other functional groups significantly alter the property.

### Comparison with Other Examples:
- The second example (fully chlorinated biphenyl) has a value of **0.61945864**.
- Another chlorinated aromatic, **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, has a value of **0.52098862**.
- The given molecule has **less chlorination** than the second example but **more than simple substituted aromatics**, so its value should be **slightly lower than 0.61945864** but still in the **0.5 to 0.6 range**.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity and trends in the dataset, the predicted property value for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl** is approximately:

**0.58** (estimated between 0.55 and 0.60, closer to the fully chlorinated biphenyl example but slightly lower due to fewer Cl substitutions). 

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an interpolation based on the given examples.)*

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: -0.8683914063858583
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings (phenyl groups) and a phosphate group (OP(=O)(...)), which is polar and can influence the property.
2. **Substituents**: It has methyl groups (C) attached to aromatic rings and a phosphate ester linkage (OP(=O)(O...)), which introduces polarity and potential hydrogen-bonding capacity.
3. **Size and Complexity**: The molecule is relatively large and has a branched structure with multiple aromatic and polar components.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Polar/Aromatic Molecules with Negative Values**: 
  - Molecules like **CC12CC(=O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO** (-0.904) and **Nc1ccccc1O** (-0.905) have polar groups (carbonyl, hydroxyl, amine) and aromaticity, leading to negative values.
  - The phosphate group in the given molecule is similarly polar, but the presence of bulky aromatic substituents may moderate its effect.
- **Aromatic Molecules with Moderately Positive Values**: 
  - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (0.655) and **COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (0.641) are aromatic with halogens or ether groups, giving moderately positive values.
  - The given molecule has aromaticity and ether-like (phosphate ester) linkages but lacks strongly electron-withdrawing groups like halogens.
- **Large, Branched, or Sterically Hindered Molecules**: 
  - **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O** (0.910) is large and branched but has polar groups, leading to a high positive value.
  - The given molecule is similarly large but has more polar phosphate groups, which may pull the value lower.

### Key Observations:
- The phosphate group is polar and could contribute to a negative value, but the bulky aromatic substituents may offset this.
- No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like NO2 or CN) are present, so the value is unlikely to be highly negative.
- The molecule is more complex than simple aromatics but less polar than some highly negative examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance between polarity (phosphate) and bulkiness (aromatic substituents), the predicted value is likely **moderately negative**. A reasonable estimate is:

**-0.45**  

This balances the polar phosphate contribution with the steric and aromatic effects observed in similar molecules from the examples.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.003237759638408553
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: Present in the aromatic ring. From the examples, molecules with CF3 (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C`) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.92763208). This suggests CF3 may contribute to lowering the value.
2. **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The aromatic ring has an electron-withdrawing CF3 and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle attached. Similar structures (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`) have negative values (-0.28668502).
3. **Chlorinated heterocycle**: The 5-membered ring has two chlorine atoms and a carbonyl group. Chlorine substituents often appear in molecules with negative values (e.g., `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` has -0.81692263), but the carbonyl might offset this slightly.
4. **Polar functional groups**: The amide-like linkage (N adjacent to carbonyl) and polar Cl/CF3 groups suggest moderate polarity, which could push the value toward the middle of the range.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule combines features of **electron-withdrawing groups (CF3, Cl, carbonyl)** and **aromatic systems with polar substituents**, similar to some negative-valued examples.
- However, the presence of multiple halogens and a rigid heterocycle might make it less negative than purely aliphatic chlorinated compounds (e.g., -0.81692263) but more negative than simple nitroaromatics (e.g., -0.15364572).

### Predicted Value:
Given these observations, the property value is likely **negative but not extremely so**, falling between -0.5 and -0.2. A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.42**.  

This balances the effects of the CF3, chlorines, and carbonyl while aligning with trends in the provided data.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.8089058850881218
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: This molecule has two nitro groups and a property value of **0.74848297**.
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2**: Contains a nitro-like group (N(=O)=O is not present, but similar electronegative groups) with a value of **0.23678465**.
   - The nitro group tends to increase the property value when attached to an aromatic ring, especially if the molecule is otherwise non-polar or moderately polar.

2. **Methoxy Group (OCH3)**:
   - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC**: Contains two methoxy groups and has a value of **-0.89342714**, but this is likely due to the ester groups dominating the property.
   - **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has one methoxy group, which is less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group, so the nitro group's effect will likely dominate.

3. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro) tend to have higher property values (e.g., **0.74848297** for the dinitrobenzene).
   - Aromatic rings with electron-donating groups (like methoxy) tend to have lower or moderate values unless paired with strong electron-withdrawing groups.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: Two nitro groups, value = **0.74848297**.
   - **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: One nitro and one methoxy group. The methoxy is electron-donating, which may slightly counteract the nitro group's effect compared to the dinitrobenzene.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group and tends to increase the property value.
- The methoxy group is electron-donating but less impactful than the nitro group.
- The molecule is aromatic, and the nitro group is directly attached to the ring (similar to the dinitrobenzene example but with one fewer nitro group).

The property value for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is likely slightly lower than the dinitrobenzene example but still positive and moderately high. 

### Estimated Value:
Given the dinitrobenzene value is **0.74848297**, and this molecule has one nitro group and a methoxy group, a reasonable estimate would be in the range of **0.5 to 0.7**. 

Looking at other examples with single nitro-like groups:
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2**: **0.23678465** (less direct nitro influence).
- **O=Cc1ccco1**: **0.39115055** (carbonyl instead of nitro).

A balanced estimate for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** would be around **0.6**. 

### Final Prediction:
**0.62** (specific value based on interpolation of similar examples). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is:  
**0.62** (approximate, based on trends in the given data).

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: -0.9305297507628651
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to identify trends:

### Given Molecule:
**ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**

This is a highly chlorinated polycyclic structure with multiple chlorine atoms attached to a rigid, saturated ring system. The molecule resembles a chlorinated hydrocarbon with significant steric and electronic effects due to the high chlorine content.

### Observations from Examples:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Molecules:**
   - **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl (Hexachlorocyclohexane)**: Property value = **0.60181887**
     - This molecule has 6 chlorine atoms on a cyclohexane ring, showing a positive property value (~0.6).
   - **Clc1ccccc1 (Chlorobenzene)**: Property value = **-0.88146129**
     - Single chlorine on benzene gives a negative value.
   - **ClCCCl (1,2-Dichloroethane)**: Property value = **-0.30639072**
     - Two chlorines on a flexible chain give a less negative value than chlorobenzene.
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl (Dichlorophenol)**: Property value = **0.89785159**
     - Chlorines + hydroxyl group lead to a high positive value.

2. **Trends:**
   - Multiple chlorines on **aliphatic (flexible) systems** tend to give **moderate positive values** (e.g., hexachlorocyclohexane = 0.60).
   - Multiple chlorines on **aromatic systems** tend to give **negative values** (e.g., chlorobenzene = -0.88).
   - The presence of other functional groups (e.g., -OH) can significantly alter the property.

3. **Given Molecule:**
   - The structure is a **polycyclic aliphatic system** (like a chlorinated steroid or adamantane derivative) with **8 chlorine atoms**.
   - This is even more chlorinated than hexachlorocyclohexane (6 Cl), and the rigid polycyclic framework may enhance the electronic effects of chlorine.

### Prediction:
Given the high chlorine count and aliphatic polycyclic nature, the property value should be **more positive than hexachlorocyclohexane (0.60)** but not as extreme as dichlorophenol (0.89). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.75**  

This aligns with the trend that highly chlorinated aliphatic systems have positive values, and the additional chlorines here further increase it. 

### Final Answer:
**0.75**
==================================================
Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.21688372452252827
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NO₂, -Br, -Cl, -C=O, -O-) tend to have higher (more positive) property values.
   - Nonpolar or hydrophobic groups (e.g., long aliphatic chains, -C#C, -I) often correlate with lower (more negative) values.
   - Ethers (e.g., -O-) and esters (e.g., -COO-) tend to have moderate to high positive values.

2. **Specific Examples**:
   - **COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67** (complex ester/ether): **0.656**.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl ester with amine): **-0.803** (note the amine may lower the value).
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2** (ester + ether): **-0.418**.
   - **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate): Not in the list, but similar to **CCCOC=O**.

3. **Propyl Formate (CCCOC=O)**:
   - This is an ester (R-COO-R') with a short aliphatic chain (propyl group) and a formyl group (C=O).
   - Esters in the examples have varied values, but simple esters like ethyl acetate (not explicitly listed) would likely have a moderate positive value.
   - The absence of strongly polar or charged groups (like -NO₂ or -OH) suggests the value won't be extremely high or low.

### Prediction:
Given the ester functionality and the lack of strongly polar or nonpolar substituents, the property value for **CCCOC=O** is likely in the **moderate positive range**, similar to other simple esters in the dataset. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

This is based on:
- Esters with no additional polar/nonpolar groups tend to cluster around 0.4–0.6 (e.g., **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** at 0.385, **Clc1ccccc1Cl** at 0.655).
- The propyl chain is not long enough to significantly lower the value (long aliphatic chains push values negative).
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.7018513556559303
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC`  
This is a fatty acid ester with a long hydrocarbon chain (`CCCCCCCCC`), a carbonyl group (`C=O`), and an ethoxy group (`OCC`). 

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon chains (e.g., `CC`, `CCCCCC`, `CCCCCC`)**: Tend to have negative property values (e.g., `CC` = -0.860, `CCCCCC` = -0.918). Longer chains or aliphatic structures generally have more negative values.
2. **Polar/functionalized aliphatics (e.g., `C=O`, `OCC`)**: Can increase the property value (e.g., `CCOC` = 0.445, `CCCOC` = 0.445). The ester group (`C(=O)OCC`) is polar and may offset the negative contribution of the long hydrocarbon chain.
3. **Aromatic systems**: Often have positive values, but this molecule is purely aliphatic.

### Prediction:
The long hydrocarbon chain (`CCCCCCCCC`) would strongly favor a negative value, but the polar ester group (`C(=O)OCC`) would partially counteract this. Comparing to similar molecules:
- `CCCCCCc1ccccc1` (hexylbenzene) has a value of 0.146, where the aromatic ring gives a positive contribution.
- `CCCC=C(CC)C=O` (an aliphatic ketone) has a value of 0.105.
- `CCCCCC` (hexane) has a value of -0.919.

This molecule is closer to `CCCC=C(CC)C=O` but with a longer chain and an ester instead of a ketone. The ester is less polar than a ketone alone, and the chain is longer, so the value should be slightly lower than 0.105 but not as negative as pure alkanes.

### Estimated property value:
**0.05** (slightly positive due to the ester, but close to neutral due to the long hydrocarbon chain). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. The actual property might be something like logP, solubility, or a similar physicochemical parameter.)

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.46423762934188806
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol group (Oc1ccc...)**: Present in many molecules in the dataset. Examples:
   - **Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1**: -0.08864293
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**: 0.19208436
   - Phenol groups often contribute moderately negative to slightly positive values, depending on other substituents.

2. **Chlorine substituents (Cl)**: Present in many molecules. Examples:
   - **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: 0.69640948
   - **Cl\C=C/Cl**: 0.91699357
   - Chlorine often increases the property value, especially when paired with electron-withdrawing groups.

3. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: Present in some molecules. Examples:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1**: -0.44879158
   - **C(=O)N** is somewhat polar but can vary based on context.

4. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Strong electron-withdrawing group. Examples:
   - **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: 0.69640948
   - Nitro groups tend to increase the property value significantly.

5. **Aromatic systems with multiple substitutions**: The molecule has two aromatic rings with multiple substitutions (Cl, NO2, OH, amide), which can lead to additive or synergistic effects.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (0.69640948): This has a chloro and nitro group on a benzene ring, similar to one of the rings in our target molecule.
- **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** (0.19208436): This has phenol and chloro groups but lacks the nitro and amide, which likely explains its lower value.
- **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (-0.44879158): This has an amide but lacks strong electron-withdrawing groups like NO2 or Cl, leading to a negative value.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
- A phenol group (moderate effect),
- Two chloro substituents (positive effect),
- A nitro group (strong positive effect),
- An amide linkage (moderate effect),

the property value is likely to be **higher than 0.69640948** (from Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O) but not as extreme as 0.91699357 (from Cl\C=C/Cl, which is a simpler system). 

The additional amide and phenol groups may slightly temper the nitro group's effect, leading to a value in the range of **0.70 to 0.85**. 

### Final Prediction:
A reasonable estimate is **0.782**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the given data. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or computational tools would be necessary.)

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 0.8157928893720167
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as:

1. **Polarity/Functional Groups**: Molecules with polar groups (e.g., carbonyls, hydroxyls, halogens) tend to have higher (less negative) values, while nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., alkanes like C8H18) have very negative values.
2. **Aromaticity**: Aromatic rings often contribute positively to the property, especially when combined with polar substituents (e.g., Cl, O, N).
3. **Halogens (Cl, Br, F)**: Chlorine substituents, especially on aromatic rings, often increase the property value (e.g., Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1 = 0.317, Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl = 0.273).
4. **Sulfur/Phosphorus**: Sulfur (e.g., in thioethers like CCSSCC = 0.917) and phosphorus (e.g., in COP(=S)(OC)SCC... = 0.410) tend to increase the property value, especially in polar environments.
5. **Size/Branching**: Larger, more complex molecules with multiple functional groups or fused rings often have higher values.

### Target Molecule Analysis:
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**  
- Contains **two phosphate groups (P(=S)(OC)OC)**, which are polar and likely increase the property (similar to COP(=S)(OC)SCC... = 0.410).  
- Has **two aromatic rings linked by a thioether (S)**, which is polarizable (cf. CCSSCC = 0.917).  
- The **Oc1ccc...cc1** (phenoxy) groups add polarity.  
- Overall, the molecule is large, polar, and rich in heteroatoms (P, S, O), which should **strongly increase the property value**.

### Prediction:
Given the high polarity, aromaticity, and presence of P/S/O, the value should be **higher than most examples**, likely in the range of **0.5–0.9**.  

Comparing to similar molecules:  
- COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N... = 0.410 (less aromatic, fewer polar groups).  
- CCSSCC = 0.917 (simpler but highly polarizable S-S).  
- Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl = 0.769 (highly chlorinated aromatics).  

The target molecule combines features of these high-value examples but is more complex.  

**Predicted Property Value: 0.78**  
(Confidence: High, due to strong contributions from P/S/O and aromaticity.)

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.5147729845309149
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: Property = **0.52098862** (moderately positive)
   - **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2**: Property = **-0.26416348** (slightly negative, but this also has chlorines and an ether linkage)
   - Nitro groups often contribute to positive property values unless counterbalanced by other features.

2. **Presence of Hydroxyl Group (OH)**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O**: Property = **0.07848272** (slightly positive)
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = **-0.24248712** (negative, but heavily chlorinated)
   - Hydroxyl groups alone don't strongly push the property negative unless combined with other electronegative groups.

3. **Combination of OH and NO2 on an Aromatic Ring**:
   - The molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** has both an OH and a NO2 group on a benzene ring. This is somewhat similar to **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (property = 0.078) but with a NO2 instead of an amide. The NO2 is more electron-withdrawing than the amide, but the OH can donate electrons, balancing the effect.

4. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic systems with substituents like NO2 or OH tend to have property values around **0 to 0.5** unless other strongly negative features (e.g., multiple halogens, carbonyls) are present.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (a nitrophenol) likely has a property value in the **low positive range**, similar to **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (0.520)** but slightly less positive due to the OH group. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 0.25** (approximate, likely between 0.2 and 0.4 based on the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data. The actual property could be something like logP, solubility, or a bioactivity parameter, but the reasoning holds for many such properties.)

True Property: 0.8996140971199373
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, molecular weight, and aromaticity. The molecule in question is a complex carbohydrate (specifically, a branched oligosaccharide or polysaccharide-like structure) with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and ether linkages (C-O-C). 

Key observations from the examples:
1. Molecules with many polar groups (e.g., hydroxyls, amines) tend to have intermediate property values (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has a value of `0.6661397`).
2. Highly hydrophobic molecules (e.g., long alkanes like `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`) have values around `0.30582714`, while smaller alkanes or alkenes are more negative.
3. Aromatic systems with halogens or other substituents can vary widely but often have positive values (e.g., `Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1` has `0.90440484`).
4. The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups (as in sugars) tends to give intermediate to high positive values.

The given molecule (`OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O`) is a highly polar, branched sugar with many hydroxyl groups and ether linkages. Its size and polarity are comparable to some of the larger, more polar examples. 

Given the trend, I predict its property value to be in the range of **`0.6 to 0.8`**, leaning toward the higher end due to the extensive hydrogen bonding capacity and polarity. 

**Predicted property value: `0.725`** (approximate, based on the examples).

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.26270348439325075
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne) and compare it to the examples to predict its property value.

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Aliphatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO**, **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO**) tend to have positive property values (e.g., 0.83742011, 0.84856223), likely due to their nonpolar, hydrophobic nature.
2. **Polar or electronegative groups** (e.g., **-NO2**, **-Cl**, **-OH**, **-C=O**, **-N**) can significantly lower the property value (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has 0.74848297, but **Nc1cccc(Cl)c1** has -0.36634025).
3. **Unsaturation (double/triple bonds)** can influence the property:
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonpolar alkene) has a high value (0.81325683).
   - **CCC#C** (nonpolar alkyne) is structurally similar but with a triple bond.

### Analysis of **CCC#C**:
- It is a small, linear alkyne with no polar functional groups.
- It is nonpolar and hydrophobic, similar to aliphatic hydrocarbons like **CCCCCCCCC=C** (property = 0.81325683) but shorter in chain length.
- The triple bond may slightly reduce the property value compared to a pure alkane or alkene due to increased electron density, but the effect is likely small.

### Predicted property value:
Given the trends, **CCC#C** should have a moderately high positive value, but slightly lower than longer aliphatic chains or alkenes. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.65**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples, as the exact property being predicted is unspecified. If more context were provided, the prediction could be refined.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 0.7011079469560476
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: This functional group appears in some of the provided examples, often associated with moderately positive property values (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a value of **0.41039509**).
2. **Aromatic Ring with Chlorine Substituents (c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl)**: Chlorinated aromatic rings are present in many examples, and their property values vary depending on other substituents. For instance:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a value of **-0.86616937** (highly negative).
   - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl** has a value of **0.27327516** (positive).
   The presence of multiple chlorines tends to push the value toward the negative side unless balanced by other polar or functional groups.
3. **Ethoxy Group (CCO)**: This is a moderately polar group but not strongly influential on its own.
4. **Overall Polarity and Size**: The molecule is moderately large and polar due to the P(=S) and Cl substituents.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The molecule **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = **0.41039509**) shares the P(=S) group and chlorinated aromatic ring but has additional polar amide/carbonyl groups, which may increase its value.
- The molecule **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl** (property = **0.27327516**) is simpler but has a similar chlorinated aromatic motif.
- The molecule **Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (property = **-0.26416348**) has a nitro group, which is more electron-withdrawing than P(=S), but the P(=S) in our target molecule may offset this.

### Prediction:
Given the phosphorothioate group's moderate positive contribution and the chlorinated aromatic ring's tendency toward slightly negative or neutral values, the property value is likely in the low-to-moderate positive range. 

**Predicted property value: 0.35** (approximate, based on structural similarity to examples with values around 0.2–0.4). 

This balances the P(=S) group's positive influence with the chlorinated ring's slight negative effect.

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.07917412998370879
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - Molecules with **electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, Br, NO₂, carbonyls)** often have lower (more negative) property values.  
     - Example: `Nc1ccccc1Cl` (-0.344), `ClCC(C)C` (-0.922), `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (+0.891, but note the amide and aromatic Cl mix).  
   - Molecules with **electron-donating groups (e.g., alkyl, OMe, NH₂)** tend to have higher (more positive) values.  
     - Example: `CC1=CCCCC1` (+0.845), `Cc1ccc(O)cc1C` (+0.655).  
   - **Aromatic systems** with extended conjugation or fused rings often have moderate to high values unless paired with strong electron-withdrawing groups.  
     - Example: `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` (+0.832), `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` (-0.518).  

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - Molecules with **hydrogen bond donors (e.g., NH, OH)** or acceptors (e.g., C=O, NO₂) can shift values significantly.  
     - Example: `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` (+0.652, H-bonding and aromaticity).  
   - **Amides (C(=O)N)** often have mixed effects depending on context (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` is +0.891).  

3. **Specific Features in the Target Molecule**:
   - **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1** contains:  
     - A **pyridine ring (c1nccc)** (moderate electron-withdrawing due to N).  
     - A **hydrazide group (C(=O)NN)** (strong H-bond donor/acceptor, polar).  
     - No strong electron-withdrawing halogens or nitro groups.  

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` (+0.652): Similar H-bonding and aromatic N-heterocycle.  
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (+0.891): Amide with aromatic system (but with Cl, which complicates).  
- `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (-0.356): Aromatic with NH₂ (but no carbonyl).  

The **hydrazide group (C(=O)NN)** is highly polar and likely dominates, pushing the value toward the positive side. The pyridine N is less impactful than the hydrazide.  

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of moderate aromaticity (pyridine) and strong polarity (hydrazide), the predicted value is **~0.55**.  

### Final Answer:
**0.55** (rounded to two decimal places based on the trend).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends.)*

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 0.9142693470923778
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: This is a polar and moderately bulky group. In the examples, molecules with similar polar/charged groups (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** with a value of **-0.44166621**) tend to have mid-range negative or positive values depending on the rest of the structure.
2. **Thioether Linkage (SCC(=O))**: The sulfur atom and adjacent carbonyl group add polarity. Sulfur-containing molecules in the examples (e.g., **CCS** with **0.91762678** and **CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1** with **-0.69854518**) show variability, but the presence of additional polar groups here suggests a moderate influence.
3. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: This is highly polar and often associated with negative or mid-range values (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** with **-0.91808033**).
4. **Alkyl Chains (CCCC, OCCC)**: These are non-polar and may slightly offset the polarity of other groups.
5. **Cyclohexane Ring (N1CCCCC1)**: Saturated rings with polar substitutions (like the amide here) often contribute to mid-range values.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The molecule **CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1** (with a thioether and polar groups) has a value of **-0.69854518**.
- The molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** (with a phosphorothioate) has a value of **-0.44166621**.
- The molecule **CCOC(=O)N** (with an ester and amide) has a value of **0.90429306**.

Given the combination of the phosphorothioate, thioether, and amide groups, the property value is likely to be in the mid-range, leaning slightly negative due to the polar but not extremely polar nature of the groups. The alkyl chains may slightly reduce the polarity.

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **-0.45**, balancing the contributions of the polar and non-polar regions.

**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value for **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C** is **-0.45**.

Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.9279559944276521
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size. The molecule in question is **CCCCCCCC** (octane), a simple linear alkane with no functional groups or aromatic rings.

From the examples:
- **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol) has a property value of **-0.02778797**. This molecule has a polar hydroxyl group, which likely contributes to its slightly negative value.
- **CCC(C)CCO** (branched alcohol) has a value of **-0.92921127**, but this is likely due to branching and the alcohol group.
- **CCCCCC** (hexane) isn't in the examples, but simpler alkanes like **CC(C)C** (isobutane) or **CCCC** (butane) aren't listed either. However, **CC34CC1(F)C...** (a complex steroid-like molecule) has a value of **-0.91985529**, but this is not directly comparable.

For **CCCCCCCC** (octane):
- It is nonpolar, lacks functional groups, and is larger than some of the simpler alkanes in the dataset. Based on the trend that nonpolar, saturated hydrocarbons tend to have moderately negative values (e.g., **C/C1CCCCC1\C** with **-0.87133776** for cyclohexane), we can infer that octane would have a similar or slightly more negative value due to its longer chain.

**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCC: -0.89**  
*(This is an estimate based on the trend that larger, nonpolar alkanes tend toward more negative values in the given dataset.)*

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 0.8170066324465411
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, aromaticity, functional groups, and overall molecular complexity. The molecule in question is:

**CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**

### Key observations about this molecule:
1. **Steroid-like structure**: The molecule has a fused polycyclic (steroid-like) backbone, similar to some of the examples (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O`, which has a property value of **0.46385478**).
2. **Functional groups**: It contains a ketone (`C=O`) and two hydroxyl groups (`-OH`), which introduce polarity. The presence of a terminal alkyne (`C#C`) may also influence the property.
3. **Comparison to similar molecules**:
   - `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` (property = **0.46385478**) has a similar steroid backbone with one ketone and one hydroxyl group.
   - `CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO` (property = **-0.36021171**) has more polar groups (two hydroxyls, one ketone, and a fluorinated group).
   - The molecule in question has two hydroxyls and one ketone, but also a non-polar alkyne.

### Prediction:
The additional hydroxyl group (compared to the first similar example) would likely increase polarity, but the alkyne may offset this slightly. Given the examples, the property value is likely in the range of **0.3 to 0.5**. 

A reasonable estimate would be close to the first similar example but adjusted for the extra hydroxyl group and alkyne. 

**Predicted property value: 0.42** (rounded to two decimal places). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the provided data.)

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.6561722856351911
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as aromaticity, halogenation (especially chlorine), hydrogen bonding (e.g., hydroxyl groups, amines), and overall polarity. The property tends to be more negative for highly aromatic, halogenated, or hydrogen-bonding molecules, while simpler aliphatic or less polar molecules tend to have positive values.

Let's analyze the target molecule:  
**COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67**

### Key features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: Multiple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene and fused rings) contribute to negative values in the examples (e.g., polyaromatics like `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54` have highly negative values).
2. **Oxygen-containing functional groups**:  
   - Ethers (`OC`, `OCO`), esters (`COC=O`), and hydroxyl groups (`OH`) are present. These can contribute to negative values (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` has -0.565).  
   - However, some methoxy groups (`OMe`) can reduce negativity (e.g., `COc1ccccc1Cl` has +0.766).  
3. **Fused ring systems**: The molecule has complex fused rings, similar to some highly negative examples (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45` has -0.862).  
4. **Lack of halogens**: No chlorine/fluorine/bromine, which often drive values more negative.  
5. **Mixed polarity**: The molecule has both polar (OH, OCO) and nonpolar (aromatic, aliphatic) regions.  

### Comparison to examples:
- The closest analogs are polyaromatic systems with oxygen substituents (e.g., `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54` at -0.853 or `Oc1ccccc1Cl` at -0.565).  
- The presence of multiple ethers and hydroxyls suggests moderate negativity, but the lack of halogens and some aliphatic flexibility may offset this.  

### Predicted property value:
Given the balance of features, I predict a **moderately negative value**, likely between **-0.70 and -0.90**.  

**Final prediction: -0.82** (closer to the polyaromatic systems with oxygen substituents).

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.5651241180390203
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol): -0.49513808
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (another nitrophenol): -0.51477298
   - Phenol derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂) tend to have negative property values (~ -0.5).

2. **Chlorinated Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene): -0.53411762
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl): -0.11526876
   - Chlorine substituents on aromatics often reduce the property value, but the effect depends on the number and position of Cl atoms.

3. **Hydroxy and Chloro Combined**:
   - The molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** has both an OH (electron-donating) and a Cl (electron-withdrawing) group. The OH group is more strongly electron-donating, but the Cl reduces the property value compared to plain phenol.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Fc1ccccc1** (fluorobenzene): -0.29197618 (halogen alone gives a moderately negative value).
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: -0.495 (NO₂ is strongly electron-withdrawing, similar to Cl but more extreme).
   - **Clc1ccccc1I**: -0.534 (two halogens, more negative than one).

### Prediction:
For **Oc1ccccc1Cl**, the OH group would raise the property value slightly compared to pure chlorobenzene, but the Cl would pull it down compared to phenol. Given that:
- Phenol (no substituent) would likely be less negative than nitrophenol (-0.495).
- Adding Cl (less electron-withdrawing than NO₂) would result in a value less negative than nitrophenol but more negative than fluorobenzene (-0.292).

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.4 and -0.5**. Averaging the trends, I predict:  
**-0.45** (closer to nitrophenol due to the polar Cl-OH interaction).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is **-0.45**.

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -0.9192949218802875
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Alkyne (C#C)**: Rare in the examples, but similar to double bonds (e.g., CC(C)C=C has 0.47085559).
   - **Chlorine substituents (Cl)**: Present in multiple positions. Chlorinated aromatics (e.g., Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has 0.69995341, while Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has -0.93162379). The effect depends on the context.
   - **Amide (N-C=O)**: Present in molecules like CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1 (0.91033342) and others with values ranging from positive to negative.
   - **Ether (O-C)**: Present in molecules like COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC (-0.89342714) or CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1 (-0.15855562).
   - **Aromatic ring with Cl**: Similar to Clc1cccc(Cl)c1, which is part of larger structures with varying values.

2. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is moderately polar (due to Cl, amide, and ether) and of intermediate size. This suggests a value between -1 and 1, likely closer to 0.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O** (0.00323776): Highly chlorinated/fluorinated with amide, similar to our molecule but more complex. Our molecule might have a slightly higher value due to fewer halogens.
   - **CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1** (-0.15855562): Ether + amide + aromatic, similar but without halogens. Our molecule's chlorines may lower the value slightly.
   - **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (-0.93162379): Highly chlorinated aromatic, but our molecule has additional polar groups (amide, alkyne) that could raise the value.

### Prediction:
Given the mix of polar groups (amide, ether) and chlorines, the value is likely **negative but not extreme**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.45** (similar to molecules like CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1 but adjusted for the alkyne and additional Cl).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: -0.45** (approximate, based on structural similarity to given examples).

Iteration: 88
SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 0.42829136093765746
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Central oxygen (O) attached to a carbon with three substituents**: 
   - A phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent: **c1ccc(Cl)cc1**
   - A pyrimidine-like ring (heterocycle with N atoms): **c2cncnc2**
   - Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent: **c3ccccc3Cl**

2. **Presence of aromatic rings (phenyl and pyrimidine-like)** with **chlorine substituents**, which can influence polarity and electronic effects.

3. **Mixed functional groups**: The oxygen is likely part of an alcohol or ether (though the exact bonding isn't specified), and the presence of nitrogen in the heterocycle adds polarity.

### Comparison to training examples:
- Molecules with **chlorinated phenyl rings** (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`, `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`) tend to have property values in the **0.3 to 0.6 range**, depending on other substituents.
- Molecules with **heterocycles containing nitrogen** (e.g., `Nc1nc[nH]n1`, `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2`) often have **positive property values (0.5 to 0.9)** due to increased polarity/hydrogen bonding.
- Bulky, multi-ring systems with **chlorine substituents** (e.g., `ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`, `Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc2Cl`) can have **negative values (-0.5 to -0.9)** if they are highly hydrophobic or sterically hindered.

### Prediction:
This molecule combines:
- A polar heterocycle (pyrimidine-like, likely increasing the property value).
- Two chlorinated phenyl rings (which can either increase or decrease the value depending on context).
- A central oxygen linker (could add polarity).

Given the balance of these features, the property value is likely **moderately positive**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

This is based on:
- The nitrogen heterocycle contributing a positive effect (~0.5–0.7).
- The chlorinated phenyl rings slightly offsetting this (pulling toward 0.3–0.5).
- No strongly negative features (e.g., long aliphatic chains or highly sterically hindered groups). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data.)

Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.8939044716521132
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Carbon Chain Length and Saturation**: 
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCBr` with 4 carbons: 0.898) tend to have higher property values, while shorter or unsaturated chains (e.g., `C=Cc1ccccc1`: -0.597) have lower values.
   - The presence of double bonds or rings often reduces the property value (e.g., `C1CCCCCCC1`: -0.837).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Esters (RCOOR')**: 
     - `CC(=O)OCC` (ethyl acetate): 0.664
     - `CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3...` (complex ester): 0.858
     - Esters generally have positive property values, especially with aliphatic chains.
   - **Aldehydes (R-CHO)**:
     - `CCCCCC=O` (hexanal): 0.296
     - `O=Cc1ccco1` (formylfuran): 0.391
     - Aldehydes tend to have moderate positive values.
   - **Ethers (R-O-R')**:
     - `CCOc1ccc(NC(N)=O)cc1`: -0.811 (but this also has an amide, which complicates things).
     - Ethers alone are not strongly represented, but they don't seem to drastically lower the value.

3. **Combination of Functional Groups**:
   - `CCCCOC=O` is an ester (formate group) with a butyl chain. Comparing to similar molecules:
     - `CC(=O)OCC` (ethyl acetate): 0.664 (shorter chain)
     - `CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3...` (longer chain ester): 0.858
     - `CCCCCC=O` (hexanal): 0.296 (aldehyde, not ester, but similar chain length)
   - The butyl chain (4 carbons) is longer than ethyl acetate but shorter than the complex ester example. The formate group (`OC=O`) is simpler than acetate (`OC(=O)C`), which might slightly reduce the value compared to ethyl acetate.

4. **Polarity and Electron-Withdrawing Effects**:
   - The formate group is polar but less bulky than acetate, which may not significantly alter the trend for aliphatic esters.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Ethyl acetate (2-carbon chain): 0.664
- Hexanal (6-carbon chain, aldehyde): 0.296
- Butyl formate (4-carbon chain, ester) should likely fall between these, closer to ethyl acetate because it's an ester (which tends to have higher values than aldehydes). 

A reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than ethyl acetate due to the shorter chain and simpler ester group. 

**Predicted property value for CCCCOC=O: ~0.55**

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at `CCCCCC=O` (hexanal, 0.296) and `CC(=O)OCC` (ethyl acetate, 0.664), butyl formate is intermediate in chain length but with an ester group. The ester group likely adds ~0.3 over the aldehyde, so:
- Hexanal (0.296) + ester effect (~0.3) ≈ 0.6, but adjusted for shorter chain (4 vs 6): ~0.55.

**Final predicted value: 0.55** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the examples).

**Answer:** The predicted property value for `CCCCOC=O` is **0.55**.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.8984584150733969
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Alkanes**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane): Property value = **-0.30639072**
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene): Property value = **0.53132701**
   - **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(NC=O)...** (a highly chlorinated complex molecule): Property value = **0.61486017**

   Chlorinated alkanes with fewer chlorines (e.g., ClCCCl) tend to have negative property values, while heavily chlorinated or aromatic chlorinated compounds (e.g., hexachlorobenzene) have positive values.

2. **Small Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - **ClCCCl** is a small, symmetric dichlorinated alkane with a value of **-0.30639072**.
   - **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) is even smaller and less polarizable than ClCCCl, so its property value should be slightly more negative.

3. **Other Small Molecules**:
   - **CNN** (a small polar molecule): Property value = **-0.82214039**
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane): Property value = **-0.27775557**
   - **CCCC** (butane): Property value = **0.40978461**

   Small, non-polar or weakly polar molecules (like ClCCl) tend to have negative or near-zero values, while larger/hydrophobic molecules (like CCCC) have positive values.

### Prediction for ClCCl:
- **ClCCl** is smaller and less polarizable than **ClCCCl**, so its property value should be more negative than **-0.30639072** but not as extreme as **CNN** (-0.82214039).
- It is also less polarizable than **CCBr** (-0.27775557), so its value should be more negative than that.

Given these trends, a reasonable estimate for **ClCCl** is:
**-0.35**

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **ClCCl** is **-0.35**.

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: 0.6719897545397142
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Hydroxyl (-OH) Groups**:
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol): Property = -0.79733911
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (methyl-substituted phenol): Property = -0.93072175
   - **c1ccccc1C(O)C(O)c2ccccc2** (diphenylmethanol-like): Property = -0.78580526
   - Phenolic or hydroxylated aromatics tend to have **negative property values**, often in the range of -0.7 to -0.9.

2. **Methyl Substitution on Aromatic Rings**:
   - Methyl groups on aromatic rings (e.g., **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O**) further decrease the property value (more negative).
   - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (methyl-substituted polyaromatic): Property = -0.7353656.

3. **Comparison to Target Molecule**:
   - The target molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (specifically, 2,5-dimethylphenol or similar).
   - It has:
     - A hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to an aromatic ring (like the examples above).
     - Two methyl groups (one at position 1 and one on the ring), which may further decrease the property value compared to simpler phenols.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (property = -0.93072175) and **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (property = -0.79733911), the presence of two methyl groups in **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** suggests a property value slightly more negative than catechol but comparable to other methyl-substituted phenols. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value = -0.85 to -0.92**.  

For specificity, we can take the average of similar structures:  
- Average of **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (-0.93072175) and **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (-0.79733911) ≈ **-0.864**.  
- Adjusting for the second methyl group (slightly more negative), we arrive at:  
**Predicted value = -0.89**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is **-0.89**.

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.769244538295572
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, I will predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Aromatic Systems**: 
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a property value of **0.02427528**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** has a property value of **-0.86616937**.
   - **Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl** has a property value of **-0.68589784**.

   These molecules share multiple chlorine substitutions on aromatic rings, and their property values tend to be low (near zero or negative). The presence of more chlorines generally correlates with more negative values.

2. **Biphenyl-like Structure**: 
   - The given molecule is a **chlorinated biphenyl** (two benzene rings linked directly, with multiple Cl substitutions). 
   - The example **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** is very similar (also a chlorinated biphenyl) and has a value of **-0.86616937**.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution Pattern**: 
   - The given molecule has chlorines at multiple positions on both rings, similar to the example with **-0.86616937**, but with slightly fewer chlorines (5 Cl atoms vs. 7 Cl atoms in the example). Fewer chlorines might slightly increase the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (value = **-0.86616937**) but with fewer chlorines, I predict the property value for **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** to be **slightly higher** (less negative) but still in the same general range. 

### Final Predicted Value:
**-0.65** (approximate, based on interpolation between the examples). 

This is consistent with the trend that fewer chlorines lead to less negative values while retaining the overall chlorinated aromatic character.

Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.5675585566227802
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains/Alkanes**: 
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane) has a property value of **-0.92795599**, indicating that saturated hydrocarbons tend to have highly negative values.
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane) has a value of **-0.92705318**, similar to octane.

2. **Alkenes (C=C)**:
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (1-nonene) has a value of **0.81325683**, suggesting that the presence of a double bond in a hydrocarbon chain increases the property value significantly compared to saturated analogs.
   - **COC(=O)C=C** (methyl acrylate) has a value of **0.76444921**, further supporting that C=C bonds contribute to higher values.

3. **Branched Alkenes**:
   - **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene) is a branched alkene with two methyl groups attached to the double bond. Based on the examples, branching alone (as in **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**) does not significantly change the value compared to linear chains, but the presence of a double bond (as in **CCCCCCCCC=C**) increases the value.

4. **Other Factors**:
   - Aromatic rings, polar groups, and heteroatoms introduce additional variability, but for pure hydrocarbons, the key factor seems to be unsaturation (double bonds).

### Prediction for **CC=C(C)C**:
- The molecule is a branched alkene, similar to **CCCCCCCCC=C** but with more branching. 
- Branching might slightly reduce the value compared to a linear alkene, but the double bond should still dominate, leading to a positive value.
- Given that **CCCCCCCCC=C** has a value of **0.81325683**, and **CC=C(C)C** is smaller and more branched, I would expect a slightly lower but still positive value.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **CC=C(C)C** is:  
**0.65** (approximate, likely between 0.6 and 0.8 based on the examples).  

However, looking more closely, **CCCCCCCCC=C** (linear) is 0.813, and **CC=C(C)C** is smaller and branched, so a slightly lower value is plausible. A more precise estimate might be:  
**0.70** (balancing the double bond effect and branching).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CC=C(C)C: 0.70** (approximate, based on trends in the data).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The value is likely positive due to the double bond but slightly reduced by branching.)*

Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.8984584150733969
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The molecule in question is **ClCCl** (dichloromethane, CH2Cl2). 

### Observations from the dataset:
1. **Chlorinated compounds**: 
   - **Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobenzene derivative) has a property value of **0.20865813**.
   - **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (tetrachloroethylene) has a property value of **-0.81813861**.
   - **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl** (a polychlorinated hydrocarbon) has a property value of **-0.93052975**.
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (dichlorophenol) has a property value of **0.89785159**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (trichlorobenzene derivative) has a property value of **-0.58352737**.

2. **Small chlorinated alkanes**:
   - **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (tetrachloroethylene) has **-0.81813861**.
   - **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) is simpler and less chlorinated than many examples, but its property value likely falls in the negative range based on similar small chlorinated compounds.

3. **General trend**:
   - Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive or near-zero values.
   - Small chlorinated aliphatic compounds (like CCl4 analogs) tend to have negative values.
   - **Dichloromethane (ClCCl)** is a small, aliphatic, di-chlorinated molecule, so its value is likely negative but less extreme than heavily chlorinated compounds like CCl4 analogs.

### Prediction:
Given the simplicity of **ClCCl** and the trends observed for small chlorinated alkanes, a reasonable estimate for its property value is:

**Predicted property value: -0.65**  

This is based on:
- It is less chlorinated than **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (-0.818) but more chlorinated than non-chlorinated alkanes (which tend to have values closer to zero or positive).
- It lacks aromaticity or complex functional groups that would push the value toward the positive range.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.2649396322297237
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - The molecule **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (which is very similar to the target molecule) has a property value of **-0.24248712**.
   - Another chlorinated aromatic, **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1**, has a high value (**0.90440484**), but bromine substitution may behave differently from chlorine.
   - The molecule **O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23** (which has chlorine indirectly via substitution patterns) has a value of **0.82242557**, but this is more complex.

2. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(O)cc1** has a value of **0.83015518**, but it includes an amide group.
   - **Oc1ccc(CC=C)cc1** has a value of **-0.33384771**, but lacks chlorine.

3. **Chlorine Substitution**:
   - Chlorine substitution in aliphatic chains (e.g., **ClCC**) gives a high value (**0.75458642**), but this is not directly comparable to aromatic chlorination.
   - The molecule **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (very similar to the target) has a value of **-0.24248712**, suggesting that multiple chlorines on a phenol ring may lead to slightly negative values.

4. **Target Molecule**: **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**
   - This is a trichlorophenol (2,3,6-trichlorophenol, based on the SMILES notation).
   - It is structurally very similar to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (which has a value of **-0.24248712**), but with a slightly different substitution pattern (2,3,6 vs. 2,4,6).
   - The additional chlorine in the target molecule may further decrease the property value slightly compared to the dichloro example.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (-0.24248712) and the additional chlorine in the target molecule, the property value is likely slightly more negative. 

**Predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl: -0.30** (approximate, based on the trend). 

For a more precise estimate, I would align it closely with the given dichloro example and adjust slightly downward due to the extra chlorine. Thus, a reasonable prediction is:

**-0.28** (refined estimate). 

However, since the given dichloro example is -0.242, and the trichloro version would likely be more negative but not drastically so, I would predict:

**Final predicted value: -0.27** (conservative adjustment from the dichloro case). 

But given the data, the closest match is the dichloro example, so the prediction is likely in the range of **-0.25 to -0.30**. 

**Final answer: -0.27**. 

(Note: Without a clear quantitative trend, this is an educated guess based on structural similarity.)

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.6561722856351911
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to predict the property value.

### Structural Analysis of the Molecule:
The molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple functional groups:
1. **Aromatic rings with methoxy (-OCH₃) and hydroxyl (-OH) substituents**: These are present in the examples with mixed contributions (e.g., `Cc1cc(C)c(O)c(C)c1` has a positive value, while `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a negative value).
2. **Sugar-like moieties (tetrahydrofuran and pyran rings with multiple -OH groups)**: These are seen in examples like `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (value = -0.6166), suggesting a negative contribution.
3. **Lactone (cyclic ester) group (COC2=O)**: This is similar to carbonyl groups in other examples, which can have varying effects.
4. **Fused polycyclic system**: Larger fused systems like `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5cccc6c(c1)c2c3c4c56` have positive values (0.8417), but this is balanced by polar groups.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The presence of multiple polar groups (e.g., -OH, -OCH₃) and sugar-like rings tends to lower the property value (as seen in the carbohydrate example with -0.6166).
- The aromatic rings with electron-donating groups (methoxy, hydroxyl) may slightly increase the value, but the overall effect is likely dominated by the polar aliphatic regions.
- The size and complexity of the molecule suggest a value closer to mid-range negatives (similar to steroids or large polar molecules in the examples).

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the balance of these features, the predicted property value is:  
**-0.3723**  

This aligns with the trend observed for large, polar, polyfunctional molecules in the provided examples.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.9314731866120622
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** with a **thiomethyl (CS)** group attached. The ring also has **amide-like (C=O)** and **amino (N)** substituents, along with a bulky **tert-butyl (C(C)(C)C)** group.
2. **Polarity**: The presence of **C=O**, **N**, and **S** suggests moderate polarity, but the bulky tert-butyl group may reduce overall polarity.
3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Similar to **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property = **0.89336794**), which also has a heterocycle with C=O, N, and a tert-butyl group.
   - Also resembles **Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1** (property = **-0.81893114**), but the tert-butyl group and sulfur substitution likely increase the property value.

### Key Observations:
- Bulky alkyl groups (e.g., tert-butyl) tend to **increase** the property value (see examples like **CC(C)CCCO** = **0.39706402** vs. smaller alkyls).
- Sulfur-containing heterocycles (e.g., **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** = **0.91763094**) often have higher values.
- The **C=O and N** in the ring suggest some polarity, but the tert-butyl group dominates steric/electronic effects.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (0.89336794) but with a simpler ring system, the property is likely slightly lower but still **positive and close to 0.8–0.9**.

**Final Prediction**: **0.847** (rounded to 3 decimal places).  

### Rationale:
- The tert-butyl group and sulfur substitution push the value higher (as seen in other examples).
- The absence of additional polar groups (e.g., OH) prevents it from reaching >0.9.  
- The value is consistent with the trend for bulky, heterocyclic molecules in the dataset.  

Thus, the predicted property for **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C** is **0.847**.

Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.18773604058132815
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:**  
`CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1`  
This is ethyl benzoate, which consists of:  
- An aromatic benzene ring (`c1ccccc1`)  
- An ester functional group (`COC=O`) attached to the benzene ring  
- An ethyl group (`CCO`) as part of the ester  

### Observations from the training data:  
1. **Aromatic rings with polar substituents** tend to have moderate property values (e.g., `o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` = 0.180, `Nc1ccccc1` = -0.626).  
2. **Esters (COO)** often have positive but not extreme values (e.g., `CCCC(=O)OCC` = 0.199, `COCC(=O)N(...)` = 0.430).  
3. **Benzene rings with electron-withdrawing groups** (like esters) tend to have values in the range of **0.1 to 0.5**.  

### Comparison to similar molecules:  
- `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (diphenyl ether) = -0.142  
- `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (a benzofuranone) = -0.701  
- `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl butyrate) = 0.198  

Ethyl benzoate is more polar than diphenyl ether but less polar than some highly substituted esters. Given the ester group's contribution and the aromatic ring, a reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than `CCCC(=O)OCC` (0.198) but lower than `COCC(=O)N(...)` (0.430).  

### Predicted property value:  
**0.25** (approximate, based on trends in the data).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The true property could be logP, solubility, or another descriptor, but the trend suggests this value fits the pattern.)*  

---  
**Final answer:** **0.25** (estimated).

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.9034726018696673
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkyl Halides (e.g., CI, Cl-containing molecules):**
   - **CI** has a property value of **-0.78280876**.
   - Other Cl-containing molecules (e.g., **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**) tend to have negative values unless combined with strongly positive-influencing groups (e.g., nitro groups or carbonyls).

2. **Alkyl Chains:**
   - Longer alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCO**) have values close to zero (**-0.02778797**).
   - Branched alkanes or alkenes (e.g., **CC(=C)C(=C)C**) have slightly positive values (**0.25474628**).

3. **Bromine-Specific Examples:**
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a value of **0.1205577**, suggesting that Br alone does not strongly push the value negative unless combined with other features.

4. **Functional Groups:**
   - Carbonyls (C=O) and nitro groups (NO2) tend to increase the property value.
   - Hydroxyl (OH) and amines (NH2) tend to decrease the value.

### Analysis of **CCCCCCCBr**:
- This is a linear alkyl bromide (1-bromoheptane) with no other functional groups.
- The Br substituent is similar to Cl in terms of electronegativity but less polarizable. From the examples, Br alone does not strongly decrease the value (e.g., **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is slightly positive).
- The long alkyl chain (**CCCCCC**) will have a neutral-to-slightly-negative effect (similar to **CCCCCCCO**, which is **-0.02778797**).

### Prediction:
Given the combination of a long alkyl chain (neutral/slightly negative) and a Br substituent (slightly negative but less so than Cl), the value should be slightly negative but closer to zero than **CI** (-0.782). 

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.2 and -0.4**. Averaging the trends, I predict:  
**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr: -0.25**.

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at **CCCCCCCO** (-0.027) and **CI** (-0.782), replacing the OH in **CCCCCCCO** with Br (less polar than OH but more than H) would likely shift the value slightly more negative than **CCCCCCCO** but less than **CI**. Thus, **-0.25** is a plausible midpoint.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr: -0.25**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. If the property is logP or similar, Br would increase hydrophobicity slightly, supporting this range.)
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 0.3181021493065627
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule **CO** (formaldehyde) in this context.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Small, polar molecules** (e.g., **CCCCOC=O** with -0.89390447, **NC(=O)N** with -0.80850044) tend to have negative property values.
2. **Hydrocarbons or non-polar molecules** (e.g., **CC1=CCCCC1** with 0.84566012, **CCC(C)(C)CC** with 0.91318963) tend to have positive property values.
3. **Formaldehyde (CO)** is a small, highly polar molecule due to the carbonyl group (C=O), similar to other polar molecules in the dataset with negative values.

### Prediction:
Since **CO** is a small, polar molecule like **CCCCOC=O** (which has a value of -0.89390447) or **NC(=O)N** (-0.80850044), it is likely to have a negative property value. Given its simplicity (just one polar C=O bond), the value should be moderately negative but not as extreme as larger polar molecules.

### Estimated Property Value for **CO**:
**-0.75** (approximate, based on the trend of small polar molecules in the dataset). 

This is a rough estimate, as the exact property is not explicitly defined, but the trend suggests polarity and size are key factors.
