SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.36534916138315576
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can analyze the given molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** and predict its property value by comparing it to structurally or functionally similar molecules in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Long Hydrocarbon Chain with Ester Group**:  
   The molecule has a long hydrocarbon chain (**CCCCCCCCC**) and an ester group (**CC(=O)OC**). This is similar to:  
   - **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (given in the examples) with a property value of **0.36534916**.  
   - **CCOC(=O)CC** (ethyl acetate derivative) with a value of **0.36534916**.  
   - **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (another ester) with a value of **0.36534916**.  

   These esters with moderate-length hydrocarbon chains consistently have values around **0.36**.

2. **Effect of Chain Length**:  
   The property doesn't seem to change drastically with longer hydrocarbon chains (e.g., **CCCCCC(C)O** and **CCCCCCC(C)O** both have **0.82437759**). However, the presence of the ester group seems to dominate over pure hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCCCC** has **0.8618493**, but adding **C(=O)OC** reduces the value).

3. **No Strong Electron-Withdrawing or Donating Groups**:  
   Unlike molecules with nitro (**NO2**), amines (**NH2**), or halogens (e.g., **Cl**, **Br**), this molecule lacks strongly polar or charged groups, so its value is likely in the moderate range (not highly positive or negative).

### Conclusion:  
Given the structural similarity to other esters in the dataset (particularly **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**, which is identical except for a slightly shorter chain), the predicted property value for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is:  

**Predicted Property Value: 0.36534916**  

This matches the trend observed for esters with hydrocarbon tails in the provided examples.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.2810378164485809
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **benzofuran-2-one-like** structure (a benzene fused to a lactam/lactone-like ring with a carbonyl group and NH). This is somewhat similar to the structure **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property = 0.77753796), which also has a cyclic carbonyl and heteroatoms (S instead of O here). 
2. **Substituents**: It has a **chlorine atom** attached to the benzene ring. Chlorine substituents often correlate with property values around **0.487** (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** and **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**). However, the presence of the **lactam-like** ring (with NH and C=O) may modulate this.
3. **Electron-Withdrawing Effects**: The **carbonyl (C=O)** and **NH** in the fused ring introduce polarity and hydrogen-bonding potential, which may lower the property value slightly compared to simple chlorinated aromatics.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (cyclic thiourea-like) has a property of **0.77753796**.
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (polychlorinated biphenyl-like) has a property of **0.48713222**.
- The given molecule is intermediate in complexity between these two, with both a chlorinated aromatic ring and a polar heterocycle.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the chlorine's contribution (~0.487) and the polar heterocycle's contribution (~0.777), the property value is likely **between 0.5 and 0.8**. A reasonable estimate is **~0.6**. 

However, looking more closely at **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)** (property = -0.44029258), which has multiple carbonyls and NH groups, the value is much lower. Since our molecule has only one carbonyl and NH, the reduction won't be as drastic. 

Given the examples, the closest match is likely **0.77753796** (similar to the cyclic carbonyl structure in **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)**), but slightly reduced due to the chlorine. Thus, the predicted value is:

**Predicted property value: 0.7** (approximate; exact value likely between 0.6 and 0.8). 

However, reviewing the data again, the presence of chlorine in aromatic systems often gives ~0.487, while the heterocycle may push it higher. A compromise is **~0.6**. 

Given the uncertainty, the most plausible answer based on the examples is:

**Predicted property value: 0.77753796** (same as the cyclic carbonyl structure **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)**, as the chlorine's effect may be offset by the heterocycle's contribution). 

But if we consider that the chlorine's effect is dominant (as in many examples where Cl-aromatics give ~0.487), the value might be closer to **0.48713222**. 

Given the ambiguity, the safest bet is to average the two closest analogs:
- **Cl-aromatic**: 0.487
- **Cyclic C=O/NH**: 0.777  
Average: ~0.63

Thus, the final predicted value is:

**Predicted property value: 0.63** (approximate). 

However, since the examples often repeat specific values (e.g., 0.487, 0.777), and the structure is closer to **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** than to simple Cl-aromatics, the most precise prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 0.77753796**. 

But to be conservative, given the chlorine's presence, I'll adjust slightly downward:

**Final predicted property value: 0.7**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples.) 

---

**Final Answer: 0.7** (approximate; likely between 0.6 and 0.8). 

However, based on the closest structural analog (**C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** = 0.77753796), the prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 0.77753796**. 

But since the question asks for a "specific" value, and the examples repeat values like 0.487 and 0.777, the most precise match is:

**Predicted property value: 0.77753796**. 

(If this seems incorrect, the next closest is **0.48713222** for Cl-aromatics, but the heterocycle likely increases it.) 

Thus, the answer is **0.77753796**. 

---

**Final Answer: 0.77753796** (same as the cyclic carbonyl analog).

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.2997736708784867
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - The molecule **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** has a nitro group attached to a heterocyclic ring and a property value of **-0.47776429**.
   - Nitro groups generally introduce some polarity and electron-withdrawing effects, which may lower the property value compared to purely hydrocarbon structures.

2. **Hydrocarbon vs. Functionalized Molecules**:
   - Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCC(C)CC**) have positive values (~0.8618493).
   - Molecules with polar or electronegative atoms (e.g., Cl, O, N) tend to have lower or negative values.

3. **Structure of CC(C)N(=O)=O**:
   - This is a small nitroalkane (tert-butyl nitro or isopropyl nitro derivative). The nitro group is attached to a branched hydrocarbon (isopropyl group).
   - The presence of the nitro group will likely reduce the property value compared to a pure hydrocarbon like **CCC(C)CC**.

### Comparison:
- The nitro group's effect is somewhat similar to the nitro-substituted heterocycle in **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** (-0.47776429), but the isopropyl group is less polarizable than the heterocycle, so the value might be slightly less negative.
- The molecule is simpler than many of the examples, so the value should be closer to zero than highly conjugated or polycyclic systems.

### Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is approximately:  
**-0.35**  

(Note: This is an estimate based on the given examples and trends. The actual value may vary slightly depending on the specific property being predicted, such as logP, dipole moment, or another descriptor.)

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: -0.07494341771962174
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular complexity. The property values range from highly negative (e.g., -2.089 for highly conjugated or polyaromatic systems with polar groups) to highly positive (e.g., 1.480 for heavily halogenated aromatic systems).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**

This is a steroid-like structure with the following key features:
1. **Multiple rings (steroid backbone)**: Cyclic systems generally reduce the property value (e.g., see `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` with a value of 0.0).
2. **Polar functional groups**: 
   - Two carbonyl groups (`C=O`), one of which is part of an aldehyde (`C(=O)CO`).
   - One hydroxyl group (`C(O)`).
   These polar groups would typically lower the property value (similar to how alcohols and carbonyls reduce values in the examples).
3. **No halogens or aromatic rings**: The absence of halogens (which increase the property value) and aromaticity (which can decrease it in complex cases) suggests the value will not be extreme in either direction.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` (a steroid with two carbonyls) has a value of **0.0**.
- `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC` (a polar cyclic structure) has a value of **-0.440**.
- `CC(C)C(C)(C)C` (a nonpolar branched alkane) has a value of **0.862**.

The target molecule is more polar than `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` due to the additional hydroxyl and aldehyde groups, but it lacks the extreme features (e.g., halogens, polyaromaticity) that drive values to the extremes.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of polar groups and cyclic structure, the predicted value is likely slightly negative but close to zero. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.25**  

This aligns with the trend where polar, non-aromatic, non-halogenated cyclic structures have values in the mild negative range.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: -1.452028718317669
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). 
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a value of **0.67449076** (two chlorines on aromatic ring).
   - Example: **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** has a value of **-0.06557549** (fluorine substituents on aromatic ring).
   - Example: **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** has a value of **-0.08431134** (aromatic ring with chlorine and fused ring).

2. **Amide groups**: The molecule has two amide linkages (**C(=O)NC(=O)N**).
   - Example: **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** has a value of **-0.15925476** (thiourea-like group attached to aromatic ring).
   - Example: **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** has a value of **-0.43092465** (amide attached to aromatic ring).

3. **Halogen substituents**: The molecule has fluorine and chlorine atoms.
   - Fluorine substituents tend to lower the property slightly (e.g., **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is **-0.06557549**).
   - Chlorine substituents tend to increase the property (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** is **0.67449076**).

4. **Polar functional groups**: The amide groups are polar and may reduce the property value compared to purely hydrophobic or halogenated structures.

### Comparison and Prediction:
- The presence of two aromatic rings with halogens (F and Cl) suggests a moderate property value, but the amide linkages will likely reduce it further.
- The closest analog is **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (**-0.15925476**), but our molecule has more halogens (increasing the value) and additional amide groups (decreasing the value).
- The chlorine-substituted aromatic ring (**Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**) contributes **~0.674**, but the fluorines and amides will offset this.

### Predicted Property:
Considering the balance of halogens (increasing) and polar amides (decreasing), the predicted property value is approximately:  
**-0.25**  

(Note: This is an educated estimate based on structural trends in the given data. For precise predictions, computational or experimental methods would be needed.)

**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value for **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2** is approximately **-0.25**.

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 0.8243775949158385
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl propyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - Molecules with ether linkages tend to have moderate positive property values unless other strongly polar or bulky groups are present.
   - Example: **CCOC(=O)CC** (ethyl propanoate, not a pure ether but contains -O-) has a value of **0.36534916**.
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (a polyol with multiple -O- groups) has a value of **0.63701905**.

2. **Hydrocarbon Chains**:
   - Simple alkanes or alkyl groups (e.g., **CCCCCC**, **CC(C)C**) tend to have positive property values, often around **0.8–1.2**.
   - Example: **CCCCCC1CCCC1** (cyclohexylhexane) has a value of **0.8618493**.
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (branched alcohol) has a value of **0.82437759**.

3. **Branching Effects**:
   - Branched chains (e.g., **CC(C)C**, **CC(C)(C)C**) often have slightly higher values than linear chains, likely due to increased hydrophobicity.
   - Example: **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** has a value of **0.8618493**.

4. **Polar vs. Nonpolar Groups**:
   - Polar groups (e.g., -OH, -CN, halogens) can reduce the property value if they dominate the molecule.
   - Nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCCCO**) have values around **0.82437759**.

### Analysis of **CCCOC(C)C**:
- This is a simple ether with a propyl group (**CCC-**) and an isopropyl group (**-OC(C)C**).
- It lacks strongly polar or bulky substituents, so the property value should be similar to other nonpolar or weakly polar molecules with ethers or hydrocarbons.
- The closest analogs in the examples are:
  - **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol, value = **0.82437759**).
  - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (branched alcohol, value = **0.82437759**).
  - **CCOC(=O)CC** (ethyl propanoate, value = **0.36534916**, but this has an ester, which is more polar than an ether).

Given the dominance of hydrocarbon character and the ether linkage, the predicted value should be close to **0.8–0.9**, similar to other nonpolar/aliphatic examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.82437759** (same as **CCCCCO** and **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**, as the ether group's effect is offset by the hydrocarbon bulk). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCOC(C)C** is:  
**0.82437759**

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.07494341771962174
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **bromine (Br)** substituent, which is electronegative and often increases the property value (as seen in examples like `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` with a value of 0.674).
   - It has a **lactam-like structure** (cyclic amide with C=O and NH) and an additional carbonyl (C=O), which are polar and may decrease the property value (similar to `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` with -0.440).
   - The **alkyl group (CCC(C))** is nonpolar and may slightly increase the property value (e.g., `CCC(C)CC` has 0.862).

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **halogens (Cl/Br)** and **polar groups** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` with 0.215 or `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` with 0.084) tend to have moderate positive values.
   - Molecules with **cyclic amides/carbonyls** (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` with -0.440 or `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3` with -1.030) tend to have negative values.
   - The presence of **Br** here may offset some of the negative contribution from the polar groups.

3. **Hybrid Case**:
   - This molecule is a hybrid of **halogenated** and **polar cyclic amide/carbonyl** features. Examples like `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (0.084) or `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (0.674) suggest a slight positive value, while the cyclic amide may pull it toward zero or slightly negative.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the competing effects of the **Br (increasing)** and the **polar amide/carbonyl (decreasing)**, the property value is likely **close to zero but slightly negative**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.25** (interpolating between similar examples). 

However, looking at closer analogs like `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (0.084) and adjusting for the additional polar groups, a more precise prediction might be:  
**-0.15 to -0.30**. 

For specificity, I'll select:  
**-0.20**. 

### Final Answer:
**-0.20** (approximate, based on structural analogies).

Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.5995473417569729
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Aromaticity and Conjugation**: 
   - Molecules with extended aromatic systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatics) tend to have more negative property values. For example:
     - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (a large polycyclic aromatic) has a very negative value: **-2.06094399**.
     - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a fused aromatic system) has **-1.51760421**.
   - Simpler aromatic systems like benzene derivatives often have less negative values (e.g., **Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O** with **-1.18035883**).

2. **Biphenyl-like Structures**:
   - The molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** is biphenyl, which consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond. This is less conjugated than fused polycyclic aromatics but more conjugated than a single benzene ring.
   - From the examples, **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (a naphthalene derivative with methyl groups) has a value of **-0.35598123**, which is less negative than fused systems but still reflects some aromaticity.

3. **Non-Aromatic/Aliphatic Systems**:
   - Aliphatic or less conjugated systems (e.g., **CCCCCCC** or **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**) have positive values (e.g., **0.8618493**).

### Prediction for Biphenyl:
- Biphenyl is not as conjugated as fused polycyclic aromatics but more conjugated than a single benzene ring. Its property value should be less negative than fused systems but still negative due to aromaticity.
- Comparing to similar structures:
  - **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (naphthalene derivative): **-0.35598123**.
  - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (fused aromatic): **-1.51760421**.
- Biphenyl is intermediate, so a reasonable estimate is slightly more negative than the naphthalene derivative but less negative than fused systems.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.65** (approximate, based on interpolation between the given examples). 

This reflects its aromatic conjugation while accounting for the lack of fusion in the ring system.

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 1.1897267562989942
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as size, polarity, functional groups, and aromaticity. Let's analyze the molecule **CCCCS** (butyl mercaptan or 1-butanethiol) in the context of the given data:

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., C1CCC2CCCCC2C1, CCC1CCCCC1, CCCC(C)(C)C)** tend to have property values around **0.86**.
2. **Small polar/aliphatic molecules (e.g., CC(O)C(C)(C)C, OC1CCCCCCC1, CC1CO1)** have values around **0.82**.
3. **Molecules with sulfur (e.g., CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSc1ccc(Cl)cc1)** can have higher values (e.g., **1.59** for a complex thiophosphate), but simpler thiols/sulfides are not directly represented in the examples.
4. **CCCCS** is a small aliphatic thiol, which introduces slight polarity due to the -SH group but is not as bulky or polar as some of the higher-valued sulfur-containing examples.

### Comparison:
- The closest analogs are aliphatic chains like **CCCC(=C)C (0.618)** and **CCCCCCCC=C (0.618)**, but **CCCCS** has a sulfur atom, which may slightly increase the value compared to pure hydrocarbons.
- The sulfur in **CCCCS** is less polarizing than in **P(=S)** or **SCS** systems (which have higher values), so the increase over aliphatic hydrocarbons should be modest.

### Prediction:
Given the above, **CCCCS** likely has a property value **between 0.82 and 0.86**, closer to the aliphatic baseline but slightly higher due to the sulfur. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.85** (rounded from a plausible range of 0.84–0.86). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an interpolation based on the given examples.)

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.8243775949158385
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains with Oxygen (Alcohols/Ethers):**
   - **CCCC(C)(O)CC**: 0.82437759  
     (Branched hydrocarbon with a hydroxyl group)
   - **CCCCOC**: 0.82437759  
     (Linear hydrocarbon with an ether group)
   - **CC(C)CC(C)O**: 0.82437759  
     (Branched hydrocarbon with a hydroxyl group)
   - **CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O**: 0.82437759  
     (Cyclic hydrocarbon with a hydroxyl group)

   These examples suggest that **branched or linear hydrocarbons with a single oxygen (OH or O-ether)** tend to have a property value around **0.82437759**.

2. **Similarity to the Target Molecule:**
   - The target molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is a branched hydrocarbon with a terminal hydroxyl group (similar to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** and **CC(C)CC(C)O**).

3. **Other Functional Groups:**
   - Molecules with polar or electronegative groups (e.g., Cl, Br, NO₂, SO₂) tend to deviate from this value, but **CCCC(C)(C)CO** lacks such groups.
   - The presence of additional rings or unsaturation also affects the value, but this molecule is a simple aliphatic alcohol.

### Conclusion:
Given the consistency in property values for similar branched/linear alcohols, the predicted property value for **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.82437759**

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.35598123416820265
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene) has a property value of **0.13115098**.
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1C** (toluene derivative) also has the same value (**0.13115098**), suggesting that simple alkyl substitutions on benzene do not significantly alter the property.
   - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (methyl-substituted naphthalene) has a value of **-0.35598123**, indicating that fused aromatic rings (like naphthalene) reduce the property value compared to benzene.

2. **Fused Aromatic Systems**:
   - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (a methyl-substituted anthracene/phenanthrene-like structure) has a value of **-0.84311345**, showing that larger fused aromatic systems further decrease the property value.
   - The given molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is a methyl-substituted naphthalene, similar to **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** but with the methyl group in a different position.

3. **Methyl Substitution**:
   - Methyl substitutions on aromatic systems (e.g., **Cc1cccc(C)c1**, **Cc1ccc(C)cc1**) consistently show a property value of **0.13115098** when the core is benzene, but fused systems like naphthalene reduce this value.

### Prediction:
The molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is a methyl-substituted naphthalene. Comparing it to the given examples:
- The naphthalene core (**c1ccc2ccccc2c1**) would likely reduce the property value compared to benzene.
- The methyl substitution alone does not significantly increase the value (as seen in benzene derivatives), but the fused ring system dominates the trend.

The closest analog in the given examples is **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12**, which has a value of **-0.35598123**. Since **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is structurally very similar (just a positional isomer of the methyl group), we can expect a similar property value.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is **-0.35598123**.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: -0.6838586866915475
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic urea derivative with two carbonyl groups. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **-0.68385869**.
   - The hydantoin core is polar and likely contributes negatively to the property value (as seen in the example).

2. **Substituents**: 
   - The hydantoin core is substituted with **C(C)CCC** (a branched alkyl chain) and **CC=C** (an alkenyl group). 
   - The **C(C)CCC** group is a moderately hydrophobic substituent, similar to **CC=C** in the example but slightly larger. 
   - The **CC=C** group is the same as in the example, contributing similarly.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The closest analog is **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** with a value of **-0.68385869**.
   - Adding the **C(C)CCC** group introduces slightly more hydrophobicity, which may slightly increase the property value (make it less negative) compared to the simpler **C** substituent in the example.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarity to the example but with a slightly larger hydrophobic substituent, the property value should be **slightly less negative** than **-0.68385869**. A reasonable estimate would be around:

**-0.65**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on structural trends in the provided data, where larger hydrophobic groups tend to increase the property value toward less negative numbers.) 

### Final Answer:
**-0.65** (approximate, based on structural analogy).

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.06557549050466892
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/LogP Trends**:
   - The property values seem to correlate with **logP (partition coefficient)**, where higher values indicate greater hydrophobicity (lipophilicity), and lower (or negative) values indicate greater hydrophility.
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., **CCCCC**, **C1CCCC1**) have high values (~0.86), indicating high hydrophobicity.
   - Polar or electronegative groups (e.g., **-OH**, **-O-**, **-C=O**, **-N-**, halogens) reduce the property value (more negative or less positive).

2. **Halogenated Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**: Property = 1.086 (iodine and chlorine increase hydrophobicity).
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = 1.030 (multiple chlorines increase hydrophobicity but less than iodine).
   - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**: Property = 0.393 (bromine increases hydrophobicity, but -OH reduces it).
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: Property = 0.487 (fewer chlorines than the previous example).

3. **Fluorinated Compounds**:
   - No explicit examples of fluorinated aromatics are given, but fluorine is highly electronegative and typically reduces hydrophobicity compared to other halogens (Cl, Br, I).

4. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple benzene rings with nonpolar substituents (e.g., **CCc1ccccc1CC**) have modest positive values (~0.13).
   - Polar or electronegative substituents (e.g., **-C=O**, **-O-**) reduce the value (e.g., **COc1ccccc1O** = -0.24).

### Prediction for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1:
- The molecule is **trifluoromethylbenzene (C6H5CF3)**.
- The **-CF3 group** is highly electronegative and polar, which will reduce hydrophobicity compared to a simple benzene or alkyl-substituted benzene.
- However, it is less polar than **-OH** or **-C=O**, so the reduction won't be as severe as in those cases.
- Comparing to similar halogenated aromatics:
  - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (1.086) and **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (1.030) are much more hydrophobic due to Cl/I.
  - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (0.393) has a Br (hydrophobic) but also an -OH (hydrophilic), balancing to a moderate value.
  - **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** has three fluorines, which are less hydrophobic than Cl/Br/I but still somewhat lipophilic.

Given these trends, the property value for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is likely **moderately positive but lower than chlorinated/iodinated analogs**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.5** (approximate, based on interpolation of the given examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the apparent logP-like behavior in the data.)

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 0.6370190506167843
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and the presence of functional groups like hydroxyl (-OH), carbonyl (C=O), halogens, aromatic rings, and nitrogen-containing groups. 

The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar derivative (likely a hexose like glucose or a similar polyol). It has **five hydroxyl groups (-OH)** and an **ether linkage (O in the ring)**, making it highly polar and capable of extensive hydrogen bonding. 

From the examples:
- Molecules with multiple -OH groups (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, property = 0.63701905) tend to have **positive property values** in the range of ~0.5–0.8. 
- The presence of -OH groups increases the property value, while electronegative atoms (e.g., Cl, N, S) or aromatic systems with polar substituents tend to decrease it (negative values).

Given that this molecule has even more -OH groups than the example above (5 vs. 4) and no negatively contributing features (like halogens or nitro groups), its property value should be **higher than 0.63701905** but likely below 1.0 (since very simple alcohols like **CC(C)C(C)O** and **CCC(C)(O)CC** are ~0.824). 

### Predicted property value: **~0.75**  
(Exact prediction without statistical modeling is challenging, but this is a reasonable estimate based on the trend.)  

If forced to pick from the examples' range, the closest analog is **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO (0.63701905)**, but with one additional -OH, I'd adjust slightly upward to **~0.70–0.80**.  

**Final answer: 0.75** (approximate interpolation).

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: -0.8150096677008856
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural observations:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a polycyclic steroid-like structure with multiple rings (similar to some of the larger molecules in the examples, e.g., `CCC1(=O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C`).
2. **Functional groups**:
   - Two ketone groups (`C=O`).
   - An ester group (`CC(=O)OCC(=O)`).
   - Hydroxyl groups (`C(O)`).
   - A conjugated double bond (`C=CC=C`).
3. **Size and complexity**: The molecule is large and has significant steric and electronic complexity.

### Comparison to examples:
- Molecules with **ketones and hydroxyl groups** (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`) tend to have **moderate positive values (~0.6)**.
- **Steroid-like structures** with ketones (e.g., `CCC1(=O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C`) have **negative values (~-0.18 to -0.73)**.
- The presence of **ester groups** (e.g., `CCOC(=O)C`) tends to give **moderate positive values (~0.36)**.
- The **conjugated system** (`C=CC=C`) may slightly lower the value (similar to aromatic systems).

### Synthesis of trends:
1. The steroid core with ketones suggests a **negative contribution**.
2. The ester group adds a **positive contribution**.
3. The hydroxyl groups add a **moderate positive contribution**.
4. The conjugated system may slightly **reduce the value**.

Given these competing effects, the net property value is likely **slightly negative**, similar to other steroid-like molecules in the examples. 

### Closest matches:
- `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` has a value of **-0.18735854**.
- `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` has a value of **0.27166989**.

Our molecule has **more polar groups (ester, hydroxyls)** than the first example but **less than the second**, so the value should lie between these two. The ester group likely dominates, pushing it closer to the first example.

### Predicted value:
**-0.15** (slightly less negative than `-0.187` due to the additional polar groups). 

However, looking more carefully, the molecule is very similar to `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (value = `-0.18735854`), but with an extra hydroxyl group and a conjugated double bond. The hydroxyl group would increase the value slightly (less negative), while the conjugation might have a small opposing effect. 

Thus, a refined prediction is:  
**-0.15 to -0.10**.

But to match the precision of the examples, I'll select:  
**-0.13115098** (a value seen in other moderately polar, complex molecules like `CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O`). 

### Final answer:
**-0.13115098**

Iteration: 16
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 0.5152359968223992
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group contributions. The molecule in question is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, an alcohol group (-OH), and a ketone group (C=O). 

Key observations from the examples:
1. Molecules with -OH groups (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl`, `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cc2cc(Cl)ccc2O`) tend to have property values around **-0.4 to 0.2**.
2. Molecules with ketones (C=O) (e.g., `CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O`, `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1`) tend to have negative values around **-0.4 to -0.5**.
3. Steroid-like or polycyclic structures (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O`) have values around **-0.09**.

The molecule `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O` has:
- A ketone (C=O) contributing negatively (~ -0.4).
- An alcohol (-OH) contributing slightly negatively or neutrally (~ -0.1 to 0.1).
- A polycyclic (steroid-like) framework, which may slightly raise the value (as seen in `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` with **-0.093**).

Combining these effects, the predicted property value is likely close to the steroid-like example with -OH and C=O, i.e., **~ -0.09 to -0.2**. 

Given the additional ketone in this molecule (compared to `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O`), the value might be slightly more negative. 

### Final predicted property value: **-0.15** (approximate, based on structural similarity to the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. The true value could vary if the property depends on other unobserved factors.)

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.927424794280318
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CC(=O)N)**: This is an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) due to the carbonyl (C=O) and nitrogen (N) with lone pair delocalization.
   - **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: A strong EWG, which significantly decreases electron density in the aromatic ring.
   - **Aromatic ring (c1ccc(cc1))**: The ring is substituted with two EWGs (acetamide and nitro), making it highly electron-deficient.

2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1**: Contains an aldehyde (C=O) and methoxy (OCH3) group. Property = -0.365.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1**: Nitrobenzene. Property = -0.431.
   - **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: Methoxy-nitrobenzene. Property = -0.618.
   - **O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2**: Contains nitro and amide groups. Property = -1.667.

3. **Trends**:
   - Nitro groups tend to lower the property value (more negative).
   - Amides (especially aromatic amides) also lower the value but less than nitro groups.
   - The presence of two EWGs (nitro and acetamide) on the same ring suggests additive electron-withdrawing effects, leading to a more negative value than nitrobenzene alone (-0.431) but less extreme than the highly substituted -1.667 example.

### Prediction:
Given the two strong EWGs (nitro and acetamide) on the aromatic ring, the property value should be more negative than nitrobenzene (-0.431) but not as extreme as the -1.667 example (which has additional complexity). A reasonable estimate is between **-0.7 and -1.0**.

Looking at similar examples:
- **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (methoxy + nitro) = -0.618.
- **O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12** (nitro + fused ring) = -0.918.

The molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has stronger EWGs than methoxy, so its value should be more negative than -0.618 but less than -0.918. A plausible value is **-0.730** (close to the example **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O**, which has nitro and amide-like features and a value of -0.730).

### Final Answer:
**-0.73069832** (rounded to the same decimal places as the examples).

Iteration: 18
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 0.5808114873270681
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: This is a polar and moderately electron-withdrawing group. Similar groups in the examples (e.g., esters, amides) tend to lower the property value (e.g., **COC(=O)Nc2nc1ccc(cc1[nH]2)C(=O)c3ccccc3** has a very low value of -2.089).
2. **Aromatic system with Cl substitution**: The presence of **Cl** on the aromatic ring (like in **Clc1cccc2ccccc12**, property = -0.084) suggests a slight decrease in the property value compared to unsubstituted aromatics.
3. **Heterocycle (n1c(=O)oc2...)**: The **oxo (C=O)** and **thioether (S)** in the heterocycle are electron-withdrawing, similar to **Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property = -0.618) or **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property = -0.806), which lower the value.
4. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**: These are moderately polar but not as strongly electron-withdrawing as halogens or carbonyls. Compare to **CCCO** (property = 0.824) or **CCCC(C)O** (property = 0.824), but here they are attached to P=O, which changes their effect.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **Cl-substituted aromatics**: Values range from **-0.084** (monosubstituted) to **0.946** (perchlorinated). Here, there is one Cl, so expect a slight decrease.
- **Polar/heterocyclic systems**: Values are often negative (e.g., **-0.618** for **Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2**).
- **Phosphorothioate**: No direct examples, but analogous polar groups (e.g., **CSSC** = 1.517) are outliers. The P=S group here is less extreme but still polar.

### Synthesis of Trends:
The molecule combines:
1. A **Cl-substituted aromatic** (slight decrease).
2. A **polar heterocycle with C=O and S** (moderate decrease).
3. A **phosphorothioate group** (polar, likely decrease).
4. **Ethoxy groups** (minor increase, but offset by P=S).

Given these competing effects, the property value is likely **negative**, similar to other polar/heterocyclic molecules in the dataset. 

### Closest Analogues:
- **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property = -0.806): Heterocycle with polar groups.
- **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (property = -0.084): Cl-substituted aromatic.
- **Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property = -0.618): Heterocycle with N and C=O.

The presence of **P=S** and **Cl** suggests a value more negative than -0.618 but not as extreme as -2.089 (which has multiple strong electron-withdrawing groups).

### Predicted Value:
A reasonable estimate is **-1.0 to -1.5**. Given the examples, I predict:
**-1.25** (interpolating between similar molecules).

However, looking at **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property = -1.386), which has a polar heterocycle and aromatic system, our molecule is somewhat similar but with P=S instead of C=O. Thus, a slightly less negative value is plausible.

### Final Prediction:
**-1.1** (specific value within the expected range). 

Given the dataset's precision, I round to **-1.10000000**. 

However, since the examples are more precise, I'll align with the nearest observed trend and predict:
**-1.02110407** (same as **c1c(O)C2C(=O)C3cc(O)ccC3OC2cc1(OC)** due to similar polarity/complexity). 

But more accurately, given the Cl and P=S, a unique value is likely. 

After careful consideration, the predicted property value is:
**-1.20000000**. 

(Note: Without a clear linear trend or model, this is an approximate interpolation based on structural similarity.) 

For consistency with the given examples, the most plausible answer is:
**-1.02110407**. 

But given the additional P=S and Cl, adjust slightly lower:
**-1.15000000**. 

Given the options, I select **-1.15000000** as the final prediction. 

However, the exact value cannot be precisely determined without a model, so this is an educated estimate. 

### Final Answer:
**-1.15000000** (approximated based on structural analogs in the dataset). 

(Note: In practice, a QSAR model or descriptor-based calculation would be needed for higher precision.) 

---

**Correction**: Reviewing the examples again, **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property = -1.386) is a closer match due to the **sulfur** and **aromatic + polar groups**. Our molecule has **P=S** (more polar than C=O) and **Cl**, so the value should be slightly more negative than -1.386. 

Thus, a better prediction is:
**-1.40000000**. 

But to match the precision of the examples, I'll use:
**-1.38645323** (same as the closest analog). 

### Revised Final Answer:
**-1.38645323**. 

(Note: This aligns with the most structurally similar example in the dataset.) 

---

**Final Decision**: After careful comparison, the molecule most closely resembles **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** in polarity and functional groups, so the predicted property value is:
**-1.38645323**. 

---

**Answer**: The predicted property value for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12** is **-1.38645323**.

SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.8243775949158385
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can analyze the patterns in the molecular structures and their corresponding property values to predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**.

### Observations:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**: 
   - Molecules with a terminal hydroxyl group (**-OH**) and alkyl chains tend to have property values around **0.82437759**. Examples:
     - `CCCCCCC(C)O` → 0.82437759
     - `CC(C)CO` → 0.82437759
     - `CCCCCCCC(C)O` → 0.82437759
     - `CCCCC(CC)CO` → 0.82437759
     - `CCCC(O)CCC` → 0.82437759
     - `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO` → 0.82437759
   - The length or branching of the alkyl chain does not significantly change the property value as long as the **-OH** group is present.

2. **Branching**:
   - The molecule `CC(C)(C)CO` is a branched alcohol (tert-butanol derivative), similar to `CC(C)CO` (isopropanol derivative), which also has a value of **0.82437759**.

3. **Other Functional Groups**:
   - The presence of other functional groups (e.g., halogens, nitro groups, double bonds, rings) tends to decrease the property value (often to negative values). Since `CC(C)(C)CO` is purely an alcohol with no such groups, the value should align with other simple alcohols.

### Prediction:
The molecule **CC(C)(C)CO** is a tertiary alcohol with no additional functional groups, so its property value should be consistent with other simple alcohols in the dataset.

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -0.6838586866915479
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Heterocyclic Nitrogen-Containing Aromatics**: 
   - Molecules with multiple nitrogen atoms in aromatic rings (e.g., purines, pyrimidines) tend to have negative property values. 
   - Example: **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (a purine-like structure) has a value of **-0.80564174**.
   - Example: **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (a pyrimidine derivative) has a value of **-0.44029258**.

2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - The presence of carbonyl (C=O) or amide (N-C=O) groups often reduces the property value further.
   - Example: **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)CC=C** (with multiple amides) has a value of **-0.92742479**.

3. **Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - Molecules with NH or OH groups (e.g., **Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4**) tend to have more negative values due to increased polarity.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** is a **purine-2,6-dione** (hypoxanthine-like structure) with:
- Two fused aromatic rings (imidazole + pyrimidine).
- Two NH groups (hydrogen bond donors).
- One carbonyl (C=O) group (hydrogen bond acceptor).
- High polarity due to multiple heteroatoms and hydrogen bonding.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (purine derivative): **-0.80564174**.
- **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (pyrimidine derivative): **-0.44029258**.
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)CC=C** (multiple amides): **-0.92742479**.

Given the high polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity of the target molecule, its value should be more negative than **-0.80564174** (due to the additional NH group and carbonyl) but less negative than **-0.92742479** (since it lacks multiple amides). 

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **-0.85**. 

However, looking at the closest structural analog (**COc2ncc1nccnc1n2**, **-0.80564174**), the target molecule is slightly more polar due to the NH groups, so we adjust downward slightly. 

**Final Prediction: -0.83** (rounded from an interpolated value between -0.805 and -0.927). 

---
**Answer: -0.83** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the data).

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.36534916138315576
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Alcohols/Ethers**:
   - Molecules like **CCCCCC(C)O** (hexan-2-ol), **CC(C)O** (isopropanol), and **CC(O)C(C)(C)C** (tert-butanol) all have a property value of **0.82437759**. These are neutral, polar aliphatic compounds with no strong electron-withdrawing or donating groups.
   - **CCOC(C)C** (ethyl isopropyl ether) also has the same value (**0.82437759**), suggesting that ethers and alcohols with similar aliphatic structures share this property.

2. **Esters and Carbonyl-Containing Compounds**:
   - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (triethyl phosphate) has a higher value (**0.9648965**), likely due to the phosphoryl group.
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a steroid-like ester) has a value of **-0.18735854**, indicating that esters can vary but tend to be slightly lower than simple alcohols/ethers.
   - **CCCCC(=O)OCC** (an ester) has a value of **0.36534916**, which is intermediate.

3. **Polarity and Functional Groups**:
   - The presence of **C=O** (carbonyl) in esters or aldehydes tends to reduce the property value compared to simple alcohols/ethers. For example:
     - **COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67** (a complex polyfunctional molecule) has a very low value (**-2.25767046**), but this is likely due to multiple polar groups.
     - **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (an aldehyde) has a value of **-0.36534916**.

### Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate):
- This is a simple ester with an aliphatic group (**CC(C)**) and a carbonyl (**C=O**). 
- Compared to **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (value: **-0.18735854**), methyl acetate is less complex and might have a slightly higher value.
- Compared to **CCCCC(=O)OCC** (value: **0.36534916**), methyl acetate is smaller but structurally similar (both are esters).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Simple alcohols/ethers have a value of **0.82437759**.
- Esters tend to have lower values, e.g., **0.36534916** for **CCCCC(=O)OCC**.
- Methyl acetate is a small ester, so its value should be close to **0.36534916** but possibly slightly higher due to its simplicity.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is **~0.55**. 

However, looking more closely, **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** has a value of **-0.18735854**, which seems too low for methyl acetate. A more reasonable estimate, considering the trend for small esters, is closer to **0.55** (similar to **CCCC(=O)CC**, which has **0.55270771**).

Thus, the predicted value is **0.55270771**.

SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: -1.2834060284485207
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Group**: The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl rings (aromatic groups) attached to the nitrogen atoms of the urea moiety (**N-C(=O)-N**). 
   - Urea-like structures in the examples (e.g., `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1`) tend to have negative property values (e.g., `-0.31850953`), suggesting that the urea core contributes to lowering the property value.
   - The presence of two aromatic rings (phenyl groups) may further influence the property. Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing or donating substituents can modulate the property, but here they are unsubstituted.

2. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` (property: `-0.55270771`): This is a carbamate with aromatic rings and alkyl substituents. The urea derivative here is likely to have a similar or slightly less negative value due to the lack of alkyl substituents.
   - `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (property: `-0.31850953`): This is a cyclic urea with alkyl groups. The linear urea with two phenyl groups in the target molecule may have a more negative value due to increased conjugation and potential electron-withdrawing effects.

3. **Symmetry and Conjugation**:
   - The molecule is symmetric with two phenyl rings, which may stabilize the structure and slightly reduce the property value compared to asymmetric or alkyl-substituted ureas.

### Predicted Property:
Given the urea core and two aromatic rings, the property value is likely **negative** and moderately sized. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

This aligns with the trend where urea derivatives with aromatic groups exhibit negative values in the range of `-0.3` to `-0.6`. The symmetry and lack of additional polar substituents suggest a value around the middle of this range. 

(Note: Without explicit knowledge of the property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or a quantum-chemical parameter—this is an educated estimate based on structural analogs.)

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -0.5995473417569729
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is **fluorene**, which consists of two benzene rings fused to a central five-membered ring (cyclopentadiene). It is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with significant aromatic character due to the conjugated π-electron system across the rings.

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative (e.g., `Fc1cccc(F)c1` = 0.0, `CNc1ccccc1` = -0.056).
   - Larger conjugated systems (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1`) have more negative values (-1.330), likely due to increased electron delocalization.
   - Fluorene is intermediate in size between benzene and larger PAHs.

2. **Fused Rings**: 
   - Fused aromatic systems (e.g., naphthalene-like structures) often have moderately negative values (e.g., `c1c(OC)c(OC)C2C(=O)OCC2c1` = -0.496).
   - Fluorene is similar but has a partially saturated central ring, which may reduce conjugation slightly compared to fully aromatic fused systems.

3. **Electron-Withdrawing/Donating Groups**: 
   - The given molecule has no substituents, so its value should reflect the bare fused-ring system.

### Comparison to Closest Examples:
- `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (large PAH): -1.330  
- `c1c(OC)c(OC)C2C(=O)OCC2c1` (fused rings with substituents): -0.496  
- `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (two linked benzene rings): -0.974  

Fluorene is smaller than the first example but more conjugated than the third. Its central ring reduces full aromaticity, so its value should be less negative than -1.330 but more negative than -0.496.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate for **fluorene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13)** is:  
**-0.85**  

This balances its aromaticity and size against the provided examples.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the assumption that the values correlate with electron delocalization or hydrophobicity. If the property is something else, the reasoning would adjust accordingly.)  

**Final answer: -0.85**

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -0.7869058860560272
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O))**, which is highly polar and often associated with negative property values (e.g., increased hydrophilicity or decreased logP).
   - It also has **two primary amine groups (NH2)**: one attached to the sulfonamide nitrogen and one on the phenyl ring. These are polar and can form hydrogen bonds, further decreasing the property value.

2. **Aromatic Ring**:
   - The phenyl ring is substituted with an electron-donating amine group, which can slightly increase polarity.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with sulfonamide groups (e.g., **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O**, property = -0.73069832) tend to have negative values.
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12**, property = -0.67449076) also show negative values.
   - The presence of **two amines and a sulfonamide** suggests a stronger polar character than most of the examples, likely leading to a more negative value.

4. **Lack of Hydrophobic Moieties**:
   - There are no long alkyl chains or nonpolar groups to offset the polarity, unlike some examples with mixed polar/nonpolar regions (e.g., **CCCCCOC(=O)C**, property = 0.36534916).

### Predicted Property:
Given the high polarity and resemblance to other sulfonamide-containing molecules with negative values, the predicted property for **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** is likely in the range of **-1.0 to -1.5**. 

A reasonable estimate, considering the examples, is:  
**-1.20846261** (similar to **COC1=CC(=O)CC(C)C13Oc2c(Cl)c(OC)cc(OC)c2C3=O**, which has multiple polar groups and a complex structure).

### Final Answer:
**-1.20846261**

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.6206514081868193
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure features. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O

### Key structural features:
1. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O):** The molecule has two nitro groups, which are strongly electron-withdrawing. In the examples, nitro groups tend to decrease the property value (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a value of `-0.6182832`).
2. **Trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F):** This is another strong electron-withdrawing group, which likely further decreases the property value.
3. **Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C)):** While amines can sometimes increase the property value, the presence of strong electron-withdrawing groups nearby may mitigate this effect.
4. **Aromatic ring with substitutions:** The aromatic ring is heavily substituted with nitro and trifluoromethyl groups, which are strongly deactivating.

### Comparison with similar examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups and other electron-withdrawing groups tend to have highly negative property values (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` has `-1.69559483`).
- The presence of two nitro groups and a trifluoromethyl group suggests an even stronger electron-withdrawing effect, likely leading to a very negative value.

### Predicted property value:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents, the property value is likely to be highly negative. A reasonable prediction would be close to the most negative values in the examples, such as `-1.69559483` or even more negative.

**Final prediction:** `-1.81737788` (similar to highly conjugated, heavily substituted aromatic systems with strong electron-withdrawing groups). 

This aligns with the trend observed in the examples where multiple nitro groups and other electron-withdrawing substituents lead to very low property values.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.36534916138315576
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Aliphatic alcohols (e.g., CCCC(C)O, CCCCCCCCO, OC1CCCCCC1)**: These tend to have a property value of **~0.824**.
   - **Esters or aldehydes with short chains (e.g., CC(=O)N, CC(C)CCOC=O, CCCC=O)**: These tend to have values around **0.365 to 0.553**.
   - **Molecules with aromatic rings and polar groups (e.g., Clc1ccccc1, c1ccccc1)**: These have values around **0.131 to 0.403**.
   - **Highly polar or complex heterocycles (e.g., Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl, O2c1cc(C)ccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(N)cnc23)**: These have negative values (e.g., **-0.834 to -1.536**).

2. **CC(C)OC=O**:
   - This is an ester (isopropyl formate: **HCOOCH(CH3)2**).
   - Similar molecules:
     - **CC(C)CCOC=O** (an ester with a slightly longer chain) has a value of **0.365**.
     - **CC(=O)N** (an amide) has a value of **0.365**.
     - **CCCC=O** (an aldehyde) has a value of **0.553**.
   - Esters seem to cluster around **0.365**, while aldehydes are slightly higher (~0.553). Since **CC(C)OC=O** is a simpler ester than **CC(C)CCOC=O**, it may have a similar or slightly higher value.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CC(C)CCOC=O (0.365)** and **CC(=O)N (0.365)**, the predicted property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is likely in the same range. 

**Final predicted value: 0.365** (matching the trend for small esters/aldehydes). 

Thus, the answer is:  
**0.36534916** (consistent with the observed pattern).

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.0562075632897162
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Oxygen (O)**: 
   - Molecules with hydroxyl groups (-OH) or ethers (e.g., COC) tend to have negative property values. For example:
     - COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1 → -0.927
     - Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 → -1.845
     - c1ccc(cc1)O → -0.056
   - The more hydroxyl groups, the more negative the value tends to be.

2. **Alkyl Groups (e.g., CH3, C2H5)**:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., CC(C)C, CCC(C)CCO) tend to have positive values (~0.82 to 0.86).
   - Aromatic rings with alkyl substitutions (e.g., Cc1ccccc1C → 0.131) have slightly positive values unless balanced by polar groups.

3. **Aromatic Rings with Mixed Substituents**:
   - Aromatic rings with both alkyl and polar groups (e.g., hydroxyl) tend to have values between -0.5 and 0. For example:
     - Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)c2cc(c(Cl)cc2O)S(N)(=O)=O → -1.096 (but this has many polar groups)
     - c1ccc(cc1)O → -0.056 (single hydroxyl on benzene).

4. **Halogens (Cl, Br, I)**:
   - Halogenated aromatics (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c2 → 0.487) tend to have positive values, but this is not directly relevant here.

### Analysis of **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**:
- The molecule is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (toluene derivative with a hydroxyl group at the para position and another methyl group).
- It has:
  - One hydroxyl group (-OH) → contributes to a negative value.
  - Two methyl groups (electron-donating, hydrophobic) → contribute to a positive value.
  - Aromatic ring → neutral to slightly negative influence.
- Comparable examples:
  - c1ccc(cc1)O (phenol) → -0.056
  - Cc1ccccc1C (dimethylbenzene) → 0.131
  - The hydroxyl group here is balanced by two methyl groups, so the value should be slightly more negative than phenol but not as extreme as polyhydroxy aromatics.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance between the hydroxyl group (-OH) and the methyl groups (CH3), the property value is likely **slightly negative**, similar to phenol but adjusted for the additional methyl group. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: -0.15**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples. Without a clear quantitative trend or model, the exact value is uncertain, but it should fall in the range of -0.2 to 0.)

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.8056417404859331
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P(=S)) Groups**: 
   - Molecules with **P(=S)** groups tend to have **high positive property values** (e.g., 1.47076457, 1.70496275, 1.29277396). This suggests that the **P(=S) moiety** strongly contributes to increasing the property value.
   - The presence of **halogens (Cl, Br, I)** further increases the value (e.g., 1.70496275 for I, 1.47076457 for Br, 1.29277396 for Cl).

2. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**:
   - Aromatic rings with **electron-withdrawing groups (Cl, Br, I, NO2)** tend to increase the property value (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 → 0.94616065).
   - Aromatic rings with **electron-donating groups (OH, CH3)** tend to decrease the property value (e.g., Cc1ccc(O)c(C)c1 → -0.05620756).

3. **Thioether (S-C) Group**:
   - The presence of **SC** (thioether) in the aromatic ring is not explicitly represented in the examples, but sulfur-containing groups (e.g., P(=S)) are associated with higher values.

4. **Comparison with Similar Structures**:
   - The closest analog in the examples is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** (property = 1.29277396), which has a P(=S) group and multiple Cl substituents.
   - Our molecule replaces two Cl atoms with **SC and CH3**, which are less electron-withdrawing than Cl but still moderately polarizable.

### Prediction:
- The **P(=S)** group dominates the property value, pushing it into the **positive range**.
- The **SC** group is less electron-withdrawing than Cl but still contributes positively (though not as strongly as halogens).
- The **CH3** group is weakly electron-donating, slightly reducing the value.

Given these factors, the predicted property value for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** is likely **slightly lower than the Cl-substituted analog** but still significantly positive. 

### Final Prediction:
**1.1** (approximate, likely between 1.0 and 1.3 based on the examples).  

For specificity, I would estimate:  
**1.15** (interpolating between the P(=S) examples and accounting for the SC/CH3 substituents).  

However, since the examples with P(=S) and halogens are in the **1.2–1.7 range**, and our molecule has **SC instead of Cl**, a reasonable estimate is:  
**1.25** (closer to the lower end of the P(=S) examples due to reduced halogen influence).  

But reviewing the data again, **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** is 1.29277396, and our molecule replaces two Cl with SC/CH3, so a slight reduction is warranted.  

Thus, the final predicted value:  
**1.15** (rounded from interpolation).  

However, the most consistent match is **slightly below 1.29277396**, so:  
**Predicted property value: 1.20** (balance between P(=S) and SC/CH3 effects).  

Given the uncertainty, I'd lean toward **1.20 ± 0.1**.  

### Exact Answer:  
**1.20** (based on structural analogy and trends in the data).

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.7588021044111695
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, the property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, halogenation (especially chlorine substitution), and aromaticity. Key observations:

1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic systems** consistently show high positive values (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` = **1.03047199**, `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` = **2.49186864**).
2. The molecule `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (hexachlorobenzene analog) has a value of **1.03047199**.
3. The target molecule `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` is structurally similar but with slightly less chlorine substitution (7 Cl atoms vs. 8 in the example above) and a biphenyl-like structure.

Given the pattern:
- The biphenyl core with 7 chlorines would likely have a value **slightly lower** than the fully chlorinated example (1.03047199) but still in the same range due to similar electronic and steric effects.

**Predicted property value: 0.95**  
*(Approximation based on reduced chlorine count but maintained aromatic halogenation impact)*. 

For higher precision, the exact value would likely fall between **0.90–1.03**, aligning with the trend of polychlorinated aromatics in the dataset.

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.2997736708784867
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aliphatic Chains (e.g., CCC, CCCC, etc.)**: 
   - Simple alkanes like **CCC**, **CC**, and **C1CCCCC1** have property values around **0.8618493**.
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCCC**) retain this value, suggesting that saturated hydrocarbons consistently have high (~0.86) property values.

2. **Polar or Functional Groups**:
   - The presence of polar groups (e.g., **-OH**, **-NO2**, **-C=O**, **-Cl**, etc.) tends to reduce the property value.
   - For example:
     - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)C** (multiple polar groups) has a value of **-0.44029258**.
     - **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (two nitrile groups) has a value of **-0.82437759**.
     - **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** (three nitro groups) has a very low value of **-1.55507592**.

3. **Nitro Group (-NO2)**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups consistently show negative property values.
   - For example:
     - **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (no nitro group) has **-0.82437759**, while adding nitro groups further reduces the value (e.g., **-1.55507592** for a trinitro compound).
     - **CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O** (two nitro groups) has **-1.3770853**.

4. **CCCN(=O)=O**:
   - This is a short aliphatic chain (**CCC**) with a nitro group (**-NO2**).
   - The nitro group's strong electron-withdrawing nature and polarity will significantly reduce the property value compared to pure alkanes.
   - Comparing to similar molecules:
     - **CCC** (no nitro group) has **0.8618493**.
     - Adding a nitro group will likely reduce this to a negative value, similar to other nitro-containing compounds.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Pure alkanes (e.g., **CCC**) have values ~0.86.
- Nitro groups reduce the value significantly (e.g., trinitro compounds go as low as **-1.55**).
- **CCCN(=O)=O** has one nitro group and a short aliphatic chain, so the reduction will be significant but not as extreme as multiple nitro groups.

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.5 and -0.8**. Looking at similar examples:
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)C** (multiple polar groups) has **-0.44029258**.
- **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (two nitrile groups) has **-0.82437759**.
- **CCCN(=O)=O** is closer to the latter in terms of polarity.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCN(=O)=O** is approximately **-0.75**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.75** (estimated based on the trend of nitro groups reducing the property value significantly).

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.5152359968223991
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations:
1. **Halogen Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br, F) tend to have higher property values, especially when multiple halogens are present. For example:
     - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: 0.85248138 (Cl and Br)
     - **BrC(Br)Br**: 2.21083082 (3 Br atoms)
     - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O**: 1.22719847 (multiple Cl atoms)
   - The presence of Br generally contributes more to the property value than Cl or F.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Halogens**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: 0.85248138 (Cl and Br on benzene)
   - **COc1cccc(Cl)c1**: 0.21546233 (Cl on benzene)
   - **COc1ccccc1Cl**: 0.21546233 (Cl on benzene)
   - **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is structurally similar to these, with F and Br substitutions on a benzene ring.

3. **Electron-Withdrawing Effects**:
   - Fluorine (F) is more electron-withdrawing than Cl or Br, but Br is larger and may have a stronger steric/electronic effect on the property.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (Cl and Br on benzene): 0.85248138
   - **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** replaces Cl with F. Since F is more electronegative but smaller than Cl, the property value might be slightly lower than the Cl/Br case but still significant due to the Br.

### Prediction:
Given that **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** has F and Br substitutions (similar to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** but with F instead of Cl), we can expect the property value to be slightly lower than 0.85248138 but still in a similar range. A reasonable estimate would be around **0.75**.

However, looking at other examples like **COc1cccc(Cl)c1** (0.21546233) and **COc1ccccc1Cl** (0.21546233), where Cl alone gives ~0.215, and Br tends to increase the value significantly, the Br in **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** will dominate. 

Given that **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** is 0.85248138, replacing Cl with F (slightly less impactful than Cl for this property), the value might drop slightly. A good prediction is:

**Predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1: 0.78**

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at the trend:
- Br adds ~0.6-1.3 to the base value (e.g., **CCCBr**: 1.31150981, **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: 0.85248138).
- F is less impactful than Cl or Br, so the value should be between 0.6 and 0.9.

Given **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** is 0.852, **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is likely slightly lower, so:

**Final predicted value: 0.80**

However, to match the precision of the given examples, I'll round to:

**Predicted property value: 0.798** (but since most examples are to ~8 decimal places, I'll align with the trend and say **0.798** is reasonable.)

But given the examples, the closest match is likely slightly lower than **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**, so:

**Final answer: 0.80** (or more precisely, **0.798**). 

Given the data, I'll stick with **0.80** as the most reasonable prediction. 

**Predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1: 0.80**

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 0.8243775949158385
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains with Halogens or Oxygen**:
   - **CBr**: 1.31150981 (bromine increases the value)
   - **CCCCBr**: 1.31150981 (similar to CBr, length doesn't change much)
   - **CCCC(C)(C)O**: 0.82437759 (tertiary alcohol)
   - **CC(C)COC=O**: 0.36534916 (ester-like structure reduces value)
   - **CCCOCCC**: 0.82437759 (ether linkage, similar to alcohols)

2. **Cyclic Structures with Oxygen or Nitrogen**:
   - **CC1CCCO1**: 0.82437759 (cyclic ether, similar to aliphatic alcohols)
   - **CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O**: -0.13115098 (lactam with aromatic substitution reduces value)
   - **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**: -0.45902843 (complex polycyclic with multiple polar groups reduces value)

3. **Steroids or Polycyclic Structures**:
   - **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** is a simplified steroid-like structure with:
     - Two fused cyclohexane rings.
     - A tertiary alcohol group (similar to **CCCC(C)(C)O** and **CC1CCCO1**).
     - No strongly polar or electronegative groups beyond the alcohol.

### Prediction:
The molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** has:
- A rigid polycyclic framework (like steroids in the examples).
- A tertiary alcohol (similar to **CCCC(C)(C)O**, which has a value of 0.82437759).
- No additional electronegative atoms or strong polar groups that would significantly reduce the value (unlike the more complex polycyclics with ketones or fluorines).

Given the simplicity and the presence of the tertiary alcohol, the property value is likely close to **0.82437759**, similar to other aliphatic alcohols and simple cyclic ethers in the dataset.

### Final Answer:
**0.82437759**

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.14051890822429056
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: This is a notable functional group, similar to the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property value: **0.45902843**). The presence of P(=S) often correlates with moderately positive property values in the given dataset.
2. **Lactam Ring (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: This is a cyclic amide (similar to a phthalimide-like structure), which is also present in the reference molecule above. This group tends to reduce the property value slightly but is offset by the P(=S) group.
3. **Ethoxy Groups (OCC)**: These are electron-donating and bulky, but their effect is secondary compared to the P(=S) and lactam groups.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest match is **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property: **0.45902843**). The only difference is the replacement of **SC(CCl)** with **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**. 
  - The lactam ring (N2C(=O)...) is slightly more polar and less bulky than **SC(CCl)**, which may reduce the property value marginally.
  - However, the core P(=S) and ethoxy groups dominate, so the property should remain in a similar range.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarities, the property value for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is likely slightly lower than **0.45902843** but still positive. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.40** (approximate, likely between 0.35 and 0.45 based on the dataset trends). 

For higher precision, I would note that the replacement of **SC(CCl)** with the lactam ring typically reduces the value by ~0.05–0.10 in similar contexts, so **0.40** is a conservative estimate. 

### Final Answer:
**0.40** (specific predicted value based on structural analogy).

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -0.7962738132709799
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like** or **diazinone** core (two nitrogens and a carbonyl in a 6-membered ring), which is fused to a benzene ring. This is somewhat similar to the following examples:
   - **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property: -1.40518908): This has a benzimidazole-like core with a carbonyl and fused aromatic rings.
   - **O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23** (property: -1.34898152): This has a lactam and fused aromatic rings.

2. **Substituents**: The molecule has:
   - A **methyl group (C)** attached to the diazinone ring.
   - A **phenyl group (c2ccccc2)** attached to one of the nitrogens.
   - A **carbonyl group (=O)** in the ring, which is polar and electron-withdrawing.

3. **Electron-Withdrawing/Delocalization**: The carbonyl and nitrogen atoms create a conjugated system with the phenyl ring, likely leading to a **negative property value** (as seen in similar conjugated, polar structures in the examples).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analogs are the benzimidazole-like and lactam structures with fused aromatic systems, which have property values around **-1.3 to -1.4**.
- The additional methyl groups here may slightly reduce the magnitude of the property (make it less negative), but the core structure dominates.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarities to the examples with values around **-1.3 to -1.4**, and accounting for the slightly less polar nature due to the methyl groups, a reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: -1.25**  

(Note: This is an educated estimate based on structural trends in the data. For precise predictions, computational or empirical methods would be needed.)

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.36534916138315576
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with highly polar groups (e.g., multiple hydroxyls, amines, or carbonyls) tend to have lower (often negative) property values. 
     - Example: `OCC(O)C(O)CO` (glycerol) has a value of **0.71196247**, while `O=C1CCC(=O)N1` (succinimide) has **0.05620756**.
   - Nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., alkanes, alkenes) tend to have higher positive values.
     - Example: `CCC(=C)C` (isoprene) has **0.6182832**, and `CCCCC` (pentane) has **0.8618493**.

2. **Halogen Substitution**:
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, I) increase the property value, especially when multiple are present.
     - Example: `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` (hexachlorobenzene derivative) has **1.03047199**, and `BrC(Cl)Cl` (bromodichloromethane) has **1.85484959**.

3. **Esters and Ethers**:
   - Esters (`C(=O)OR`) and ethers (`ROR`) tend to have intermediate values, often between **0.3 and 0.9**.
     - Example: `CCOC(=O)N` (ethyl carbamate) has **0.17799062**, and `COC=O` (methyl formate) has **0.36534916**.

4. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl) lower the property value.
     - Example: `N#Cc1ccccc1` (phenylacetonitrile) has **-0.34661331**.

### Analysis of **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is **ethyl hexanoate**, an ester with a 6-carbon aliphatic chain and an ethoxy group (`OCC`).
- Esters in the examples (`COC=O`, `CCOC(=O)N`) have values around **0.3–0.4**.
- The longer aliphatic chain (`CCCCC`) suggests a slight increase due to nonpolarity, but the ester group counteracts this.
- No halogens or highly polar groups are present.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, **ethyl hexanoate** likely has a value similar to other esters but slightly higher due to the longer hydrocarbon tail. A reasonable estimate is:  
**0.36534916** (matching `COC=O` and other esters in the examples).

### Final Answer:
**0.36534916**
==================================================
Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.36534916138315554
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and patterns observed in the molecular structures and their corresponding property values, I can predict the property for the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate). 

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic esters** (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 with -0.55270771 and CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 with -0.36534916) tend to have negative property values, typically in the range of -0.3 to -0.6.
2. The presence of an **ester group (COC=O)** attached to an aromatic ring (benzene) is associated with moderately negative values.
3. The molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is structurally similar to **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate), which has a property value of **-0.36534916**. The only difference is the alkyl group (methyl vs. ethyl), which does not drastically alter the property in this context.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (-0.36534916)**, the property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** should be very close, likely slightly less negative due to the shorter alkyl chain (methyl instead of ethyl). 

**Predicted property value: -0.35** (approximate, likely between -0.30 and -0.40). 

However, since the examples show **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** at **-0.36534916**, and methyl vs. ethyl substitution doesn't drastically change the trend, a reasonable estimate is:

**Final predicted value: -0.37** (matching the precision of the given examples). 

Thus, the predicted property for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is:  
**-0.37** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the provided data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on structural analogies and trends in the given data.)

Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.3747170885981085
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values:

### Key Observations:
1. **Hydrocarbons with Conjugation/Double Bonds**:
   - **C=C** (ethylene-like) or conjugated systems tend to have lower (more negative) values compared to saturated hydrocarbons.
   - Example: **C/C=C/C** (butene) has a value of **0.6182832**, while **CCC(C)(C)CC** (saturated hydrocarbon) has a higher value of **0.8618493**.

2. **Conjugated Dienes**:
   - The molecule **C=CCC=C** is a conjugated diene (1,3-butadiene). Conjugation typically lowers the property value compared to isolated double bonds or saturated chains.
   - Comparing to **C/C=C/C** (0.6182832), conjugation in **C=CCC=C** would likely reduce the value further due to increased electron delocalization.

3. **Saturated vs. Unsaturated**:
   - Saturated hydrocarbons (e.g., **C1CCCC1**, **CCC(C)(C)CC**) have higher values (~0.8-0.9).
   - Unsaturated or conjugated systems have lower values (e.g., **C=Cc1ccccc1** is -0.11241513).

### Prediction:
Given that **C=CCC=C** is a conjugated diene, its value should be lower than **C/C=C/C** (0.6182832) but higher than highly polar or functionalized molecules with very negative values. A reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than **C/C=C/C**, but still positive due to its hydrocarbon nature.

**Predicted property value for C=CCC=C: ~0.4**  
(Exact prediction: **0.4**, considering conjugation reduces the value but not as drastically as polar functional groups.)  

---
**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value for **C=CCC=C** is **0.4**.  

*(Note: This is an educated estimate based on the provided examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or experimental data would be required.)*

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 2.21083082272884
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends related to halogenated compounds, particularly those with multiple heavy halogens (Br, Cl, etc.).

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds with Multiple Heavy Halogens**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): Property = **1.30214188**
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (a bromo-chloro-fluoro compound): Property = **1.38645323**
   - **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a trichlorinated phosphate derivative): Property = **1.77990617**
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (a heavily chlorinated biphenyl): Property = **0.7588021**

   These compounds have high property values (all > 0.75), suggesting that multiple heavy halogens (Cl, Br) increase the property value significantly.

2. **Brominated vs. Chlorinated Compounds**:
   - Bromine is heavier and more polarizable than chlorine, so brominated compounds might have slightly higher property values than chlorinated ones (e.g., **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** = 1.386 vs. hexachlorobiphenyl = 1.302).

3. **Tribromomethane (BrC(Br)Br)**:
   - This is a simple, symmetric molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon. 
   - Compared to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (property = 1.386), tribromomethane has three bromines instead of a mix of F, Cl, and Br. Bromine is more polarizable than chlorine or fluorine, so we expect a higher value.
   - Compared to **C(Cl)(Cl)(Cl)** (not explicitly in the examples, but similar to the trichlorinated fragment in **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** = 1.779), replacing Cl with Br would likely increase the value further.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Multiple heavy halogens (Br) lead to high property values (> 1.3).
- Bromine contributes more than chlorine.
- Symmetric trihalogenated compounds (like **BrC(Br)Br**) have high values.

A reasonable estimate for **BrC(Br)Br** is **~1.6 to 1.8**. Splitting the difference between **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (1.386) and **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (1.779), we can predict:

**Predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br: 1.65** (approximate, likely between 1.6 and 1.8). 

For specificity, I'll predict: **1.68**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the apparent trend of halogenation increasing the value.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.4590284335326828
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Polar/Functional Groups**: 
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -N, -S=O) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.14051891 for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**).
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, F, I) often increase the property value (e.g., **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** has 1.70496275).
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -NO2, -C=O) lower the property value.

2. **Nonpolar/Hydrophobic Groups**:
   - Aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC**) or nonpolar groups (e.g., **C**) tend to have higher positive values (e.g., 0.8618493 for **C**).

3. **Hybrid Cases**:
   - Molecules with both polar and nonpolar regions (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**) have intermediate values (0.76817003 in this case).

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
The molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** has:
1. **Polar/Functional Groups**:
   - A thiophosphate group **P(=S)(OCC)** (similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**, which has 0.76817003).
   - A chloroalkyl group **C(CCl)** (similar to **CCC(C)Cl**, which has 1.13351919).
   - A lactam ring **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (similar to **CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O**, which has -0.44029258).

2. **Aromatic Ring**:
   - A benzene ring (similar to **c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2**, which has -0.63701905).

3. **Overall Polarity**:
   - The molecule is moderately polar due to the thiophosphate, lactam, and chloroalkyl groups, but also has nonpolar ethyl groups (**OCC**).

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 0.76817003), which also has a thiophosphate group, a polar amide, and a chloro-substituted aromatic ring. 
- The given molecule has an additional lactam ring (more polar) and lacks an aromatic Cl, but the thiophosphate and chloroalkyl groups are dominant.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of polar (thiophosphate, lactam) and nonpolar (ethyl, chloroalkyl) groups, the property value should be **slightly lower than 0.76817003** but still positive. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property: 0.65**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the examples. For precise predictions, computational methods or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -1.2740381012335682
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Amide group (`C(=O)N`)**: Present in the molecule (similar to `CN(C)C(=O)C` and `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` in the examples).  
   - `CN(C)C(=O)C` has a value of **0.36534916**.  
   - `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` has a value of **0.17799062**.  
   The additional bulkiness and substitution here may lower the value slightly.

2. **Aromatic ring with chlorine substitution (`c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)`)**:
   - Chlorinated aromatics like `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` have values around **-0.15925476**.  
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has a high value (**1.21783054**) due to multiple chlorines, but this molecule has only one chlorine, so the effect is less pronounced.

3. **Heterocyclic group (`n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C`)**:
   - This resembles nitro or electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `N(=O)=O`), which tend to decrease the property value (e.g., `Nc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has **-0.6182832**).  
   - The presence of a bulky tert-butyl group (`C(C)(C)C`) may slightly offset this effect.

4. **Overall polarity and bulkiness**:
   - The molecule is polar due to the amide and heterocycle but also has bulky substituents (tert-butyl, aromatic chlorine).  
   - Bulky nonpolar groups (like `C(C)(C)C`) can increase the value (e.g., `CCC(C)C` has **0.8618493**), but the polar/electron-withdrawing groups counteract this.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (**0.17799062**) is a simpler amide with less polarity/bulk.  
- `Nc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (**-0.6182832**) has strong electron-withdrawing effects.  
- `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (**-0.15925476**) combines chlorine and nitro groups.  

This molecule is intermediate in complexity: it has an amide, a chlorine, and a heterocycle with a tert-butyl group. The net effect is likely a slightly negative value but not as extreme as strongly electron-withdrawing nitro groups.

### Predicted Value:
Considering the balance of polar/electron-withdrawing groups and bulky nonpolar substituents, the predicted property value is:  
**-0.35** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar examples).  

### Refined Estimate:
Given the closest analogs (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` at **0.17799062** and `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` at **-0.15925476**), and accounting for the additional heterocycle and tert-butyl group, the value is likely slightly more negative than `-0.15925476` but less extreme than `-0.6182832`.  

**Final Prediction: -0.25** (specific value interpolated from trends).  

However, reviewing the examples again, molecules with combined amide + halogen + heterocycle (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O` at **-0.13115098**) suggest a less negative value. Adjusting for the tert-butyl group's offsetting effect:  

**Adjusted Prediction: -0.18** (closer to `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` but slightly lower due to chlorine/heterocycle).  

Given the variability, the most reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.20** (specific property value).  

---
**Answer:** The predicted property value for **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C** is **-0.20**.

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: -0.15925476265419536
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of Halogens (Cl, Br, I)**:
   - Molecules with multiple halogens (especially Cl or Br) tend to have higher property values (more positive). 
     - Example: **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** has a value of **1.03047199** (4 Cl atoms).
     - **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C#N** has a value of **1.19909468** (3 Cl atoms).
     - **ICI** has a value of **2.22956668** (I and Cl).
     - **BrC(Br)Br** has a value of **2.21083082** (3 Br atoms).
   - A single Cl or Br often increases the value but not as dramatically (e.g., **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** has **0.48713222**).

2. **Presence of Oxygen (O) in Hydroxyl or Ether Groups**:
   - Oxygen atoms (especially in hydroxyl groups) tend to decrease the property value (more negative).
     - Example: **OCC(O)C(O)CO** has **0.71196247**, but this is likely due to the lack of halogens.
     - **COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1** has **-0.92742479** (multiple OH groups).
     - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)C** has **-0.44029258**.

3. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Aromatic rings alone (without halogens or strong electron-withdrawing groups) tend to have values around **-0.05 to 0.13**.
     - Example: **CCCc1ccccc1** has **0.13115098**.
     - **Cc1ccccc1N** has **-0.05620756**.

4. **Combined Effects**:
   - When halogens and oxygen-containing groups are both present, the property value seems to balance between the two effects. For example:
     - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** has **0.48713222** (2 Cl, 1 O).
     - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** has **1.03047199** (4 Cl, 1 O).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**:
- It has **3 Cl atoms** (one on each aromatic ring and an extra one on the second ring).
- It has **2 O atoms** (both in ether linkages, not hydroxyls).
- It is a **diphenyl ether** structure with chlorine substitutions.

Given the examples:
- The presence of 3 Cl atoms would push the value higher (similar to **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**, which has 4 Cl and a value of **1.03047199**).
- The 2 O atoms (ether linkages) would slightly reduce the value compared to a purely halogenated molecule.
- The diphenyl ether structure is somewhat similar to **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2**, which has **-0.05620756**, but with more Cl and O.

### Prediction:
Given the strong influence of the 3 Cl atoms, the value should be **positive and moderately high**, but not as high as molecules with 3 or 4 halogens in close proximity (like **BrC(Br)Br** or **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C#N**). The ether oxygens will slightly reduce the value.

A reasonable estimate is between **0.6 and 0.8**, closer to **0.7** based on the examples.

### Final Predicted Value:
**0.70** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

For more precision, I would compare it most closely to **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (1.03047199)** but with one fewer Cl and an extra O, so slightly lower. Thus, **~0.75** is also plausible. 

However, given the examples, I'll settle on:
**0.70** (likely in the range of 0.65 to 0.75). 

If forced to pick a specific value from the trends, I'd predict:
**0.724** (interpolating between similar molecules). 

But since the examples don't provide an exact match, the closest estimate is:
**0.70**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based purely on the numerical trends in the given data.)

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.6182831961868789
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property value for the molecule **CC/C=C\C** (which is equivalent to **CC=CC** or but-2-ene) can be inferred by comparing it to similar structures in the dataset.

1. **CC/C=C/C** (but-2-ene, same as CC/C=C\C but with different stereochemistry) has a property value of **0.6182832**.
2. **CC=CC** (same molecule, no stereochemistry specified) would logically have the same or a very similar value, as stereochemistry does not appear to drastically affect the property in other cases (e.g., cyclic vs. linear structures with similar functional groups have consistent trends).

Since **CC/C=C/C** is already in the dataset with a value of **0.6182832**, and **CC/C=C\C** is its stereoisomer, the property value should be very close. No other examples suggest that stereochemistry (cis/trans) significantly alters the property for simple alkenes.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CC/C=C\C** is:
**0.6182832** (same as the given trans/cis example). 

(Note: If the property were highly sensitive to stereochemistry, we might expect a slight difference, but the dataset does not provide evidence for this. For instance, other small alkenes or similar structures do not show such variations.)
==================================================
Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 0.8243775949158385
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOCC** (1,2-diethoxyethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - Molecules with ether linkages tend to have moderate property values, often in the range of **0.3 to 0.8**. For example:
     - `CC(C)COC(=O)C` has a value of **0.36534916**.
     - `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` has a value of **-0.36534916** (note the presence of an aromatic ester, which may lower the value).
   - The ether group itself does not drastically increase or decrease the property value unless combined with other polar or bulky groups.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Linear alkanes or ethers (e.g., `CCC(O)CC`, `CC(C)O`) often have values around **0.8**.
   - Branching or additional functional groups can modify this value.

3. **CCCOCC Structure**:
   - This is a symmetrical ether with two ethyl groups (`CCOCC`). It is structurally similar to `CCC(O)CC` (3-pentanol), which has a value of **0.82437759**, but without the hydroxyl group.
   - The absence of a highly polar group (like -OH) and the presence of the ether linkage suggest a slightly lower value than `CCC(O)CC` but still in the same ballpark.

4. **Comparison to Other Ethers**:
   - `CC(C)COC(=O)C` (an ester-ether) has **0.36534916**, but this is influenced by the carbonyl group.
   - `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` (an aromatic ester) has **-0.36534916**, but this is due to the aromatic ring and ester combination.
   - Pure aliphatic ethers like `CCCOCC` are likely closer to **0.6-0.8**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, **CCCOCC** is most similar to linear ethers/alcohols with values around **0.8**, but slightly lower due to the lack of a polar hydroxyl group. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.6182832**  
*(This matches the value of `CCCCCCC=C` in the examples, which is a similar-sized hydrocarbon with modest polarity. The ether oxygen in `CCCOCC` likely has a comparable effect on the property as the double bond in `CCCCCCC=C`.)*

### Final Answer:
**0.6182832**
==================================================
Iteration: 44
SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -1.2834060284485203
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary amide** group (`N(C=O)`), which is polar and can contribute to negative property values (as seen in similar amide-containing molecules in the examples).
   - It has two **phenyl rings** (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`), which are hydrophobic but can also participate in π-stacking or polar interactions depending on substituents.
   - The **tert-butyl-like group** (`C(C)(C)`) attached to the amide nitrogen adds steric bulk and hydrophobicity.

2. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = -0.59954734): This is a simple hydrophobic molecule with two phenyl rings and an aliphatic linker. The property is moderately negative due to hydrophobicity.
   - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property = -1.38645323): This has a polar amide, a phenyl ring, and a heterocyclic group. The highly negative value is likely due to the polar amide and additional heteroatoms.
   - **Nc1cccc2ccccc12** (property = -0.54333978): This has a fused aromatic system with an amino group, contributing to a moderately negative value.
   - **CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1** (property = -0.55270771): This has an amide and an ether-linked phenyl ring, similar in polarity to our target molecule.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of the **amide group** and **two phenyl rings** suggests a moderately negative property value, similar to the examples above.
   - The **tert-butyl-like group** adds hydrophobicity but does not drastically change the polarity compared to the examples.
   - The molecule lacks strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro or halogens) that would make the property more negative.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to molecules with property values around **-0.5 to -0.6**, and considering the balance between the polar amide and hydrophobic phenyl/tert-butyl groups, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.58**  

This aligns with the trend observed for similar amide-containing aromatic compounds in the provided examples.

Iteration: 45
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.08431134493457446
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a substituted benzene ring (**c1ccc(Br)cc1**) with an acetamido group (**CC(=O)N-**) attached. This is similar to **Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (property = -0.36534916) and **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property = 0.39345294), but with an acetamido group instead of a formyl or hydroxyl group.
2. **Substituents**:
   - The **Br** substituent is electron-withdrawing and tends to increase the property value (e.g., **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** has a value of 0.515236, and **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** has 0.39345294).
   - The **CC(=O)N-** group is polar and electron-withdrawing due to the carbonyl (C=O) and amide (N) moieties. This is somewhat similar to **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = -1.28340603), but less complex.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**: Property = 0.39345294 (Br and OH substituents).
- **Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1**: Property = -0.36534916 (formyl and OH substituents).
- **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: Property = -1.28340603 (complex amide).
- **Cc1ccc(N)cc1**: Property = -0.05620756 (methyl and amino substituents).

The acetamido group (**CC(=O)N-**) is more electron-withdrawing than a simple amino group (**NH2**) but less so than a nitro group (**NO2**). The Br substituent adds a positive contribution to the property value.

### Estimated Property:
Given the competing effects of the electron-withdrawing Br and the polar but moderately electron-withdrawing acetamido group, the property value is likely slightly negative but not as extreme as molecules with strong electron-withdrawing groups like nitro or complex amides.

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.3 and -0.5**, closer to **-0.4**.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1: -0.42**
==================================================
Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.13115098100933803
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Benzene Rings (Aromatic Systems)**:
   - Molecules with a simple benzene ring (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1N**, **C=Cc1ccccc1**) tend to have property values around **-0.05 to -0.11**.
   - Substitutions on the benzene ring can modulate the value:
     - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., **N(=O)=O**, **Br**) tend to increase the value (e.g., **Brc1ccccc1** has **0.58081149**).
     - Alkyl groups (e.g., **CCc1ccc(C)cc1**) give values around **0.13**.

2. **Alkyl Groups**:
   - Branched alkyl chains (e.g., **CC(C)CO**, **CC(C)CCO**) consistently have a value of **0.82437759**.
   - Linear alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCCCC#C**) have lower values (e.g., **0.44966051**).

3. **Combined Alkyl-Aromatic Systems**:
   - **CCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene) has a value of **0.13115098**.
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyl-substituted toluene) has the same value (**0.13115098**), suggesting that branching on the alkyl group attached to the benzene ring doesn't significantly change the property.

4. **Target Molecule: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**:
   - This is **isobutylbenzene**, where an isobutyl group (**CC(C)C-**) is attached to a benzene ring.
   - The isobutyl group is branched, similar to **CC(C)CCO** (which has **0.82437759**), but the presence of the benzene ring will likely reduce the value toward the aromatic range.
   - Comparing to **CCc1ccccc1** (**0.13115098**) and **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (**0.13115098**), the additional carbon in the isobutyl group might slightly increase the value, but the effect is likely small.

### Prediction:
Given the examples, the property value for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is most consistent with the values observed for alkyl-substituted benzenes, particularly **CCc1ccccc1** and **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1**, which both have **0.13115098**. The branching in the isobutyl group is unlikely to significantly alter this value.

### Final Answer:
**0.13115098**
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.1779906170841014
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of a carbonyl group (C=O)**:
   - **Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1** (carbonyl in a heterocycle): 0.14051891
   - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (ketone): 0.06557549
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): -0.55270771
   - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (imide): -1.59254763
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** (aldehyde) is most similar to these, especially the ketone and amide examples.

2. **Aromatic rings**:
   - Simple aromatic rings with no polar groups (e.g., **Cc1cccc2c(C)cccc12**): ~ -0.355
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O**): ~ -0.993
   - Aromatic rings with carbonyls (e.g., **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O**): -0.552

3. **Benzaldehyde-like structures**:
   - The closest example is **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): -0.55270771. The aldehyde (**O=Cc1ccccc1**) is simpler, lacking the amide and phenol, but has a similar electron-withdrawing carbonyl directly attached to the ring.

4. **Trend for aldehydes/ketones**:
   - Ketones/aldehydes without additional polar groups tend to have property values in the range of **0.0 to -0.6**, depending on conjugation and other substituents.

### Prediction:
- The aldehyde group in **O=Cc1ccccc1** is electron-withdrawing and conjugated with the aromatic ring, similar to **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** but without the additional phenol and amide groups. This would likely place its property value between the simple ketone (**0.06557549**) and the amide+phenol (**-0.55270771**).
- A reasonable estimate is **~ -0.3 to -0.4**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **O=Cc1ccccc1** is **-0.35**.

Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -1.6768589714765347
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Observations:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:  
   - The nitro group is present in the aromatic ring (attached to the furan-like moiety).  
   - In the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative property values (e.g., `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` has a value of **-0.80564174**).  

2. **Diketopiperazine-like Core (O=C2CN(N=...)C(=O)N2)**:  
   - This is a cyclic diamide structure with hydrogen-bonding capability.  
   - Similar cyclic amides or imides in the examples (e.g., `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2` with **-0.28103782**) also contribute to negative values.  

3. **Aromatic System with Heteroatoms**:  
   - The molecule contains a furan-like ring (oxygen heterocycle) and an aromatic nitro group, which are polar and likely to reduce the property value.  

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:  
   - The nitro group's presence and the cyclic diamide suggest a value more negative than simple aromatic systems (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1` has **0.40282087**) but less negative than highly polar or polyfunctionalized systems (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has **-1.28340603**).  
   - The closest analog might be `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2` (**-0.28103782**), but with the added nitro group, the value should be more negative.  

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the combined effects of the nitro group, cyclic diamide, and aromatic system, the predicted value is likely in the range of **-0.6 to -0.8**.  

**Final Prediction: -0.718** (a midpoint estimate considering the structural influences).  

This aligns with the trend that nitro groups and polar cyclic structures reduce the property value, while the absence of long alkyl chains or halogens (which increase the value) keeps it moderately negative.

Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.9742644303550811
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **-0.05620756**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene-like structure) has a property value of **-0.97426443**.
   - The presence of additional aromatic rings or nitrogen substitutions tends to decrease the property value (make it more negative).

2. **Symmetry and Conjugation**:
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but with a single bond between the nitrogens instead of a double bond. This suggests less conjugation but similar symmetry.
   - The absence of the double bond (N=N) likely reduces the electron delocalization, which may make the property less negative than the azobenzene-like structure.

3. **Comparison to Other Examples**:
   - The molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3c2ccc4c5ccccc5ccc43** (a large polyaromatic system) has a very negative value (**-1.81737788**), indicating that larger conjugated systems tend to have more negative properties.
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is smaller and less conjugated than this, so its property should be less negative.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) is **-0.05620756**,
- **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (azobenzene-like) is **-0.97426443**,
- The target molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is intermediate in conjugation between these two,

a reasonable estimate would be closer to the azobenzene-like structure but slightly less negative due to the reduced conjugation (single bond between nitrogens). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is approximately:
**-0.75** (interpolating between -0.056 and -0.974). 

However, looking at the exact examples, the closest analog is **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** at **-0.97426443**, and the single-bonded version would likely be slightly less negative. A more precise estimate might be around **-0.7 to -0.8**. 

Given the data, I'll predict:
**-0.80** (a compromise between the aniline and azobenzene-like values). 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is **-0.80**.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -0.4402925791027773
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure (cyclopentane, **CCCC1**). The presence of multiple polar amide groups suggests increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, which typically correlates with lower (more negative) property values in the given examples.
   
2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** has a property value of **-0.44029258**. This molecule also contains multiple amide groups and a cyclic structure, though it is slightly larger (7-membered ring with substitutions).
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** has a property value of **-0.31850953**. This is a smaller cyclic diamide structure, similar to the target molecule but with less ring strain and substitutions.
   - **O=C1CCCN1** (a simple cyclic amide, lactam) has a property value of **0.36534916**, but it lacks the second amide group and has less polarity.

3. **Ring Strain and Symmetry**: The target molecule is a bicyclic diamide (imidazolidine-2,4-dione derivative) with a 5-membered ring fused to a cyclopentane. This introduces some ring strain and symmetry, which may slightly lower the property value compared to less strained analogs.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of two amide groups, cyclic structure, and moderate polarity, the property value is expected to be in the range of **-0.4 to -0.6**. A reasonable estimate, considering the similarity to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (-0.440) but with slightly less substitution, is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.45**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural trends in the examples. For precise predictions, computational tools or QSAR models would be necessary.)

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.2154623259439123
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl (1,4-dichlorobenzene)**: Property value = **0.67449076**
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (a heavily chlorinated biphenyl derivative)**: Property value = **0.7588021**
   - **Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene)**: Not explicitly given, but similar compounds with fewer chlorines tend to have lower values than heavily chlorinated ones.

2. **Trends**:
   - Increasing the number of chlorine atoms on aromatic rings tends to **increase the property value** (e.g., 0.674 for dichlorobenzene → 0.759 for a more chlorinated biphenyl).
   - Symmetry and conjugation (e.g., biphenyl systems) also seem to contribute to higher values.

3. **Target Molecule**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is a **dichlorinated biphenyl** (specifically, 3,3'-dichlorobiphenyl with additional chlorines at the 2 and 5 positions of one ring). It has:
     - Two aromatic rings.
     - Four chlorine atoms (two on each ring, positioned ortho and para to the biphenyl linkage).
     - More chlorination than 1,4-dichlorobenzene but less than the heavily chlorinated example (Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl).

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- The property value for **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** should be **higher than 0.67449076 (dichlorobenzene)** but **lower than 0.7588021 (heavily chlorinated biphenyl)**.
- The additional chlorines and biphenyl structure suggest a value closer to the higher end.

### Final Prediction:
**0.72** (interpolated based on the examples). 

However, looking more closely at the heavily chlorinated biphenyl example (0.758), this molecule is slightly less chlorinated, so a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.71**  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an interpolation based on the given examples. If higher precision is needed, additional data points would help.)*

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.13115098100933803
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Aromatic Rings**:
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (heptylbenzene): Property value = **0.13115098**
   - **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine): Property value = **0.06557549**
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline): Property value = **-0.05620756**
   - **C=CC=O** (acrolein): Property value = **0.3091416**
   - **CCCC(=O)CC** (2-hexanone): Property value = **0.55270771**

   Hydrocarbons with simple alkyl chains and aromatic rings tend to have **positive property values**, typically in the range of **0.1 to 0.6**. The presence of polar or electronegative groups (e.g., N, O, S) tends to reduce the property value.

2. **Diethylbenzene (CCc1ccc(CC)cc1)**:
   - This is a purely hydrocarbon molecule with two ethyl groups attached to a benzene ring.
   - It is structurally similar to **heptylbenzene (CCCCCCc1ccccc1)**, which has a property value of **0.13115098**.
   - Diethylbenzene has slightly less alkyl character than heptylbenzene (two ethyl groups vs. one heptyl group), so its property value might be slightly lower but still in the same range.

3. **Comparison with Other Aromatics**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline, with a nitrogen substituent) has a lower value (**-0.05620756**) due to the polar N group.
   - Since diethylbenzene has no polar groups, its value should be higher than methylaniline but comparable to heptylbenzene.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, **diethylbenzene (CCc1ccc(CC)cc1)** is expected to have a property value close to **heptylbenzene (0.13115098)** but slightly lower due to fewer alkyl carbons. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.10**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. If more context were provided, a more precise prediction could be made.)

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -0.14051890822429056
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a **para-substituted benzene ring** with:
   - An **amino group (-NH2)** at position 1.
   - A **sulfonamide group (-S(N)(=O)=O)** at position 4.

2. **Key Functional Groups**:
   - The **amino group (-NH2)** is electron-donating and often associated with negative property values (e.g., in the examples, molecules with -NH2 tend to have negative values).
   - The **sulfonamide group (-S(N)(=O)=O)** is polar and electron-withdrawing due to the sulfonyl (=O) groups. This can introduce some positive contribution but is often balanced by the amino group.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (property = -0.6182832): This is very similar to our molecule but has a nitro group (-NO2) instead of the sulfonamide. The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, yet the property is moderately negative due to the amino group.
   - **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12** (property = -0.68385869): This is a purine-like structure with multiple nitrogens, showing a negative value.
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)I** (implicit in the examples, e.g., c1c(NC(=O)c2ccccc2(I))cccc1, property = -0.4121888): Aromatic amines with electron-withdrawing substituents tend to have negative values.

4. **Sulfonamide vs. Nitro**:
   - The sulfonamide group is less electron-withdrawing than a nitro group but still polar. Thus, the property value for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** should be slightly less negative than **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (-0.6182832) but still in the same range.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is likely slightly less negative than -0.6182832. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: -0.55**  

This balances the electron-donating effect of the amino group with the electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonamide.

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: -1.0866795569345133
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34`, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings. It appears to be a **tetracene** derivative or a similar linearly fused aromatic system. 

### Key Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Multiple Fused Rings**:
   - `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` (property: -1.33024566)
   - `Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32` (property: -0.84311345)
   - `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` (property: -1.57381177)
   - These are all multi-ring aromatic systems, and their property values are negative, ranging from -0.84 to -1.57.

2. **Linear vs. Angular Fused Rings**:
   - The molecule in question (`c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34`) is a **linear tetracene-like structure**, which is more conjugated than angular fused systems (like phenanthrene derivatives). Increased conjugation often correlates with more negative property values in the given examples.

3. **Comparison to Closest Example**:
   - The molecule `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` (property: -1.57381177) is a 5-ring system with some angular fusion, and its property is quite negative.
   - The molecule `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` (property: -1.33024566) is a 4-ring system with angular fusion.
   - Our molecule is a 4-ring linear system, so its property should be between these two, likely closer to the more conjugated (linear) example.

### Predicted Property:
Given the linear conjugation and similarity to the examples with negative values, the predicted property for `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34` is approximately:

**-1.45** (interpolated between -1.33 and -1.57, leaning toward the more negative end due to linear conjugation). 

### Note:
This is an educated guess based on the trend in the provided data, where larger/more conjugated aromatic systems tend to have more negative property values. The exact value may depend on finer structural details not explicitly accounted for here.

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: -1.8454816613456833
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - Multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) attached to aromatic rings (phenolic groups).
   - A carbonyl group (C=O) in a cyclic structure.
   - An ether linkage (C-O-C) connecting two aromatic systems.
   - Extended conjugation due to aromatic rings and the carbonyl group.

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - The presence of multiple -OH groups suggests high polarity and strong hydrogen-bonding capacity, which typically lowers the property value (as seen in similar molecules in the examples).

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple -OH groups (e.g., **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, property = -0.9555) tend to have negative property values.
   - The carbonyl group and aromatic conjugation further contribute to lowering the value (similar to **Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4**, property = -2.2015).
   - The molecule resembles flavonoids or polyphenols, which are highly polar and conjugated, leading to more negative values.

4. **Specific Observations**:
   - The molecule has more -OH groups than most examples, suggesting a stronger effect.
   - The presence of a carbonyl group in a conjugated system (like in some of the more negative examples) further lowers the value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above analysis and comparing to similar molecules in the dataset, the predicted property value for **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3** is:

**-1.85**  

### Rationale:
- This is between the values for **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** (-0.9555) and **Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4** (-2.2015), reflecting the increased polarity and conjugation in this molecule.
- The additional -OH groups and the carbonyl group in a conjugated system push the value further negative than simpler phenolic systems.

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 0.8712172309906021
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., P=O, P=S)**:
   - Molecules with phosphate/thiophosphate groups (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) tend to have **higher positive values** (e.g., 1.29277396).
   - The presence of `P=O` or `P=S` often increases the property value, especially when combined with halogens or other electronegative groups.

2. **Amide groups (NC=O)**:
   - Amides (e.g., `NC(=O)c1cccnc1`) tend to have **negative values** (e.g., -0.43092465).
   - The `NC(C)=O` fragment in the target molecule suggests a slight reduction in the property.

3. **Thioether (S-C)**:
   - Thioether groups (e.g., `Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1`) contribute moderately positive values (e.g., 0.14051891).

4. **Combined effects**:
   - The molecule has both a phosphate (`P=O`) and an amide (`NC(C)=O`), which may partially offset each other.
   - The `SC` group adds a small positive contribution.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a high value (1.29277396) due to `P=S` and multiple chlorines.
- `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of 0.92742479 (less than the `P=S` analog but still high due to `P=O` and chlorines).
- `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` has a value of 1.22719847 (similar to the target molecule but with a larger alkyl chain and `P=S`).

### Prediction:
The target molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** has:
- A `P=O` group (positive contribution, but less than `P=S`).
- An amide `NC(C)=O` (negative contribution).
- A thioether `SC` (small positive contribution).

Given these competing effects, the property value should be **moderately positive but lower than the phosphorus-containing examples with halogens**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.75** (approximate, based on balancing the contributions of `P=O`, `NC(C)=O`, and `SC`). 

This is slightly lower than `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (0.92742479) due to the absence of chlorines and the presence of the amide.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 1.1616229746541362
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes**: 
   - **CC1CCCC1** (cyclohexane) and **CCCC(C)C** (branched alkane) have high positive values (~0.86). 
   - **CCCC(=C)C** (branched alkene) has a slightly lower value (~0.62). 
   - This suggests that saturation and branching contribute to higher property values.

2. **Chlorinated Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a very high value (~1.03), likely due to multiple chlorines and aromaticity.
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (dichlorophenol) has a moderate positive value (~0.49).
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (chloroaniline) has a lower positive value (~0.22).
   - This suggests that chlorination tends to increase the property value, but the effect is modulated by other functional groups.

3. **Small Halogenated Molecules**:
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane) has a very high value (~1.31), indicating that simple halogenation (Br) strongly increases the property.
   - **CCCCBr** (bromobutane) also has the same high value (~1.31), reinforcing the trend for brominated alkanes.

4. **Alkenes with Halogens**:
   - The given examples do not include simple chloroalkenes, but **Cl\C=C/Cl** is a small, symmetric molecule with two chlorines. Given that chlorination generally increases the property and small alkenes have intermediate values, we can interpolate.

### Prediction for **Cl\C=C/Cl**:
- The molecule is a small, symmetric dichloroalkene. 
- Compared to **CCBr** (~1.31) and **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (~0.49), **Cl\C=C/Cl** is less halogenated than the former but simpler than the latter. 
- The presence of two chlorines and a double bond suggests a value between the highly brominated **CCBr** and the moderately chlorinated aromatic **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**.
- A reasonable estimate is **~0.75**, considering the trends.

However, looking more closely, **Cl\C=C/Cl** is structurally similar to **CCCC(=C)C** (a branched alkene with value ~0.62) but with two chlorines replacing hydrogens. Since chlorination increases the property, we can adjust upward from 0.62. 

Given that **CCBr** (single Br) is ~1.31 and **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (two Cl + aromatic) is ~0.49, a symmetric dichloroalkene would likely be higher than the aromatic but lower than the brominated alkane. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **Cl\C=C/Cl** is:  
**0.85** (approximating based on the trends). 

However, reviewing the examples again, **CC1CCCC1** (cyclohexane) is ~0.86, and **Cl\C=C/Cl** is less saturated but with two electronegative chlorines, which might balance out to a similar value. 

Final prediction: **0.86** (same as cyclohexane, as the chlorines and double bond may offset each other's effects). 

But given that **CCCCBr** is 1.31 and **Cl\C=C/Cl** is smaller and less halogenated, a more precise estimate is **0.75**. 

After reconsideration, the most consistent value based on the examples is:  
**0.75**. 

However, the exact value isn't perfectly deducible from the given examples, so this is an approximate interpolation. 

### Final Answer:  
Predicted property value for **Cl\C=C/Cl**: **0.75**.

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 0.06557549050466902
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Heteroatoms**:
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1**: -1.23656639 (complex aromatic with N and O)
   - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23**: -0.97426443 (polycyclic aromatic with multiple N)
   - **COc5cc4OCC3Oc2c1CC(Oc1ccc2C(=O)C3c4cc5OC)C(C)=C**: -2.08904777 (complex polycyclic with O)
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2**: -0.80564174 (aromatic with multiple N and O)
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43**: -1.57381177 (polycyclic aromatic, no heteroatoms)
   - **c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1**: -1.33024566 (polycyclic aromatic, no heteroatoms)
   - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12**: -0.6182832 (aromatic with multiple N)

2. **Simple Aromatic Systems**:
   - **CNc1ccccc1**: -0.05620756 (aniline derivative)
   - **CCNc1ccccc1**: -0.05620756 (aniline derivative)
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1Cl)c2ccccc2**: -0.05620756 (chlorinated biphenyl)
   - **Cc1ccc(O)cc1C**: -0.05620756 (methyl-substituted phenol)

3. **Pyridine-Like Structures**:
   - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23**: -0.97426443 (polycyclic with N, but more complex than pyridine)
   - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12**: -0.6182832 (aromatic with multiple N, similar to pyridine but fused rings)

### Analysis for **c1ccncc1** (Pyridine):
- Pyridine is a simple 6-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen. It is less complex than the polycyclic or multi-heteroatom examples but more polarizable than benzene due to the nitrogen.
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - **CNc1ccccc1** (aniline): -0.05620756 (N attached to benzene, less aromatic N contribution).
  - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12**: -0.6182832 (more N atoms, but pyridine is simpler).
  - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23**: -0.97426443 (more complex, but pyridine is a subunit).

Given that pyridine is aromatic with one nitrogen and no additional functional groups, its property value should be between the simple aromatic systems (like aniline, ~-0.056) and the more nitrogen-rich or polycyclic systems (~-0.6 to -1.0). 

### Predicted Property for **c1ccncc1**:
A reasonable estimate is **-0.35**, reflecting its intermediate nature between simple aromatics and nitrogen-rich systems.

**Final Answer**: -0.35

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: -1.639387262616723
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Polar functional groups**: 
   - Multiple hydroxyl groups (`OCC(O)CO-`) suggest increased polarity (similar to polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`, which has a value of **0.637**).
   - An ester (`COC(=O)-`) and an aromatic amide (`Nc2ccnc3...`) introduce additional polarity and potential hydrogen bonding (similar to esters/amides in the examples, e.g., `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` at **-0.862**).

2. **Aromatic systems**: 
   - The molecule contains two fused aromatic rings (`naphthalene-like` core: `c2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23`), which are present in other examples (e.g., `c1ccc2cnccc2c1` at **-0.422** or `c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3` at **-0.909**). Fused aromatics tend to lower the property value.

3. **Electron-withdrawing groups**: 
   - A chlorine substituent (`Cl`) on the aromatic ring (similar to `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` at **1.087** or `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)...` at **0.759**) can increase the value, but its effect is modulated by the aromatic system's complexity.

4. **Hybridization**: 
   - The presence of sp²-hybridized atoms (aromatics) and polar groups balances the property value between positive and negative trends.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- The closest analogs are:
  - Polyols + aromatic systems: `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (**0.637**) and `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (**0.674**).
  - Aromatic esters/amides: `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` (**-0.862**) and `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` (**-1.283**).
  - Fused aromatics: `c1cc2ccc3cccc4ccc(c1)c2c34` (**-1.087**).

### Prediction:
Given the combination of polar groups (hydroxyl, ester, amide) and a fused aromatic system with a chlorine substituent, the property value is likely **negative but not extremely low**. The polyol component may partially offset the aromatic/amide contribution. 

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.6 and -0.8**, closer to the ester/amide examples. 

**Predicted value: -0.72** (approximating based on structural balance). 

*Note: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical interpolation from the given examples.*

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 0.8243775949158385
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains with Polar Groups**:
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): 0.13115098  
   - **CCCCCCCI** (1-iodohexane): 1.54570799  
   - **CCC(C)Cl** (2-chlorobutane): 1.13351919  
   - **CCOC=O** (ethyl formate): 0.36534916  
   - **COC=O** (methyl formate): 0.36534916  
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tert-amyl alcohol): 0.82437759  
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cyclooctanol): 0.82437759  

   These examples suggest that:
   - Non-polar hydrocarbons (e.g., propylbenzene) have values close to 0.13.  
   - Introducing polar groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -I) increases the property value, with heavier halogens (I > Cl) giving higher values.  
   - Alcohols (e.g., tert-amyl alcohol, cyclooctanol) have values around 0.82.  

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - Alcohols (**-OH**) tend to have positive values (~0.82 for tert-amyl alcohol and cyclooctanol).  
   - Esters (**-COO-** or **-OC=O**) have values around 0.36.  

3. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer chains or branching don't drastically change the property if the functional group is the same (e.g., tert-amyl alcohol and cyclooctanol both have ~0.82).  

### Prediction for **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol):
- This is a linear alcohol (similar to tert-amyl alcohol and cyclooctanol but with a primary -OH group).  
- Primary alcohols might have slightly lower values than tertiary or cyclic alcohols due to less steric hindrance or electronic effects, but the examples don't show a clear trend for this.  
- Given that alcohols in the examples cluster around **0.82**, and **CCCCCO** is a simple primary alcohol, I would predict a value slightly lower than 0.82 but still positive.  

### Final Prediction:
The property value for **CCCCCO** is likely **~0.75**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. If the property is something like "logP" or "dipole moment," the reasoning might differ, but the examples suggest alcohols have positive values around 0.8.)

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: -0.8431134493457433
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: The presence of a benzene ring is common in many examples. For instance:
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2** has a value of **-0.97426443** (but this has two aromatic rings with electron-donating -NH2 groups).
   - **c1ccncc1** (a simple aromatic ring) has a value of **0.06557549**.
   - The benzene ring here is substituted with an amide group, which may slightly lower the property value.

2. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: Amides are polar and can hydrogen bond, often reducing the property value. Examples:
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1** has a value of **-0.43092465**.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC** has a value of **-0.44029258**.

3. **Sulfonyl Group (S(=O)(=O))**: This is a strongly electron-withdrawing group. Examples with sulfonyl or similar polar groups:
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has a value of **-0.08431134**.
   - Sulfonyl groups tend to reduce the property value but not as drastically as amides.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring (CCO1)**: The 5-membered ring with oxygen and sulfur is somewhat similar to **Sc2nc1ccccc1s2** (value **0.35598123**), but the sulfonyl group here is more polar.

5. **Methyl Group (CC1)**: Alkyl groups like methyl slightly increase the property value (e.g., **CCCC(=O)CCC** has **0.55270771**).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The molecule is somewhat similar to **CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C** (value **-0.01873585**), which also has a benzene ring, polar groups (P=O, C=O), and alkyl chains.
- The sulfonyl and amide groups here are more polar than in that example, so the value should be lower.

### Predicted Value:
Considering the balance between the slightly positive contribution from the alkyl group and the negative contributions from the amide and sulfonyl groups, the predicted value is likely in the range of **-0.2 to -0.4**.

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.3** (specific value: **-0.31850953**, similar to **CCC(Br)(CC)C(=O)NC(N)=O** which has polar groups and alkyl chains).  

However, given the strong polar effects of the sulfonyl and amide, a slightly more negative value may be appropriate, such as:  
**-0.35**.  

But to match the precision of the examples, a plausible prediction is:  
**-0.31850953** (same as the structurally somewhat similar example above).  

### Final Answer:
**-0.31850953**

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: -2.098415696149407
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular properties like polarity, aromaticity, functional groups, and steric effects. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Given Molecule:
**SMILES:** `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C`

### Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic system**: Contains a benzene ring (`c2ccccc2`) with an electron-withdrawing nitro group (`N(=O)=O`), which is highly polar and likely decreases the property value (as seen in similar nitro-aromatics in the examples).
2. **Ester groups**: Two methoxycarbonyl (`COC(=O)`) groups, which are polar but not as strongly electron-withdrawing as nitro groups. Esters in the examples have mixed effects, but here they are adjacent to other polar groups.
3. **Amide-like fragment**: The `NC(=C)` moiety suggests some polarity, similar to amides, which tend to lower the property value.
4. **Steric hindrance**: The molecule is bulky with multiple substituents, which may increase the property value slightly (as bulky nonpolar groups like `CCC(C)(C)C` tend to raise it).

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Nitro-aromatics**: 
  - `Cc1cccc(N=O)=O` has a property value of `-0.43092465`.
  - `CC(C)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O` is not directly given, but similar nitro compounds have negative values.
- **Esters**: 
  - `CCCCC(=O)OC` has `0.36534916`, but this is a simple ester without other polar groups.
- **Bulky nonpolar groups**: 
  - `CCC(C)(C)C` has `0.8618493`, but this lacks polar groups.

### Combined Effect:
The nitro group and ester groups will dominate, pulling the property value downward. The steric bulk may offset this slightly, but not enough to make it positive. 

### Closest Analogues:
- The molecule resembles a hybrid of nitro-aromatics and esters, with additional steric bulk. 
- A reasonable estimate is between `-0.5` and `-1.0`, leaning toward the more negative end due to the nitro group's strong effect.

### Predicted Value:
Based on the examples, the predicted property value for `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C` is:

**-0.79627381**  

(This matches the value for `CC1=C(CCCO1)C(=O)Nc2ccccc2`, which has similar polar/aromatic features, though the nitro group here may push it slightly lower. Given the data, this is the most plausible fit.)

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.4402925791027773
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**C(=O)N**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). It is a cyclic diamide (imide) structure, resembling a diketopiperazine or succinimide derivative.
2. **Polarity**: The presence of two highly polar amide groups suggests significant polarity, which often correlates with lower property values in the given dataset (e.g., other polar/amide-containing molecules like **CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3ccccc23** have negative values).
3. **Rigidity**: The cyclopropane ring and cyclic diamide structure introduce rigidity, which may further lower the property value (rigid aromatic systems in the dataset tend to have negative values).
4. **Comparable Examples**:
   - **c1ccncc1** (pyridine, property = 0.06557549): Less polar than our molecule but somewhat rigid.
   - **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12** (property = -0.68385869): Polar, rigid, and heterocyclic like our molecule.
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (property = -0.18735854): Less polar but rigid and cyclic.

### Prediction:
Given the high polarity and rigidity of **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, its property value is likely **negative** and moderately low, similar to other polar/rigid cyclic molecules in the dataset. A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.4 and -0.7**.

#### Final Predicted Value:
**-0.55** (specific value chosen based on interpolation of comparable examples). 

This aligns with the trend where rigid, polar, and heterocyclic structures (especially those with multiple amides) exhibit lower property values in the provided data.

Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 1.133519193009278
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCC** (chloroethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Halogenated Alkanes**:
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): **0.8618493**
   - **CCC(C)(C)CC** (branched alkane): **0.8618493**
   - **CCC1CCCCC1** (cyclohexane with propyl substituent): **0.8618493**
   - **C1CC=CC1** (cyclopentene): **0.6182832**
   - **C1CCC=CCC1** (cycloheptene): **0.6182832**
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): **0.40282087**
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (iodochlorobenzene): **1.08667956**
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (tetrachlorobenzene): **1.21783054**
   - **CC#N** (acetonitrile): **0.38408502**

2. **Chlorinated Alkanes**:
   - The presence of halogens (especially chlorine) tends to increase the property value compared to non-halogenated analogs. For example:
     - Chlorobenzene (**Clc1ccccc1**) has a higher value (0.40282087) than benzene (not in the list, but inferred to be lower).
     - Tetrachlorobenzene has a much higher value (1.21783054).

3. **Small Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - **ClCC** (chloroethane) is a simple chlorinated alkane. Comparing it to similar small molecules:
     - **CC#N** (acetonitrile, a small polar molecule): **0.38408502**
     - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene, aromatic with one Cl): **0.40282087**
     - **CCCCC** (pentane, nonpolar): **0.8618493**

   Chloroethane is smaller and less polar than chlorobenzene but more polar than pentane. The presence of chlorine likely increases the property value compared to pure alkanes but not as much as in aromatic systems.

### Prediction for **ClCC**:
Given the examples:
- The property value for simple chlorinated alkanes seems to be in the range of **0.4 to 0.6**, depending on size and substitution.
- Chloroethane is smaller than pentane (which has a value of 0.8618493) but has a polar C-Cl bond, which may reduce the value slightly compared to pure alkanes (due to polarity effects).
- However, chlorobenzene (with one Cl) has a value of 0.40282087, and chloroethane is somewhat similar in terms of substitution but less conjugated.

A reasonable estimate for **ClCC** would be slightly lower than chlorobenzene but higher than very small polar molecules like acetonitrile (0.38408502). 

**Predicted property value for ClCC: ~0.40**

### Final Answer:
**0.40** (approximate, based on trends in the given data).
==================================================
Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 1.1522550474391833
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms (e.g., **ClC(Cl)Cl**, **ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)...**) tend to have higher positive property values (e.g., 1.67685897 for **ClCC(Cl)Cl**, 4.12188797 for the highly chlorinated cage structure).
   - The presence of **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a trichloromethyl group) seems to contribute significantly to increasing the property value (e.g., **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has a value of 0.7588021).

2. **Aromatic Systems with Chlorine**:
   - Simple chlorinated aromatics like **Clc1ccccc1** (not explicitly in the examples but similar to **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2**) have moderately negative or near-zero values (-0.32787745 for **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2**).
   - When combined with other electronegative groups or heteroatoms, the property tends to decrease further.

3. **Heterocycles with Chlorine**:
   - The molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** contains a chlorinated pyridine ring (**Clc1ccccn1**) and a **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group. 
   - Pyridine itself (without substitution) is not in the examples, but similar heterocycles like **c2ccc1ocnc1c2** have a value of -0.36534916.
   - Adding chlorines to such systems tends to increase the property value, but the **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group likely dominates.

4. **Combined Effects**:
   - The **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group is a strong positive contributor, but the pyridine ring with chlorine may partially offset this. 
   - Compare to **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (0.7588021), where the aromatic system is less polarizable (benzene) and the value is still positive but not as high as aliphatic chlorinated compounds.

### Prediction:
Given the strong positive contribution of **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** and the moderating effect of the chlorinated pyridine ring, the property value for **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** should be **positive and moderately high**, but not as extreme as fully aliphatic chlorinated compounds. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.85**  

This is based on:
- The trichloromethyl group pushing the value up (similar to **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** at 0.7588021).
- The pyridine ring slightly reducing the effect compared to pure aliphatic chlorination.
==================================================
Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: 0.8243775949158385
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as the presence of halogens (Cl, F, Br), oxygen-containing functional groups (OH, CO, etc.), aromaticity, and chain length/branching. 

For the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (which is 2-hexanol, a branched alcohol with the structure of a 6-carbon chain and an OH group on the second carbon), we can compare it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. **CCCC(O)CCC** (1-hexanol, linear alcohol) has a property value of **0.82437759**.
2. **CCC(C)CCO** (another branched alcohol, likely 2-methyl-1-pentanol) has a property value of **0.82437759**.
3. **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (a phenyl-substituted alcohol, 1-phenylethanol) has a property value of **0.09367927**.

The property value for alcohols seems to be higher for linear or less sterically hindered alcohols (e.g., 0.824 for hexanol-like structures) and lower for aromatic or more sterically hindered alcohols (e.g., 0.093 for phenylethanol). 

Since **CCCCC(C)O** is a branched alcohol (2-hexanol), it is structurally similar to **CCC(C)CCO** (likely 2-methyl-1-pentanol), which has a value of **0.82437759**. The branching in 2-hexanol is not drastically different from the examples, so the property value should be close to these. 

### Predicted property value for **CCCCC(C)O**: **0.82437759** (same as the closely related examples). 

This is consistent with the trend that non-aromatic alcohols with moderate branching have property values around this range.

Iteration: 67
SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 1.0304719936447981
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl): Property = -0.05620756
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene): Property = 0.48713222
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (dichlorohydroquinone): Property = 0.48713222
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (dichlorophenol): Property = 0.48713222

   These examples show that **symmetrically disubstituted halogenated benzenes** (especially 1,4-substitution) tend to have property values around **0.487** when the substituents are halogens (Cl) or hydroxyl groups. The presence of bromine (Br) is chemically similar to chlorine (Cl) but slightly larger and less electronegative, which may slightly alter the property.

2. **Effect of Bromine vs. Chlorine**:
   - **CI** (iodomethane): Property = 1.54570799 (higher due to iodine's polarizability).
   - **ClC(Cl)Cl** (chloroform): Property = 1.67685897.
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl** (carbon tetrachloride): Property = 1.94852886.

   Halogens increase the property value, with heavier halogens (Br, I) likely contributing more than chlorine. However, in aromatic systems, the effect is less pronounced due to delocalization.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution Pattern**:
   - The 1,4-disubstitution pattern (para) tends to yield higher property values than ortho or meta in halogenated benzenes (e.g., 0.487 for 1,4-dichlorobenzene vs. -0.056 for dichlorobiphenyl).

### Prediction for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 (1,4-dibromobenzene):
- Structurally, this is analogous to 1,4-dichlorobenzene but with bromine instead of chlorine. Bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine, which may **slightly increase** the property value compared to the chlorine analogue.
- Given that 1,4-dichlorobenzene has a property value of **0.487**, and bromine is a heavier halogen, I estimate the value for 1,4-dibromobenzene to be **slightly higher**, around **0.55**.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**0.55** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The value likely reflects a physicochemical property influenced by halogenation and aromaticity.)

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 1.0304719936447981
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples.

### Structural Analysis:
1. The molecule is a **polychlorinated biphenyl derivative** with chlorine atoms substituted on both aromatic rings. 
2. It is highly similar to the second example in the list: **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**, which has a property value of **2.11715155**.
   - The second example has **10 chlorine atoms**, while the given molecule has **8 chlorine atoms** (slightly less chlorinated).
   - The given molecule has a **less symmetric substitution pattern** (some positions are not fully chlorinated compared to the second example).

3. The property seems to **increase with the degree of chlorination and symmetry** in these biphenyl systems.

### Prediction:
Given that the second example (fully chlorinated biphenyl) has a value of **2.11715155**, the given molecule (less chlorinated but still heavily substituted) should have a **slightly lower value**. 

A reasonable estimate would be **~2.05**, considering:
- The trend that more chlorination increases the property.
- The given molecule is less chlorinated than the second example but more chlorinated than simpler aromatic systems.

### Final Predicted Value:
**2.05** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trend analysis).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)*

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: -1.6768589714765338
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/LogP Trends**:
   - Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCC**, **CCCCCCCCC**) have high positive values (~0.86), indicating hydrophobicity.
   - Polar groups (e.g., **-OH**, **-O-**, **-C=O**, **-N=O**, **-Cl**) reduce the property value (make it more negative).
   - Aromatic rings with polar substituents (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1Cl**) have moderate positive values (~0.67).
   - Phosphorus/sulfur-containing groups (e.g., **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O**) can vary but often have positive values (~0.46 to ~2.05).

2. **Structural Features of the Target Molecule**:
   - The molecule has a central **phosphate group (OP(=O)(O...)O...)**, which is polar and negatively charged at physiological pH (lowers the property value).
   - It has **two aromatic rings (one with a methyl group and one with a methyl and phenyl group)**, which add hydrophobicity (increase the property value).
   - The **methyl groups (Cc1...)** add slight hydrophobicity.
   - The **overall structure is bulky and partially polar**, similar to some of the mid-range examples.

3. **Comparison to Similar Examples**:
   - **COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has a value of **-0.159** (polar groups with aromatic rings and Cl).
   - **Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1** has a value of **-1.012** (polar amide and aromatic rings).
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC** has a value of **2.052** (highly hydrophobic with P/S).
   - The target molecule is less hydrophobic than **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC** but more polar than simple aromatics.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the **hydrophobic aromatic rings/methyl groups** and the **highly polar phosphate group**, the property value is likely **moderately negative**, similar to molecules with polar groups and aromatic systems. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

This aligns with the trend where polar groups (especially phosphates) significantly reduce the value, while aromaticity and alkyl groups partially offset this effect.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -0.018735854429905434
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: The presence of **CF3** (a strongly electron-withdrawing group) is likely to decrease the property value. Examples with **CF3** or similar electronegative groups (e.g., **N(=O)=O**) tend to have negative values (e.g., **-0.79627381** for **CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C**).
2. **Aromatic ring with substitution**: The **CF3** is attached to an aromatic ring, which is further substituted with a heterocyclic group. Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups (like **NO2** in **Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O**, **-1.18035883**) tend to lower the property.
3. **Heterocyclic group (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O)**: This is a complex, polar, and likely electron-withdrawing group due to the **C=O** and **Cl** substitutions. Such groups often correlate with negative property values (e.g., **-0.55270771** for **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccccc1**).
4. **Chlorine atoms (Cl)**: While **Cl** can sometimes increase the property (e.g., **Clc1ccc(I)cc1**, **1.08667956**), in this case, they are part of a larger electron-withdrawing system, likely contributing to a lower value.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The molecule **CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C** (property **-0.79627381**) shares features like **CF3**, **C=O**, and aromatic substitution.
- The molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccccc1** (property **-0.55270771**) has a **C=O** attached to an aromatic system.
- The molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (property **-0.6182832**) has strong electron-withdrawing **NO2** groups.

Given the combined effects of **CF3**, **C=O**, **Cl**, and the heterocycle, the property value is expected to be moderately negative, similar to the above examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.75** (a reasonable estimate based on the structural similarities and trends in the given data). 

This balances the strong electron-withdrawing effects of **CF3** and the heterocycle with the contributions from the aromatic system and **Cl** substitutions.

Iteration: 71
SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6182831961868788
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is a methoxy-substituted benzene ring with a nitro group (**N(=O)=O**). 
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing.
   - The methoxy group (**OCH3**) is electron-donating but less so than a hydroxyl group.

2. Similar molecules in the dataset:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene) has a property value of **-0.99300028**.
     - This molecule has two nitro groups, which are highly electron-withdrawing, leading to a strongly negative value.
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol) has a property value of **-0.05620756**.
     - Here, the hydroxyl group is electron-donating, leading to a less negative value than nitro-substituted aromatics.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene) is more negative than **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** because it has two nitro groups instead of one.

3. The methoxy group (**OCH3**) is less electron-donating than a hydroxyl group but still counteracts the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group to some extent. Thus, the property value should be less negative than dinitrobenzene but more negative than phenol.

### Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** should be between **-0.99300028** (dinitrobenzene) and **-0.05620756** (phenol). 

A reasonable estimate would be closer to the dinitrobenzene value but less extreme due to the presence of only one nitro group and the counteracting methoxy group. 

**Predicted property value: -0.65** (approximate, based on interpolation from similar structures). 

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at other nitro-aromatics:
- **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: -0.993 (two nitro groups)
- **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** likely has a value less negative than this but more negative than phenol (-0.056). 

A plausible value is around **-0.6 to -0.7**. 

**Final predicted property value: -0.65**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups in the dataset.)

**Answer:** The predicted property value for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is approximately **-0.65**.

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 2.7916423100559076
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them with the provided examples to identify patterns:

### Given Molecule:
**ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**

This is a highly chlorinated polycyclic structure with multiple chlorine atoms attached to a rigid, saturated carbon framework. It resembles **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (hexachlorocyclohexane) from the examples, which has a property value of **2.49186864**. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: The presence of multiple chlorine atoms (especially in a saturated/aliphatic system) tends to increase the property value significantly. For example:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a value of **1.40518908**.
   - **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (hexachlorocyclohexane) has a value of **2.49186864**.
   - **BrC(Br)Br** (bromoform) has a value of **2.21083082**.

2. **Rigid Polycyclic Structure**: The given molecule is more complex and rigid than hexachlorocyclohexane, with additional chlorine atoms and ring strain. This could further increase the property value.

3. **Comparison**: The given molecule has **8 chlorine atoms** (more than hexachlorocyclohexane's 6) and a more constrained polycyclic structure. Thus, its property value should be **higher than 2.49186864**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, the value for **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl** is likely in the range of **2.6 to 3.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 2.75**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an extrapolation based on the clear trend of increasing values with higher chlorine content and structural rigidity.)

Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes**: 
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexane): 0.8618 (non-polar, hydrophobic)
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): 0.6183 (moderate hydrophobicity)
   - **CCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): 0.1312 (aromatic + alkyl chain)

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)...** (complex ether/alcohol): -2.2577 (highly polar, negative value)
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ethyl ester with amine): -0.5527 (polar, negative)
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (phenylethanol): 0.0933 (moderate polarity)

   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: -0.5527 (ester + aromatic amine)

4. **Halogenated Compounds**:
   - **ClC1C(Cl)...** (hexachlorocyclohexane): 2.4919 (very hydrophobic)
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene): 0.6745 (moderate hydrophobicity)

5. **Nitro/NO2 Groups**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): -0.9930 (very polar)

### Analysis of **CCCOC=O** (Propyl Formate):
- This is a simple ester (formate ester with a propyl group). 
- Esters generally have moderate polarity due to the polar carbonyl (C=O) and ether (O) groups but are less polar than acids or alcohols.
- From the examples:
  - Ethyl ester with an aromatic amine: -0.5527.
  - Other esters with additional polar groups: more negative.
  - Simple esters without strong polar groups (like propyl formate) are likely less negative.

### Predicted Property:
Given that propyl formate is a simple ester with no additional polar groups (like amines or nitro groups), its property value should be closer to neutral but slightly negative due to the ester's polarity. 

Comparing to similar molecules:
- **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: -0.5527 (ester + aromatic amine, more polar).
- **CC(O)c1ccccc1**: 0.0933 (alcohol, less polar than ester).

Thus, **propyl formate (CCCOC=O)** should have a value between these, likely around **-0.2 to -0.4**. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.3** (specific value: **-0.28103782**, matching the precision of the examples).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCOC=O** is **-0.28103782**.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.36534916138315576
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Long Hydrocarbon Chain (CCCCCCCCC)**: The molecule has a long aliphatic chain (10 carbons, including the carbonyl carbon). From the examples, molecules with long hydrocarbon chains (e.g., CCCCCCc1ccccc1, property = 0.13115098; CCC1CCCCC1, property = 0.8618493) tend to have positive property values, especially if they are purely aliphatic (no rings or polar groups). The longer the chain, the more hydrophobic the molecule, which may increase the property value.

2. **Ester Functional Group (C(=O)OCC)**: The molecule is an ester (specifically, decyl acetate with an ethyl group instead of methyl). Esters are polar but not as polar as acids or alcohols. From the examples:
   - COCC(=O)N(...) (ester-like) has a property = -0.89932101, but this also includes an amide and aromatic rings, which complicate the comparison.
   - CCOC(=O)CCN(...) (ester) has property = -0.94616065, but this is part of a complex structure with multiple polar groups.
   - Simpler esters or ethers (e.g., CCOc1ccccc1, property = -0.05620756) have modest property values.

3. **Lack of Aromaticity or Halogens**: The molecule has no aromatic rings or halogens, which often lower (e.g., aromatic rings) or raise (e.g., halogens) the property value significantly.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (heptylbenzene): Property = 0.13115098. This has a long chain + aromatic ring. Our molecule has a longer chain and an ester, which is more polar than an aromatic ring but less polar than a pure alcohol/acid.
- **CC(=O)C3CCC4...** (steroid-like): Property = 0.27166989. This is a complex aliphatic structure with some polarity.
- **CCCCC=C(CC)C=O** (unsaturated aldehyde): Property = 0.3091416. This has a polar aldehyde group and unsaturation.
- **CC** (ethane): Property = 0.8618493. Purely aliphatic, very nonpolar.

### Inference:
The long hydrocarbon chain (10 carbons) will dominate, giving a positive contribution to the property value. The ester group is polar but not as much as an acid or alcohol, so it will slightly reduce the property value compared to a pure hydrocarbon. 

Given that:
- CCC1CCCCC1 (cyclohexane derivative) = 0.8618493 (purely aliphatic, no polar groups).
- CCCCCCc1ccccc1 = 0.13115098 (long chain + aromatic).
- C=CCC=C (butadiene) = 0.37471709 (unsaturation, no polar groups).

Our molecule is closer to the purely aliphatic examples but with a polar ester. A reasonable estimate would be between **0.3 and 0.6**. 

### Final Prediction:
Given the dominance of the long hydrocarbon chain and the modest polarity of the ester, a plausible property value for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** is:  
**≈ 0.55**  

This aligns with examples like CCCCCC=C(CC)C=O (0.309) but adjusted higher due to the longer chain and ester being less polar than an aldehyde.  

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**0.55** (rounded to two decimal places).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend that long aliphatic chains increase the value and polar groups decrease it.)

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.3021418828784261
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic rings with polar substituents**: The molecule contains two benzene rings with multiple polar substituents (OH, Cl, C=O, NO2). 
   - Similar to: **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property: -1.199) and **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)c1ccccc1** (property: -1.171), which have aromatic systems with polar groups and negative property values.
2. **Nitro group (NO2)**: The presence of **N(=O)=O** is seen in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property: -0.159) and **NNc1ccccc1** (property: -0.094), suggesting a slight negative contribution.
3. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: Seen in **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (property: -0.365) and other examples, typically contributing to negative values.
4. **Chlorine substituents**: Multiple Cl atoms are present, similar to **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property: -0.159) and **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** (property: -0.159), which slightly reduce the property value.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The molecule is most similar to **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property: -1.199), but with an additional nitro group and more chlorines. The nitro group and extra Cl may further reduce the property value slightly.
- Another close analog is **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)c1ccccc1** (property: -1.171), which lacks Cl and NO2 but has a similar amide-aromatic system.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarities and the additive effects of polar groups (OH, Cl, NO2, C=O), the property value is likely in the range of **-1.2 to -1.4**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-1.25** (interpolating between the closest examples). 

### Final Answer:
**-1.25**

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 0.42155672467287186
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Chlorine (Cl) substitution**: Highly chlorinated molecules (e.g., hexachlorobenzene derivatives) tend to have **high positive values** (e.g., 0.946–1.030).  
2. **Oxygen/nitrogen heterocycles**: Molecules with polar groups (e.g., amides, lactams) or conjugated systems (e.g., pyridine, imidazole) tend to have **negative values** (e.g., -0.805 to -1.564).  
3. **Aliphatic chains**: Non-polar hydrocarbons (e.g., octane) have **moderate positive values** (~0.86).  
4. **Sulfur-containing groups**: Thioethers (e.g., SC) or phosphorothioates (P=S) often **increase the value slightly** (e.g., 0.768 for COP(=S)(OC)SCC...).  

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
- **Structure**: The molecule is a **bis(phosphorothioate)** with a **thioether-linked biphenyl core** (two benzene rings connected by sulfur, each with a phosphorothioate group).  
- **Features**:  
  - Two **P=S** groups (electron-withdrawing but bulky).  
  - **Thioether bridge (S)** between aromatic rings (slightly polarizable).  
  - No strongly electron-donating groups (e.g., -OH, -NH₂).  
  - No halogens (e.g., Cl, F), which would push the value higher.  

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
1. **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N...** (value = 0.768): Contains P=S and a thioether, but also polar amide. Our molecule lacks the amide but has two P=S groups.  
2. **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (value = 1.030): Highly chlorinated, but our molecule has no Cl.  
3. **CCSSCC** (value = 1.518): Pure aliphatic disulfide (very non-polar). Our molecule is more polar due to P=S and aryl groups.  

### Prediction:
The molecule's **two P=S groups and aromatic thioether** will likely give it a **moderate positive value**, but less than chlorinated compounds or pure sulfides. Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: ~0.65**  

### Rationale:
- The phosphorothioates add polarity but are offset by the aromatic/thioether contributions.  
- No strong electron-withdrawing/donating effects dominate.  
- Similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC... (0.768)** but with slightly less polarity due to lack of amide.  

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**0.65** (approximate, based on structural analogies).

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6182831961868788
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - The molecule contains a **phenol group (Oc1ccccc1)** and a **nitro group (N(=O)=O)** attached to the benzene ring.
   - Similar molecules in the dataset:
     - `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` (property: -0.55270771): Contains an amide and phenol.
     - `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (property: -0.43092465): Contains a nitro group attached to a toluene ring.
     - `Nc1cccc(Cl)c1` (property: 0.21546233): Contains an amino group and chloro substituent.

2. **Effect of Nitro Group**:
   - Nitro groups are strongly electron-withdrawing and often reduce the property value (make it more negative). Compare:
     - `Cc1ccccc1` (not in the dataset, but alkylbenzenes like `CCCCC` have positive values ~0.8-0.9).
     - `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has a much lower value (-0.43092465) due to the nitro group.

3. **Effect of Phenol (OH)**:
   - Phenol groups can slightly reduce the property value compared to plain benzene (due to polarity and H-bonding). For example:
     - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (property: 0.7588021) is lower than typical halogenated benzenes like `Clc1cccc(Br)c1` (0.85248138).

4. **Combined Effects**:
   - The molecule `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has both a phenol and a nitro group, which are likely to reduce the property value additively.
   - Comparing to `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (-0.43092465), replacing the methyl with a hydroxyl (more polar) would further reduce the value.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property for `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` is expected to be more negative than `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (-0.43092465) but less negative than `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` (-0.55270771). A reasonable estimate is around **-0.5 to -0.6**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is **-0.55270771** (same as `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` due to similar polarity and substituent effects).

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 0.262301962018676
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, size, and functional groups. The molecule in question is a large, highly polar carbohydrate with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH), which are capable of extensive hydrogen bonding. 

From the examples:
- Molecules with many polar groups (e.g., hydroxyls, amines) tend to have negative property values (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has a value of **0.67449076**, which is relatively high for a polar molecule, but it is smaller and less complex).
- Large, non-polar hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`) have high positive values (~0.86).
- The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) often increases the property value, especially in aromatic systems.

The given molecule is a complex oligosaccharide (likely a derivative of a sugar like maltose or cellobiose) with many hydroxyl groups and ether linkages. Given its high polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity, it is likely to have a **moderate to high positive property value**, but not as high as non-polar hydrocarbons or heavily halogenated compounds. 

Comparing to similar examples:
- `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (a smaller sugar) has a value of **0.67449076**.
- The given molecule is larger and more polar, but the additional hydroxyls and ether linkages may not linearly increase the property. 

**Predicted property value: ~0.5 to 0.7**  
A reasonable estimate would be **0.65**, similar to the smaller sugar but accounting for the larger size and additional polar groups. 

### Final answer: **0.65** (approximate, based on trend analysis).

Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.4496605063177302
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkanes and Alkenes/Alkynes**:
   - **CCCC(=O)C** (a ketone with an alkyl chain): 0.55270771
   - **CCCCCC=O** (an aldehyde with an alkyl chain): 0.55270771
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (a nonene): 0.6182832
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (an alcohol with a medium alkyl chain): 0.82437759
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (a long-chain alcohol): 0.82437759
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (a longer-chain alcohol): 0.82437759
   - **CC(C)OC(C)C** (an ether with branched alkyl groups): 0.82437759

   These suggest that:
   - Longer alkyl chains tend to have higher positive values (~0.8).
   - Simple alkenes/alkynes (e.g., **CCCCCCCCC=C**) have slightly lower values (~0.6).
   - Functional groups like alcohols/ethers increase the value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

2. **Alkynes**:
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (a dinitrile with an alkyne-like structure): -0.82437759
     - This is a special case with two nitrile groups, which likely dominate the property value (negative).
   - No simple alkynes are present in the examples, but we can infer from alkenes that unsaturation (double/triple bonds) reduces the value compared to saturated chains.

3. **Small Hydrocarbons**:
   - **CCC(C)C(=O)C** (a branched ketone): 0.55270771
   - **CC(=O)C** (acetone): Not directly given, but similar to **CCCC(=O)C** (0.55270771).
   - **CC#C** (propyne) is not present, but **CCC#C** (1-butyne) is a similar small alkyne.

### Prediction for **CCC#C**:
- **CCC#C** is a small alkyne with 4 carbons and no other functional groups.
- Compared to **CCCC(=O)C** (0.55270771) and **CCCCCCCCC=C** (0.6182832), the property value for **CCC#C** should be lower because:
  - It has a triple bond (more unsaturation than a double bond).
  - It lacks the stabilizing effect of a carbonyl group or long alkyl chain.
- From the examples, simple unsaturated hydrocarbons tend to have values in the range of **0.5 to 0.6**, but alkynes may be slightly lower due to higher unsaturation.

Given the lack of exact matches, a reasonable estimate is slightly below the alkene values. A plausible prediction is:

**Predicted property value for CCC#C: 0.5** (rounded to one significant figure based on trends). 

However, looking more closely, the smallest alkene-like molecule (**CCCCCCCCC=C**) has a value of 0.6182832, and the alkyne should be lower. A more precise estimate might be **~0.55**, similar to **CCCC(=O)C** but without the carbonyl influence. 

Given the uncertainty, I would predict:  
**0.55** (aligning with the lower end of simple unsaturated hydrocarbons). 

But since the examples show **CCCC(=O)C** at 0.55270771 and **CCCCCCCCC=C** at 0.6182832, **CCC#C** is likely slightly lower than 0.55. 

Final prediction:  
**0.5** (approximate, considering the trends). 

However, to match the precision of the given data, I'll provide a more specific estimate:  
**0.52** (interpolating between the alkene and smaller alkyne trends). 

But given the lack of exact matches, the most defensible answer is:  
**0.55** (similar to **CCCC(=O)C**, as alkynes and carbonyls may have comparable effects in this context). 

After reconsidering, the value is likely closer to **0.6** (similar to **CCCCCCCCC=C** but slightly lower). 

Given the ambiguity, the best match is:  
**0.55270771** (same as **CCCC(=O)C**, assuming the triple bond and carbonyl have similar impacts). 

But this is speculative. The true value is likely between **0.5 and 0.6**. 

### Final Answer:  
**Predicted property value for CCC#C: 0.55**

Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 1.3302456645232845
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Presence of Phosphorus (P) and Sulfur (S):**
   - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a property value of **0.76817003**.
   - **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** has a property value of **0.73069832**.
   - Both molecules contain **P(=S)** and exhibit property values in the **~0.73–0.77** range.

2. **Chlorine (Cl) Substituents:**
   - Molecules with multiple Cl atoms (e.g., **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**) tend to have higher property values (e.g., **1.03047199**).
   - However, when combined with polar groups (e.g., **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**), the value drops to **-0.15925476**.

3. **Ether Linkage (Oc1cc...):**
   - The fragment **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** appears in **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, which has a value of **-0.15925476**, but this molecule has additional polar groups.

4. **Alkyl Chains (CC, CCO):**
   - Non-polar alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCCC**) increase the property value (e.g., **0.8618493**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
- **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** contains:
  - A **P(=S)** group (similar to the examples with values ~0.73–0.77).
  - Three **Cl** substituents on the aromatic ring (could increase the value, but the **P(=S)** and ether linkage may moderate this).
  - An ethoxy group (**CCO**) and a **CC** chain (slightly increasing the value).

### Comparison to Closest Examples:
- **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (value: **0.76817003**) is very similar structurally:
  - Both have **P(=S)**, **O-alkyl**, and **Cl** on an aromatic ring.
  - The target molecule lacks the **C(=O)N(C(C)C)** group (which may slightly reduce polarity).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarities, the property value for **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** is likely slightly lower than **0.76817003** due to fewer polar groups but higher than **0.73069832** due to more Cl substituents. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.75** (approximate, likely in the range **0.74–0.76**). 

For precision, based on the closest example (**0.76817003**), I would predict:

**0.760** (rounded slightly lower due to reduced polarity). 

However, since the examples with **P(=S)** and **Cl** are limited, the most defensible answer is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.76817003** (same as the closest analogue). 

But acknowledging minor adjustments, a refined estimate is **0.760**. 

### Final Answer:
**0.760** (approximate). 

(Note: Without a clear model or more examples, this is an educated interpolation.)

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.46839636074763524
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (c1nccc)** with a **hydrazide group (C(=O)NN)** attached. 
   - The pyridine ring is aromatic and polar due to the nitrogen.
   - The hydrazide group is highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (donor and acceptor).

2. **Key Observations from Examples**:
   - Molecules with **polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NH, -NO2, -CONH, -COO)** tend to have **negative property values** (e.g., -0.00936793 for CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1, -1.07731163 for CCN2c1cc(Cl)ccc1NC(=O)c3cccnc23).
   - Molecules with **nonpolar/aliphatic groups** tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., 0.6182832 for C=C, 1.13351919 for ClCC(C)C).
   - The presence of **multiple polar groups or conjugated systems** further decreases the property value (e.g., -1.83611373 for CC(=O)CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O).

3. **Comparison**:
   - The hydrazide group (**C(=O)NN**) is more polar than a simple amide or ester, suggesting a stronger tendency toward negative values.
   - The pyridine ring adds some polarity but is less impactful than the hydrazide.
   - Similar molecules with polar substituents on aromatic rings (e.g., -0.55270771 for c1ccccc1(OC(=O)NC), -0.87121723 for Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2) support a negative prediction.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong polarity of the hydrazide group and the aromatic pyridine ring, the property value is likely **negative and moderately low**. 

A reasonable estimate based on similar structures is:  
**-0.75** (approximate, considering the hydrazide's impact).  

For higher precision, we might align it closer to other highly polar aromatic examples like **-0.87121723 (Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2)** or **-0.97426443 (c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23)**, but the hydrazide is less conjugated than these, so a slightly less negative value is plausible.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.75** (specific value inferred from trends).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the assumption that the property scales inversely with polarity/hydrogen bonding capacity, as suggested by the examples.)

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 1.2271984651588048
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**: 
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., `-NO2`, `-OH`, `-Cl`, `-Br`, `-I`, `-S-`, `-N-`, `-O-`, `-C=O`) tend to have lower (more negative) property values unless balanced by hydrophobic regions.
   - Example: `Cc1cccc2c(C)cccc12` (aromatic + alkyl) = -0.355, while `CCCCCCCI` (alkyl + I) = 1.545.

2. **Phosphorus/Sulfur-Containing Groups**:
   - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1` = -0.084 (P=S with polar NO2).
   - `CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1` = -0.224 (S and polar groups).

3. **Amide/Carbonyl Groups**:
   - `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` = 0.177 (amide + alkyl).
   - `CCN2c1cc(N(C)C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23` = -1.536 (complex amide + polar N).

4. **Hydrophobic/Alkyl Dominance**:
   - `CCCCCCCC#C` (long alkyl + alkyne) = 0.449.
   - `C/C1CCC(\C)CC1` (cyclohexane) = 0.861.

5. **Combined Features**:
   - The given molecule has:
     - Two `P=S` groups (strongly polar).
     - An amide `C(=O)N` (polar).
     - Multiple alkyl chains (`CCC`, `CCCCC`) (hydrophobic).
     - Thioether `SCC` (moderately polar).

### Prediction:
- The molecule has significant polar contributions from `P=S` and `C(=O)N`, but these are partially offset by the long alkyl chains. 
- Similar molecules (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1` = -0.084) suggest a slightly negative value.
- The amide and additional `P=S` may push the value further negative than the example above, but the alkyl chains prevent it from being highly negative.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the balance of polar and hydrophobic groups, a reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.25** (range: -0.3 to -0.2). 

This aligns with the trend where polar groups dominate but are mitigated by alkyl bulk. For precision, we might select:  
**-0.22483025** (matching the `CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1` example, which has similar polar/hydrophobic balance).

### Final Answer:
**-0.22483025**
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.8618493037756494
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property value for **CCCCCCCC** (octane):

1. **Trend for alkanes**: 
   - **CCC(O)CC** (pentanol) has a value of **0.82437759**, but this includes a polar -OH group.
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol) also has a value of **0.82437759**, again due to the -OH group.
   - **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol) has the same value (**0.82437759**), suggesting the -OH group dominates the property.
   - **CCCC/C=C/C** (a non-polar alkene) has a value of **0.6182832**, which is lower than the alcohols but still positive.

2. **Non-polar hydrocarbons**:
   - **C/C1CCCCC1\C** (a cyclohexane derivative) has a value of **0.8618493**.
   - **CCCC1CCCC1** (a cyclohexane with an alkyl chain) also has **0.8618493**.
   - These values suggest that non-polar, saturated hydrocarbons tend to have property values in the **~0.6 to ~0.9** range.

3. **Octane (CCCCCCCC)**:
   - This is a fully saturated, non-polar alkane with no functional groups.
   - It is larger than the cyclic examples but lacks the rigidity of a ring.
   - Based on the trend, its value should be slightly lower than the cyclic hydrocarbons but higher than the alkene (**CCCC/C=C/C**).

### Predicted property value for **CCCCCCCC**:  
**0.78** (approximate, likely between 0.7 and 0.8 based on the trend).  

However, looking more closely at the examples:
- **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol, with -OH) is **0.82437759**.
- **CCCC/C=C/C** (alkene) is **0.6182832**.
- The cyclic non-polar hydrocarbons are **0.8618493**.

Since octane is non-polar and acyclic, its value should be between the alkene and the cyclic hydrocarbons. A reasonable estimate is:

**Final predicted value: 0.75** (interpolated between 0.618 and 0.862).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data.)

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: -0.1779906170841014
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a multi-ring structure resembling steroids or terpenes (e.g., **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** with a property of **0.27166989**).
2. **Ketone group (=O)**: Present in one of the rings (similar to many examples, often lowering the property value slightly).
3. **Hydroxyl group (-OH)**: Present at two positions (C1 and C4), which can increase hydrophilicity but may not drastically change the property given the overall hydrophobic core.
4. **Alkyne group (C#C)**: A relatively nonpolar functional group, similar to alkenes (e.g., **C=C** has a property of **0.6182832**).

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** has a property of **0.27166989**. This is a close analog but lacks the alkyne and has one fewer hydroxyl group.
- **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** has a property of **-0.42155672**, but it has more polar groups (additional -F and -C(=O)CO).
- The alkyne (C#C) is less polar than an alkene (C=C), so its contribution may be similar or slightly higher (e.g., **C=C** is **0.6182832**).

### Adjustments:
- The given molecule has **two -OH groups** and **one =O**, which are somewhat balanced by the hydrophobic alkyne and steroid core.
- Compared to **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O (0.27166989)**, the additional -OH and alkyne might slightly increase the property (since -OH is polar but the alkyne is nonpolar).

### Predicted property:
Given the similarities, the property is likely close to **0.27166989** but adjusted slightly upward due to the alkyne. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property: 0.30** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the examples). 

This aligns with the trend where steroid-like structures with moderate polarity fall in this range.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -2.2576704588036023
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as:  
- **Aromaticity**: Highly conjugated or polycyclic aromatic systems (e.g., fused rings like `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54`) tend to have negative values (~ -1.57).  
- **Polar functional groups**: Hydroxyl (`-OH`), carbonyl (`C=O`), and amines (`-NH-`) often reduce the property value (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1` ≈ -0.44).  
- **Halogens (Cl, Br, I, F)**: Increase the value, especially with multiple halogens (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` ≈ 1.22).  
- **Aliphatic chains**: Neutral or slightly positive contributions (e.g., `CCCCOCCO` ≈ 0.79).  

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:  
**`COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67`**  
1. **Structural Features**:  
   - Multiple aromatic rings (but not highly fused polycyclics like in the -1.57 examples).  
   - Polar groups: Ethers (`-O-`), hydroxyls (`-OH`), and a carbonyl (`C=O`).  
   - No halogens or strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `-NO2`, `-SO2-`).  
   - Sugarlike fragments (e.g., `OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)`), which are polar but not strongly negative like carboxylic acids.  

2. **Comparison to Examples**:  
   - Similar to `COc1ccccc1Cl` (0.215) or `OCc1ccccc1` (0.094) but with more polar groups.  
   - The carbonyl and multiple ethers/OH groups would reduce the value slightly, but the lack of fused aromatic systems or strong electron-withdrawing groups prevents very negative values.  

3. **Prediction**:  
   - Likely in the range of **0.0 to 0.2**, closer to the neutral/weakly positive values seen in moderately polar aromatic systems.  

**Final Predicted Property Value**: **0.12** (approximate, based on qualitative trends).  

*Note: Without a clear quantitative model, this is an empirical estimate based on the examples provided.*

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 0.2154623259439123
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: Property = -0.6182832 (nitrophenol)
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: Property = -0.6182832 (same as above, just written differently)
   - **Oc1ccccc1Cl**: This is chlorophenol, structurally similar to nitrophenol but with a Cl substituent instead of NO₂.

2. **Chlorinated Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I**: Property = 1.08667956 (chloroiodobenzene)
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl**: Property = -0.05620756 (dichlorobiphenyl)
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = 1.30214188 (hexachlorobiphenyl)
   - **Clc1cccc2ccccc12**: Property = -0.08431134 (chloronaphthalene)
   - The presence of Cl tends to increase the property value compared to non-halogenated analogs, but the effect depends on the number and position of Cl atoms.

3. **Hydroxy vs. Nitro/Chloro Substitution**:
   - Phenol (**Oc1ccccc1**) itself is not in the examples, but nitrophenol has a value of -0.6182832.
   - Adding Cl (electron-withdrawing like NO₂ but less strongly) might not reduce the value as much as NO₂. However, Cl is less electron-withdrawing than NO₂, so the property might be slightly higher than nitrophenol.

4. **Direct Comparison**:
   - **Fc1ccccc1** (fluorobenzene): Property = 0.06557549
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene): Property = 1.08667956
   - Chlorine is less electronegative than fluorine but adds more to the property value when combined with another halogen (I). For monochlorinated phenol, the value is likely between nitrophenol (-0.618) and chloroiodobenzene (1.086).

5. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I**: Property = 0.83374552 (diiodo-cyanophenol)
   - This suggests that adding halogens (I) and polar groups (CN) increases the property value. Chlorophenol has only one Cl, so the value should be lower than this.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Nitrophenol (strong electron-withdrawing NO₂) has a value of -0.618.
- Fluorobenzene (strong electron-withdrawing F) has a value of 0.065.
- Chloroiodobenzene (Cl + I) has a value of 1.086.
- Chlorine is less electron-withdrawing than NO₂ but more than H, the property for chlorophenol should be higher than nitrophenol but lower than chloroiodobenzene.

A reasonable estimate is slightly above the fluorobenzene value but below the chloroiodobenzene value. Given the trend, **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol) likely has a property value around **-0.1 to 0.2**.

Looking for a precise match in the examples, the closest analog is **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (chloronaphthalene) with -0.08431134. Chlorophenol is simpler, so the value might be slightly higher. 

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is **-0.08431134** (same as chloronaphthalene, as it’s a reasonable midpoint for a monochlorinated aromatic with a polar substituent). 

However, since phenol with NO₂ is -0.618 and phenol with Cl is less electron-withdrawing, a better estimate might be halfway between nitrophenol (-0.618) and fluorobenzene (0.065), giving ~ -0.276. But this contradicts the chloronaphthalene example. 

Given the complexity, the most consistent value from similar examples is **-0.08431134**.

### Adjusted Prediction:
After reconsidering, the value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is likely closer to **-0.1**. Since exact matches aren't present, I'll average nitrophenol (-0.618) and chloronaphthalene (-0.084) to get **-0.351**. But this seems too low. 

Alternatively, the presence of OH (electron-donating) and Cl (electron-withdrawing) might cancel out somewhat, leading to a value near **0.0**. 

Given the examples, the safest bet is to assign the same value as **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (-0.08431134), as it’s the closest structurally.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is **-0.08431134**.

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -0.4215567246728714
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Cl-substituted aromatic ring**: `c1cccc(Cl)c1` (similar to `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)...` in some examples).
   - **Amide linkage**: `OC(=O)N` (similar to `NC(=O)` in examples like `CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1` with property -0.365).
   - **Alkyne group**: `C#C` (not directly in examples, but triple bonds are rare in the dataset).
   - **Chlorinated aliphatic chain**: `ClCC` (similar to `CCCCl` with property 1.133, but here it's shorter and bonded to an alkyne).
   - **Ester-like linkage**: `OC(=O)N` (similar to esters like `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` with property -0.861).

2. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - The molecule has polar groups (Cl, amide, alkyne) and aromaticity, suggesting moderate polarity.
   - Chlorine substituents on the aromatic ring and aliphatic chain may increase hydrophobicity but also introduce dipole moments.

3. **Comparison to Similar Examples**:
   - `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (property: -0.0187): Has multiple halogens and polar groups.
   - `CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1` (property: -0.552): Contains an amide and ether linkage.
   - `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (property: -0.084): Chlorinated aromatic system.
   - `CCCCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (property: -0.552): Similar ester-amide-aromatic combination.

### Prediction:
The molecule combines features of chlorinated aromatics, amides, and alkyne-containing chains. Given the presence of:
- Two Cl atoms (electron-withdrawing),
- An amide group (polar, hydrogen-bonding),
- An alkyne (moderately hydrophobic),
- An ester-like linkage (polar),

the property is likely in the **moderately negative range**, similar to other polar, halogenated, and amide-containing molecules in the dataset. 

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.5 and -0.7**, closer to examples like `CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1` (-0.552) or `CCCCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (-0.552). 

### Final Predicted Value:
**-0.55** (approximate, based on structural similarity to examples with properties around this range). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: -0.9555285759251757
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: The molecule contains three aromatic rings (two benzene rings and one pyridine-like ring with nitrogens, `c2cncnc2`). Aromatic systems are present in many of the examples, and their contribution to the property value depends on substitution patterns.
   - Example: `N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (two benzene rings) has a value of **-0.78690589**.
   - Example: `o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` (fused aromatic rings) has the same value of **-0.78690589**.

2. **Chlorine Substitution**: The molecule has two chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings (`c1ccc(Cl)cc1` and `c3ccccc3Cl`). Chlorine substitution tends to increase the property value when present in large numbers or on aliphatic chains, but on aromatic rings, the effect is less pronounced.
   - Example: `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` (two aromatic Cl) has a value of **0.67449076**.
   - Example: `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` (one aromatic Cl and Br) has a value of **0.85248138**.

3. **Oxygen Substituent**: The molecule has a hydroxyl group (`OC`) attached to a central carbon bonded to the aromatic systems. Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., hydroxyl, ether) often reduce the property value when not part of highly polar or charged groups.
   - Example: `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` (two hydroxyl groups) has a value of **-0.24356611**.
   - Example: `COc1cccc(Cl)c1` (methoxy and Cl) has a value of **0.21546233**.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring**: The `c2cncnc2` ring is a diazine-like structure (similar to pyrimidine). Nitrogen-containing heterocycles often reduce the property value unless heavily substituted with halogens or other electronegative groups.
   - Example: `Nc1nc[nH]n1` (tetrazole-like) has a value of **-0.13115098**.
   - Example: `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (fused nitrogen heterocycles) has a value of **-0.80564174**.

5. **Central Carbon with Aromatic Substitution**: The central carbon bonded to three aromatic systems (two benzene rings and one heterocycle) is sterically crowded, which may slightly reduce the property value due to reduced accessibility for interactions.

### Synthesis of Features:
- The presence of two aromatic chlorines would push the value toward the **0.6-0.8** range (as in `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`).
- The hydroxyl group and nitrogen-containing heterocycle would reduce this, likely bringing it closer to **0.0 to 0.5**.
- The bulky aromatic systems and central carbon may further reduce it slightly.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog is likely `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (value: **0.7588021**), which has more chlorines but a similar aromatic-heavy structure. Our molecule has fewer chlorines but additional nitrogen and oxygen, which would reduce the value compared to this.

### Predicted Value:
Considering all these factors, a reasonable estimate for **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** is:  
**0.24356611**  

This aligns with the balance of aromatic chlorines (increasing the value) and heteroatoms/sterics (decreasing it). The value is similar to `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` but adjusted downward for the additional heterocycle and hydroxyl group.

Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 0.36534916138315576
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with highly polar or electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro groups `N(=O)=O`, halogens like `Br`, `Cl`, or carbonyls `C=O`) tend to have more negative property values.
   - Nonpolar or alkyl-dominated molecules (e.g., `CCCCBr`, `CCCCCC=O`) tend to have positive property values.

2. **Carbon Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer alkyl chains (e.g., `CCCCCC=O`) tend to increase the property value slightly compared to shorter chains (e.g., `CC=O`).
   - Branching or cyclic structures can reduce the property value (e.g., `C1CCCCCCC1` has a lower value than linear chains).

3. **Specific Examples for Comparison**:
   - `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl butyrate) has a property value of **0.36534916**.
   - `CCCCCC=O` (heptanal) has a property value of **0.55270771**.
   - `CC(=O)OCC` (ethyl acetate) is not in the list, but similar esters like `CCCC(=O)OCC` suggest esters with moderate chain lengths have values around **0.3–0.5**.

4. **Butyl Formate (CCCCOC=O)**:
   - This is an ester with a butyl group (`CCCC`) and a formyl group (`OC=O`).
   - Compared to `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl butyrate), the chain length is similar but reversed (butyl formate vs. ethyl butyrate). The formyl group (`OC=O`) is slightly more polar than the `(=O)OCC` group, which might slightly reduce the property value.
   - The property value is likely close to **0.36534916** (ethyl butyrate) but slightly lower due to the formyl group's polarity.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **CCCCOC=O** is approximately **0.35**. 

However, looking more closely at the examples:
- `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl butyrate): **0.36534916**
- `CCCCCC=O` (heptanal): **0.55270771**
- `CC(=O)OCC` (ethyl acetate) is not listed, but similar esters suggest values around **0.3–0.5**.

Since butyl formate (`CCCCOC=O`) is structurally similar to ethyl butyrate but with a slightly more polar formyl group, its value should be slightly lower than **0.36534916**. 

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CCCCOC=O** is **0.35**. 

For precision, I will round to **0.35000000** (though the exact value may vary slightly). 

However, considering the consistency with `CCCC(=O)OCC` (0.365) and the slight polarity increase, a more precise estimate would be **0.35**. 

Thus, the predicted value is:  
**0.35000000** (or approximately **0.35**). 

But to match the precision of the given examples, I will provide:  
**0.35000000**. 

However, looking back at the examples, the closest match is `CCCC(=O)OCC` at **0.36534916**, and since `CCCCOC=O` is very similar, I will predict:  
**0.36534916** (same as `CCCC(=O)OCC` due to structural similarity). 

But given the formyl group's slight polarity increase, a slight reduction is reasonable, so:  
**0.35000000**. 

After reconsidering, the most consistent prediction is:  
**0.36534916** (same as `CCCC(=O)OCC`). 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCCOC=O** is **0.36534916**.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1.4051890822429063
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for **ClCCl** (dichloromethane), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values.

### Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Compounds**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of **1.40518908**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene) has a property value of **1.48950043**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **0.21546233**.
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (chloroaniline) has a property value of **0.21546233** (same as dichlorobenzene, suggesting the amine group doesn't significantly alter the property in this case).

   Chlorinated compounds tend to have **higher positive property values**, especially with more chlorine atoms or simpler aliphatic structures (e.g., ClCCCl).

2. **Aliphatic vs. Aromatic Chlorides**:
   - Aliphatic chlorides (e.g., ClCCCl) have higher values than aromatic chlorides (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1).
   - The property seems to decrease with aromaticity or additional functional groups.

3. **Size and Symmetry**:
   - Smaller, symmetric chlorinated molecules (e.g., ClCCCl) have higher values than larger or asymmetric ones.

### Prediction for ClCCl:
- **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) is a smaller and simpler chlorinated molecule than ClCCCl (1,2-dichloroethane). 
- It has **two chlorines on a single carbon**, making it highly polar and compact, similar to ClCCCl but with even fewer atoms.
- Given that ClCCCl has a value of **1.40518908**, we might expect ClCCl to have a **slightly higher value** due to its smaller size and higher chlorine density.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trend, a reasonable prediction for **ClCCl** is:  
**1.5** (slightly higher than ClCCCl's 1.405).  

However, looking at the examples, the highest value is **1.48950043** (hexachlorobenzene), so we might cap the prediction near that.  

Thus, a refined estimate is:  
**1.45** (between ClCCCl's 1.405 and hexachlorobenzene's 1.49).  

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **ClCCl** is **1.45**.  

*(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or experimental data would be needed.)*

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.05620756328971609
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Hydroxyl (-OH) Groups**:
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1**: Property = -0.24356611
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O**: Property = -0.05620756
   - **c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC**: Property = -0.24356611
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: Property = -0.6182832
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O**: Property = -0.05620756

   Hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings tend to result in negative property values, typically in the range of -0.05 to -0.6, depending on other substituents.

2. **Methyl (-CH3) Substituents**:
   - Methyl groups on aromatic rings (e.g., **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**) often slightly increase the property value compared to unsubstituted or polar-substituted aromatics. For example:
     - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** has a higher value (-0.056) than **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (-0.243).

3. **Similar Structures**:
   - The molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is very similar to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (property = -0.05620756), except that the former has two methyl groups directly on the aromatic ring, while the latter has a branched alkyl group. The additional methyl group in **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** may slightly increase the property (make it less negative) due to increased hydrophobicity.

### Prediction:
Given the similarities to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (-0.056) and the slightly more hydrophobic nature of **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, the predicted property value would be slightly higher (less negative). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property for Cc1cccc(C)c1O: -0.04** (approximate, likely in the range of -0.03 to -0.05). 

However, looking at the exact examples, **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** is already very close, so the value might be nearly identical. For precision, I would predict:

**Predicted property: -0.056** (same as **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O**, as the structural difference is minimal). 

But since **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** has slightly more hydrophobicity, let's adjust slightly upward:

**Final predicted property: -0.04**. 

(Note: Without a clear quantitative trend, this is an educated guess based on the closest examples.)

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.4871322151775409
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question, we can identify patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property value. 

The molecule to predict is:  
**Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**  

This is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) derivative with multiple chlorine substitutions on both phenyl rings. 

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds** tend to have **positive property values**, often greater than 1.0. For example:
   - `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl` → **0.7588021** (hexachlorinated biphenyl-like structure)
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` → **1.03047199** (heptachlorinated biphenyl-like structure)
   - `Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br` → **1.92979301** (pentabrominated benzene, analogous to chlorinated aromatics)
   - `ClCBr` → **1.5831797** (simple halogenated aliphatic, but smaller than aromatic halogens)

2. The **number of chlorines** and **symmetry** seem to increase the property value. The given molecule has **6 chlorines**, similar to the second example above (which has 7 chlorines and a value of **1.03047199**).

3. The **biphenyl core** with chlorines is less polarizable than a fused polyaromatic system (e.g., the naphthalene-like structures in the examples have negative values).

### Prediction:
The molecule is a **hexachlorinated biphenyl**, structurally similar to the second example but with one fewer chlorine. Given the trend:
- The example with 7 chlorines: **1.03047199**
- The example with 6 chlorines (but less symmetric): **0.7588021**

This molecule is symmetric and heavily chlorinated, so its value should be **close to 1.0**, likely slightly lower than the heptachlorinated example but higher than the less symmetric hexachlorinated example.

### Final predicted value:
**0.95** (approximate, based on interpolation of the given examples).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the data. If the property is something like logP or hydrophobicity, this would align well.)  

**Answer: 0.95**
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.6182831961868789
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene or 2-methyl-1,3-butadiene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons with double bonds or branching**:
   - **CCCCC(CC)C=O**: Property = 0.55270771 (branched aldehyde with a double bond in the backbone).
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C**: Property = 0.6182832 (linear hydrocarbon with one double bond).
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**: Property = 0.8618493 (highly branched alkane).
   - **CCCCCCCC**: Property = 0.8618493 (linear alkane).
   - **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C**: Property = 0.0 (complex cyclic ketone with double bonds).

2. **Smaller or less branched hydrocarbons**:
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1**: Property = 0.13115098 (branched aromatic).
   - **Cc1ccccc1C**: Property = 0.13115098 (methyl-substituted aromatic).
   - **COC(=O)C=C**: Property = 0.12178305 (small ester with a double bond).

3. **Molecules with double bonds**:
   - Double bonds tend to reduce the property value slightly compared to their saturated counterparts (e.g., **CCCCCCCCC=C** vs. **CCCCCCCC**).

### Analysis of **CC=C(C)C**:
- This is a small branched hydrocarbon with one double bond (isoprene). 
- It is less branched than **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (property = 0.8618493) but more branched than **CCCCCCCCC=C** (property = 0.6182832).
- The double bond will likely reduce the property value compared to a saturated version (e.g., **CCC(C)C** would likely be higher).
- Comparing to similar-sized molecules:
  - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1**: 0.13115098 (branched aromatic).
  - **COC(=O)C=C**: 0.12178305 (small ester with double bond).

Given the small size, branching, and presence of a double bond, the property value is likely in the range of **0.3 to 0.6**. A reasonable estimate would be close to **0.5**, similar to **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (0.55270771) but slightly lower due to less complexity.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.45** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The property could represent logP, solubility, or another molecular descriptor, but the trend suggests higher values for larger/branched hydrocarbons and lower values for polar/double-bonded systems.)

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1.4051890822429063
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the given molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) in the context of the provided data.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher (more positive) property values. For example:
     - `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a very high value of **1.57381177**.
     - `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) has a value of **1.70496275**.
     - `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` has an even higher value of **2.79164231**.
   - Simpler chlorinated molecules like `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` have a value of **0.48713222**, and `Oc1cccc(Cl)c1` has **0.21546233**.

2. **Small Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - The simplest chlorinated molecule in the examples is `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) with **1.70496275**.
   - `ClCCl` (dichloromethane) is even simpler, with only two chlorines and no other functional groups or complexity.

3. **Trend**:
   - As the number of chlorines increases, the property value increases.
   - Smaller chlorinated molecules (with fewer non-chlorine atoms) tend to have higher values than larger ones with the same number of chlorines.

### Prediction for ClCCl:
- `ClCCl` is a very small molecule with two chlorines and no other functional groups or complexity. 
- Comparing to `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (4 chlorines, value = 1.70496275) and `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (2 chlorines, value = 0.48713222), we can infer that `ClCCl` would have a value somewhere between these, likely higher than `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` because it lacks the oxygen and aromatic ring that might lower the value.
- Given its simplicity and the strong effect of chlorines, a reasonable estimate is slightly higher than `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` but lower than `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl`.

### Predicted Property Value for ClCCl:
**1.20** (This is an approximate interpolation based on the observed trends in the data.) 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the correlation between chlorine substitution and the property values in the given examples.)
==================================================
Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.7588021044111695
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher (more positive) property values. For example:
     - `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **0.7588021**.
     - `Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1` (similarly halogenated but with bromine) has a value of **1.4801325**.
     - `ClCC` has a value of **1.13351919**.
   - This suggests that halogens (especially chlorine) increase the property value.

2. **Phenol-like Structures**:
   - The presence of a hydroxyl group (`OH`) attached to an aromatic ring (phenol) tends to reduce the property value slightly compared to fully halogenated aromatics. For example:
     - `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` (phenol with 3 chlorines) has a value of **0.7588021**.
     - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (not in the dataset, but similar to the target molecule) would likely have a slightly lower value than fully halogenated aromatics.

3. **Target Molecule**:
   - The target molecule is **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, which is a phenol with three chlorine substituents (two meta and one para to the hydroxyl group). This is very similar to `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` (value = 0.7588021), but with a slightly different substitution pattern (the chlorine atoms are adjacent in the given example, while in the target, they are separated by a carbon).

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` (value = 0.7588021), the target molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** should have a very close value. The slight difference in substitution pattern (chlorines not adjacent) might reduce the value marginally, but the effect is likely small. 

Thus, the predicted property value is approximately:  
**0.75** (rounded from ~0.758). 

For consistency with the given data, we can provide a more precise estimate:  
**0.7588021** (same as the very similar example). 

However, if we account for the slight difference in substitution (chlorines not adjacent), the value might be marginally lower, e.g., **0.74**. 

Given the data, the most reasonable answer is:  
**0.7588021** (same as the nearly identical example). 

### Final Answer:
**0.7588021**

Iteration: 96
SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -2.2576704588036023
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group contributions. The molecule in question is complex, with multiple functional groups including ethers (OCH3), hydroxyls (OH), a ketone (C=O), and a furan-like structure (OCO in a ring). 

Breaking it down:
1. The presence of multiple polar groups (OH, OCH3, C=O) suggests a negative contribution to the property value (as seen in other polar molecules like those with NO2 or SO2 groups).
2. The aromatic rings with oxygen substituents (e.g., OCH3 and OH) are similar to some of the examples with negative values (e.g., `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` with -0.618).
3. The large size and complexity of the molecule might moderate the effect, but the high polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity likely dominate.

Comparing to similar examples:
- Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` has -2.089, but this is extreme due to multiple amides and aromatic rings).
- Simpler polyols or sugars (e.g., `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` has +0.449) but this lacks aromaticity and has fewer polar groups.

Given the balance of aromaticity, polar groups, and size, a reasonable estimate would be **-0.55 to -0.75**. 

**Predicted property value: -0.65** (interpolating between similar examples).

Iteration: 97
SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.1124151265794324
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** with a **thiomethyl (CS) group**, a **carbonyl (=O)**, and an **amino (NH)** group. It also has a bulky **tert-butyl (C(C)(C)C)** substituent.
2. **Polarity**: The presence of **S, N, and O** atoms suggests moderate polarity, but the bulky tert-butyl group may reduce overall polarity.
3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1** (property: **-0.37471709**): This is a similar pyrimidone-like structure with an NH group and a carbonyl. The property is moderately negative.
   - **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property: **-0.27166989**): This has a similar thiazole-like ring with a tert-butyl group and carbonyl. The property is slightly negative.
   - **Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property: **-0.80564174**): This is a more polar, fused heterocycle with multiple nitrogens, leading to a more negative value.

### Key Observations:
- The tert-butyl group tends to **reduce polarity** (less negative property).
- The **thiomethyl (CS)** group is less polar than oxygen but more polar than pure hydrocarbons.
- The **carbonyl and NH** groups add some polarity but are balanced by the bulky tert-butyl.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarities to **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property: **-0.27166989**) but with slightly less polarity due to the replacement of oxygen with sulfur, the predicted property should be **slightly less negative**.

**Final Prediction: -0.25**  
*(This is an estimate based on structural analogies and trends in the given data.)*

Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.36534916138315554
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) often have negative property values unless balanced by polar or aliphatic groups. For example:
     - `o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` (two fused aromatic rings): -0.78690589
     - `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (two aromatic rings): -0.78690589
     - `c1ccc2cnccc2c1` (aromatic with nitrogen): -0.42155672
   - A single aromatic ring with no strongly polar groups tends to have a less negative value (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1`: -0.05620756).

2. **Ester Groups (-COOR)**:
   - Esters (R-COO-R') often have moderately positive or near-zero values unless combined with other negative contributors (e.g., aromatic rings or electronegative atoms). For example:
     - `CCCC(=O)OCC`: 0.36534916
     - `CCCCCC(=O)OC`: 0.36534916
     - `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2`: -1.72369861 (due to additional negative contributors like S=O, Cl, and aromatic systems).

3. **Combination of Aromatic + Ester**:
   - The molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is an ester (`CCOC=O`) attached to a benzene ring (`c1ccccc1`). 
   - From the examples, similar structures with an aromatic ring + ester have:
     - `Cc1cccc2c1Cc3ccccc32` (aromatic + aliphatic): -0.59954734
     - `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (aromatic + carbonyl): -0.73069832
   - The ester group alone would push the value toward ~0.36, but the aromatic ring pulls it negative. A reasonable compromise is slightly negative.

4. **No Strongly Electronegative Groups**:
   - The molecule lacks strongly electronegative groups (e.g., NO2, SO3H, multiple halogens) that would make the value more negative.

### Prediction:
Given the aromatic ring (-0.5 to -0.7 effect) and the ester group (~+0.3 effect), the net property value is likely slightly negative. A reasonable estimate is **-0.43**, similar to `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (-0.43092465) or `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (-0.43092465), which also combine aromatic rings with moderately polar groups.

### Final Answer:
**-0.43092465**
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 1.3115098100933793
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities with other molecules. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Comparison with similar molecules**:
   - **CCCCCCCO** (1-heptanol) has a property value of **0.82437759**.
   - **CI** (methyl iodide) has a property value of **1.54570799**.
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a property value of **0.09367927**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (a polychlorinated biphenyl) has a property value of **0.21546233**.

2. **Key observations**:
   - The presence of a **bromine atom (Br)** tends to increase the property value compared to non-halogenated hydrocarbons, but less so than iodine (as seen in **CI**).
   - Longer alkyl chains (like **CCCCCCCO**) have higher property values than shorter ones, likely due to increased hydrophobicity or molecular size.
   - The property value for **CCCCCCCBr** should be somewhat lower than **CCCCCCCO** because Br is less polar than OH but higher than a pure hydrocarbon or a less polar substituent.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is likely between **0.6 and 0.8**, closer to **CCCCCCCO** but slightly lower due to the less polar nature of Br compared to OH.
   - A reasonable estimate is **~0.75**, but looking at the examples, a more precise value might be **0.71196247** (similar to **OCC(O)C(O)CO**, though this is not a perfect match).
   - Alternatively, interpolating between **CCCCCCCO (0.82437759)** and **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (0.09367927)**, we might expect **~0.6-0.7**.

Given the data, the most plausible prediction is:  
**0.71196247** (same as **OCC(O)C(O)CO**, as Br and OH have some similarities in contribution to the property).

However, if we consider that Br is less polar than OH but still significant, a slightly lower value like **0.68** might also be reasonable. But based on the exact examples, the closest match is likely:  
**Predicted property value: 0.71196247**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)  

**Final answer: 0.71196247**
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 0.8243775949158385
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule **CO (methanol)**, I can predict the property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. 

### Observations:
1. **Small, polar molecules with an -OH group** (e.g., alcohols) tend to have property values in the **positive range** but not extremely high (e.g., not as high as halogenated compounds like CCl4 or CBr4).
   - Example:  
     - `CCC(C)CO` (2-butanol) → **0.82437759**  
     - `OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O` (sugar-like polyol) → **0.63701905**  
     - `CC(O)c1ccccc1` (phenyl ethanol) → **0.09367927**  
     - `CCCCOC=O` (butyl formate) → **0.36534916**  

2. **Methanol (CO)** is even simpler than these examples, with just one carbon and an -OH group. It lacks additional hydrophobic (e.g., aromatic rings, long alkyl chains) or strongly polar (e.g., nitro groups, multiple halogens) features that would push the value significantly higher or lower.

3. The smallest alcohol in the dataset is `CCC` (propane, no -OH), which has a value of **0.8618493**, but methanol is more polar due to the -OH group.  

### Prediction:
Given its simplicity and polarity, **methanol (CO)** would likely have a property value **between 0.3 and 0.8**, closer to small alcohols like `CCC(C)CO` (0.824) but slightly lower due to its smaller size.  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value for CO: ~0.6**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on trends in the data.)  

---
**Final answer: ~0.6** (e.g., **0.63701905**, matching the sugar-alcohol value, as methanol is similarly polar but smaller).  

---
If you can clarify the property (e.g., logP, dipole moment, etc.), I could refine this further!
