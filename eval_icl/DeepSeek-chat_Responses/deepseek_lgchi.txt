SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.4379343166126474
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the analysis:

1. **Long hydrocarbon chains** (e.g., `CCCCCC`, `CCCCCC(C)C`) tend to have **negative property values**, especially when they are non-polar and lack functional groups. For example:
   - `CCCCCC` → -0.20803624  
   - `CCCCCC(C)C` → -1.43030931  

2. **Ester groups (`=O)OC`)** tend to **increase the property value** when attached to hydrocarbon chains. For example:
   - `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (similar to `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` in the examples) → 0.33846704  

3. The **length of the hydrocarbon chain** also plays a role. Longer chains with esters still retain a **moderate positive value**, as seen in:
   - `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` → 0.33846704  

### Prediction for `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`:
This molecule has a **long hydrocarbon chain (10 carbons) with an ester group**, similar to the example `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (which has a property value of **0.33846704**).  

Since the structure is nearly identical (only differing in chain length by 2 carbons, which is unlikely to drastically change the property given the trends), the predicted property value should be **close to the example**.  

### Final Predicted Value:
**0.34** (approximated from the similar example).  

*(Note: If exact precision is required, the value would be* **0.33846704**, *matching the given example.)*

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.7747640143780357
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **benzofuran-2-one-like** structure (a benzene fused to a lactone/cyclic amide) with a **chlorine substituent** on the benzene ring. Specifically:
   - A benzene ring (`c2ccc...c2`) fused to a 5-membered ring (`oc(=O)[nH]c1`).
   - The 5-membered ring has a **lactam-like** group (`oc(=O)[nH]`), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (donor/acceptor).

2. **Substituents**:
   - Chlorine (`Cl`) on the benzene ring: Chlorine is electronegative and tends to increase the property value when present (see examples like `ClC=C` with a high value of 0.84 or `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` with 0.10).
   - The `oc(=O)[nH]` group is electron-withdrawing and polar, likely reducing the property value (similar to other polar groups like `NC(=O)` or `O=C1NC(=O)...` in the examples, which often correlate with negative or low-positive values).

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **chlorine + polar groups** (e.g., `Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` with -2.045, `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` with -0.383) tend to have negative values due to the combined effect of halogens and polar moieties.
   - Molecules with **fused aromatic + polar heterocycles** (e.g., `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)` with -0.439, `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)` with 0.491) show moderate to low values depending on the polarity.
   - The presence of **hydrogen-bond donors (`[nH]`)** and acceptors (`C=O`) typically lowers the property value (e.g., `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` with -0.104).

### Prediction:
Given the combination of:
- A **chlorine substituent** (increases value slightly),
- A **fused polar heterocycle** with hydrogen bonding (decreases value significantly),
- No strongly hydrophobic/aliphatic regions (which might offset the polarity),

the property value is likely **moderately negative**, similar to other polar heterocycles with halogens. 

Looking at the closest analogs:
- `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)` (0.491) is too high (no chlorine, more symmetry).
- `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (-0.383) is somewhat close but has two chlorines.
- `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)` (-0.439) is a good match for the polar heterocycle effect.

Thus, a reasonable estimate is between **-0.4 and -0.6**. 

### Final Prediction:
**-0.45** (specific value chosen based on balancing the chlorine and polar heterocycle effects). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.5334515877445639
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitrogen-containing functional groups**:
   - **Nc1nccs1** (thiazole with NH2): **0.16865499**
   - **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (fluorinated pyrimidine): **0.30392071**
   - **NC(=O)CCl**: **0.59527863** (amide with chloro)
   - **N(=O)=O (nitro groups)**:
     - **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO**: **-0.80611042** (nitro group on a heterocycle)
     - Nitro groups tend to lower the property value unless balanced by other features.

2. **Alkyl groups**:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., **CCCOCC**): **0.12276709**
   - Branched alkanes (e.g., **CCC(C)CC**): **-0.11609103**
   - **CC(C)N(=O)=O** has a branched alkyl group (isopropyl) attached to a nitro group.

3. **Electron-withdrawing vs. electron-donating effects**:
   - Nitro (**N(=O)=O**) is strongly electron-withdrawing, which may reduce the property value.
   - Branched alkyl groups (e.g., isopropyl) are weakly electron-donating but not enough to counteract the nitro group's effect.

4. **Similar molecules**:
   - **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** (nitro group on a heterocycle with alkyl and ether): **-0.80611042**
   - **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is simpler (no heterocycle) but has a similar nitro + branched alkyl combination.

### Prediction:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group and the presence of a branched alkyl group, the property value is likely **negative** and moderately low. Comparing to similar nitro-containing compounds, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O: -0.75**  
*(This is an educated guess based on the trends in the data, likely between -0.5 and -1.0.)*  

### Justification:
- Nitro groups consistently reduce the property value (e.g., **-0.80611042** for a nitro-heterocycle).
- Branched alkanes alone are slightly negative (e.g., **-0.11609103** for **CCC(C)CC**).
- The combination suggests a value closer to the nitro-heterocycle example but less negative due to the absence of additional polar/aromatic features.

Thus, **-0.75** is a plausible prediction.

Iteration: 4
SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 1.520098495299088
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and the presence of carbonyl groups or other polar moieties. 

The molecule to predict is:  
**CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**

### Key observations about this molecule:
1. **Steroid-like structure**: The molecule has a polycyclic framework resembling steroids or terpenes (e.g., **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C**, which has a property value of **1.4621774**).  
2. **Functional groups**:  
   - Two carbonyl groups (C=O): one in a ring (like the example above) and one in a side chain (C(=O)CO).  
   - A hydroxyl group (OH), which is polar but not as strongly electron-withdrawing as halogens or nitro groups.  
3. **No halogens or strongly electron-withdrawing groups**: Unlike some of the highly negative-valued examples (e.g., halogenated aromatics), this lacks such groups.  
4. **Similarity to high-value examples**: The closest analog is **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (value: **1.4621774**), which also has a steroid-like core and carbonyl groups.  

### Adjustments for differences:
- The additional **C(=O)CO** side chain introduces extra polarity but is less rigid than the cyclic carbonyl in the reference example.  
- The **OH group** adds polarity but may not significantly increase the property value compared to the reference.  

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to the example with **1.4621774**, but with slightly less rigidity due to the side chain, the predicted value would be **slightly lower**.  

**Final predicted property value: ~1.35** (likely in the range of **1.3 to 1.4**).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, dipole moment, or a quantum-chemical descriptor—this is an educated guess based on trends in the data.)

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.2125270721156721
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). Aromatic rings with halogens are present in many examples, and their contributions vary based on the halogen type and position.
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a value of **-0.24554587**.
   - Example: **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** has a value of **-0.05079107** (fluorine tends to reduce the magnitude compared to chlorine).

2. **Amide Groups**: The molecule has two amide groups (**C(=O)NC(=O)N**), which are polar and can form hydrogen bonds. Amide-containing molecules in the dataset:
   - **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** has a value of **-0.63186922** (thioamide, but structurally similar).
   - **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** has a value of **0.11476005** (amide with a heterocycle).

3. **Halogen Substituents**: 
   - Fluorine substituents (**Fc1cccc(F)c1**) are less electron-withdrawing than chlorine but still contribute to polarity.
   - Chlorine substituent (**Clc2ccc(Cl)cc2**) is present, similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (-0.24554587).

4. **Overall Polarity and Size**: The molecule is larger and more polar than many examples, but not as large as some of the very high-value examples (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**, value **2.12399594**).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog might be **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (-0.24554587) or **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (-0.63186922), but with additional fluorine and amide groups.
- The presence of two amides and fluorines likely reduces the property value further (more negative) compared to simple halogenated aromatics.
- However, the extended conjugation and polarity might partially offset this.

### Predicted Value:
Given the above, the property value is likely in the range of **-0.5 to -1.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.75**  

This balances the contributions from the halogens, amides, and aromatic systems.

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.18307360498508976
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl propyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - Molecules with ether linkages tend to have moderate to low property values, often in the range of -0.5 to 0.5. For example:
     - `CCOC(=O)CC` (ethyl propanoate, not an ether but contains -O-) has a value of **0.14103779**.
     - `OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O` (a complex ether) has a high value of **1.54861905**, but this is likely due to other dominant features like multiple hydroxyl groups and aromaticity.
     - Simpler ethers like `CCCOC(C)C` are expected to have lower values.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Linear or slightly branched aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCCO`, pentanol) have values around **0.10080568**.
   - Branching (e.g., `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O`, 2,2,4-trimethyl-3-pentanol) reduces the property value to **-0.43051803**.
   - The molecule `CCCOC(C)C` is branched (isopropyl group) but not as heavily as some examples, so the value should be slightly negative but not extremely low.

3. **Polarity and Functional Groups**:
   - Ethers are polar but lack strong hydrogen bonding (unlike alcohols or acids). This reduces their property values compared to more polar groups.
   - No strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups are present in `CCCOC(C)C`, so the value should be modest.

4. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `CCCCO` (butanol) has a value of **0.10080568**, but `CCCOC(C)C` is less polar due to the ether linkage and branching, so the value should be lower.
   - `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` (a branched hydrocarbon) has a value of **-1.85884382**, but `CCCOC(C)C` has an oxygen, which should raise the value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

### Prediction:
Given the above trends, `CCCOC(C)C` is a branched ether with moderate polarity and no strong additional functional groups. Its value is likely in the range of **-0.2 to -0.6**. 

A reasonable estimate is **-0.3**, but looking at similar examples like `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (-0.43051803) and `CCCCCO` (0.10080568), I would predict a value closer to **-0.4** for `CCCOC(C)C`.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCOC(C)C** is **-0.42**. 

*(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or experimental data would be needed.)*

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: -0.5385914519827391
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **bromine (Br)** substituent, which is electronegative and often associated with negative property values (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has -0.245, `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` has -2.229).
   - It has a **hydantoin-like core** (two carbonyls and an NH group in a 5-membered ring), which is polar and can influence the property. Examples with similar polar cores (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` has -4.891) tend to have negative values.
   - An **alkyl group (CCC(C))** is attached, which is hydrophobic and may slightly offset the polarity.

2. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (property = -2.229): Contains Br and polar amide, similar to our target's polarity and Br.
   - `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3` (property = -0.924): Aromatic and polar, but less polar than our target.
   - `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)CC=C` (property = -1.502): Similar hydantoin core with alkyl groups, but no Br.

3. **Expected Property**:
   - The presence of Br and the highly polar hydantoin-like core will likely push the property to a **negative value**.
   - The alkyl group may moderate the effect slightly compared to purely polar/Br-containing molecules.
   - Given the examples, a reasonable estimate would be between **-1.5 and -2.5**.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-1.85**  
*(This is an educated guess based on the trends observed in the examples, particularly balancing the effects of Br, the polar core, and the alkyl group.)*

Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -2.5798880090938194
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have moderate negative values (e.g., **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** = -0.614, **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** = -2.737). 
   - Larger conjugated systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatics) tend to have higher (less negative or positive) values (e.g., **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** = 1.171, **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** = 0.369).

2. **Biphenyl-like Structures**:
   - The molecule **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a naphthalene derivative with extended conjugation) has a value of **0.369**.
   - The molecule **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (a large polycyclic aromatic) has a value of **1.171**.
   - Biphenyl (**c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2**) is simpler than these but has two conjugated benzene rings, which likely increases the property value compared to single-ring aromatics.

3. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2, Cl) tend to lower the property value (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** = -4.166).
   - Biphenyl has no substituents, so the value should reflect the pure conjugated system.

### Prediction:
Biphenyl is a conjugated system of two benzene rings, which increases delocalization compared to single-ring aromatics but is less extended than larger polycyclic systems. Based on the examples:
- Single-ring aromatics: ~ -0.6 to -2.7.
- Larger fused systems: ~ 0.3 to 1.2.
- Biphenyl is intermediate, likely closer to the lower end of the fused systems.

The closest analog is **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (0.369), which is a naphthalene derivative. Biphenyl is less conjugated than naphthalene but more than benzene, so I estimate a slightly lower value.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.25** (moderate positive value due to conjugation, but not as high as larger fused systems). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on the trend of increasing values with conjugation size.)

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.004703355839935056
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCS** (butyl mercaptan or 1-butanethiol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aliphatic Chains**: 
   - **CCCC(=C)C** (a branched alkene) has a value of **0.17462922**.
   - **CCC1CCCCC1** (cyclohexane with a propyl substituent) has a value of **-1.91395127**.
   - **CCCCCC(C)C** (a branched alkane) has a value of **-1.43030931**.
   - **CCCCCCCC=C** (a linear alkene) has a value of **-2.30878216**.
   - **CCCC(C)(C)C** (a highly branched alkane) has a value of **-0.3475377**.

   Aliphatic chains generally have values in the range of **-2 to +0.5**, with branching tending to increase the value slightly compared to linear chains.

2. **Sulfur-Containing Compounds**:
   - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O** (a complex thiophosphate) has a value of **0.95783168**.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (an ester with no sulfur) has a value of **-1.41564931**.
   - **CCNC(=S)NCC** (a thiourea derivative) has a value of **-0.53615244**.
   - **Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1** (a thioamide) has a value of **-0.18984667**.

   Sulfur-containing groups (e.g., thiols, thiocarbonyls) tend to increase the property value compared to similar non-sulfur compounds, but the effect depends on the specific functional group and context.

3. **Thiols (R-SH)**:
   - No direct examples of simple thiols are provided, but **CCCCS** is a simple aliphatic thiol. Given that sulfur increases the value and linear aliphatic chains tend to have negative values, we can infer that **CCCCS** will likely have a value slightly higher than a similar alkane but still in the negative range.

### Prediction for **CCCCS**:
- The linear alkane **CCCCCC** (hexane) is not in the examples, but similar alkanes like **CCCC(C)(C)C** have values around **-0.35**. 
- Adding a thiol group (**-SH**) would likely increase the value due to the presence of sulfur, but not drastically (since **CCNC(=S)NCC** is only **-0.536**).
- **CCCCS** is a linear thiol, so its value should be slightly higher than a similar alkane but still negative. 

Given the trends, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCS** is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.45**

### Justification:
- Similar alkanes: ~ -0.3 to -1.9 (depending on branching and length).
- Sulfur adds a slight positive bump (e.g., **-0.536** for **CCNC(=S)NCC**).
- Thus, **CCCCS** (linear thiol) would likely fall between **-0.3 and -0.6**.

Final answer: **-0.45** (approximate).

Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.5323237830605594
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Branching and Aliphatic Chains**: 
   - Highly branched aliphatic chains tend to have lower (more negative) property values. For example:
     - `CCC(C)(C)C` has a value of **0.07448592** (moderately branched).
     - `CC(C)CC(C)O` has a value of **-0.11499536** (more branched with an -OH group).
     - `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` has a value of **-1.85884382** (highly branched).
   - The presence of an **-OH group** (hydroxyl) tends to decrease the property value further, especially in branched alkanes.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **-OH groups** generally reduce the property value (e.g., `CC(C)CC(C)O` = **-0.11499536** vs. `CCC(C)(C)C` = **0.07448592**).
   - Longer aliphatic chains with branching and -OH groups (e.g., `CCCC(C)(O)CC` = **-0.67499262**) show more negative values.

3. **Specific Case for CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
   - This is a branched aliphatic chain with a **primary -OH group** and significant branching (tert-butyl-like structure).
   - Similar molecules:
     - `CCCC(C)(O)CC` = **-0.67499262** (branched with -OH).
     - `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` = **-1.85884382** (highly branched, no -OH).
   - The -OH group here is primary (less polar than secondary/tertiary -OH), so the reduction in property value may not be as drastic as in `CCCC(C)(O)CC`.

### Prediction:
Given the branching and the primary -OH group, the property value for **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is expected to be **between -0.5 and -1.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.75**  

This balances the effects of branching (which would push the value lower) and the primary -OH (which has a moderate reducing effect). 

### Justification:
- Less negative than `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (-0.67) because the -OH here is primary (less polar influence).
- More negative than `CC(C)CC(C)O` (-0.11) due to greater branching.  
- Much less negative than `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` (-1.86) because the -OH group partially offsets the branching effect.  

Thus, **-0.75** is a plausible prediction.

Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -1.5475366566517652
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is a **methyl-substituted naphthalene** (specifically, 1-methylnaphthalene). It consists of a naphthalene core (two fused benzene rings) with a methyl group attached to one of the rings.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple benzene (**c1ccccc1**) has a property value of **0.41993126**.
   - Adding a methyl group to benzene (**Cc1ccccc1**) reduces the value slightly (not directly given, but similar to **Cc1cccc(C)c1C** with -0.54839012).
   - Naphthalene-like structures (two fused rings) tend to have lower values than benzene, especially when substituted.

2. **Substituted Naphthalenes**:
   - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (a dimethylnaphthalene) has a very low value of **-5.09261679**.
   - **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is similar but with only one methyl group, so we expect a higher (less negative) value than -5.09261679.

3. **Methyl Group Effects**:
   - Methyl groups generally reduce the property value (more negative) compared to unsubstituted analogs, but the effect is not extreme unless multiple substitutions are present.

4. **Other Fused Ring Systems**:
   - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (a methyl-substituted anthracene/phenanthrene-like structure) has a value of **-0.61451777**.
   - This suggests that adding more fused rings or substitutions further reduces the value.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Naphthalene (unsubstituted) would likely have a value slightly lower than benzene (e.g., ~0.2 to -0.2, but no exact example is provided).
- Adding one methyl group to naphthalene (**Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**) would reduce the value further, but not as drastically as adding two methyl groups (which gave -5.09261679).

From the examples, the closest analog is **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (-0.61451777), which has more fused rings. Since our target has fewer fused rings (just naphthalene + methyl), its value should be less negative. 

Another close example is **Cc1cccc(C)c1C** (-0.54839012), which is a dimethylbenzene. Our target is a monomethylnaphthalene, so we might expect a value in the same ballpark but slightly higher (less negative).

### Final Estimate:
Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is:
**-0.45** (rounded to two decimal places).

### Exact Value:
After carefully weighing the examples, the predicted property value for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is:
**-0.48**. 

This accounts for the naphthalene core's slight reduction compared to benzene and the modest effect of a single methyl group.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: -0.07689456036196428
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic urea derivative with two carbonyl groups. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **-1.46118461**.
   - The core is polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (due to NH and C=O groups), which may lower hydrophobicity or partition coefficients.

2. **Substituents**:
   - The hydantoin core is substituted with a **C(C)CCC** group (a branched alkyl chain) and a **CC=C** group (an alkenyl chain).
   - The **C(C)CCC** group adds hydrophobicity, but the **CC=C** introduces slight polarity due to the double bond.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The closest analog is **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (property = -1.46118461). Here, the substituent is just **CC=C** and a methyl group.
   - The new molecule has a longer/branched alkyl chain (**C(C)CCC**), which is more hydrophobic than a methyl group but less hydrophobic than purely aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCCCCCCCC** with property = 0.61289518).
   - The presence of the double bond (**CC=C**) slightly offsets the hydrophobicity.

4. **Trends**:
   - Cyclic ureas/hydantoins with small alkyl groups tend to have negative property values (e.g., -1.461 for the simpler analog).
   - Longer/branched alkyl chains increase the property value (less negative), but the double bond and polar core keep it from becoming positive.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** but with a more hydrophobic substituent (**C(C)CCC**), the property value should be **less negative** than -1.46118461 but still negative. A reasonable estimate would be slightly higher, around **-1.2**.

However, looking at other examples:
- **CC=C(C(=CC)c1ccc(O)cc1)c2ccc(O)cc2** (with polar groups and double bonds) has a property of 0.44534194.
- **CC1=CCC(CC1)C(C)=C** (purely hydrocarbon with double bonds) has -2.23765854.

Given that the hydantoin core is more polar than these, and the substituents are moderately hydrophobic, a value closer to the original hydantoin example but adjusted for the longer chain seems appropriate.

### Final Prediction:
**-1.3** (approximate interpolation based on the examples). 

However, since the original hydantoin with a smaller substituent was -1.461, and this has a larger but not fully hydrophobic substituent, a more precise guess would be **-1.35**. 

But to match the precision of the given examples, I'll round to:  
**-1.35000000**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data. If the property is logP or similar, this aligns with the polarity/hydrophobicity balance.) 

---

**Answer:** The predicted property value for **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C** is approximately **-1.35**. 

(For higher precision, you might refine this further, but this is a reasonable estimate given the data.)

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.05079107348863629
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

---

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings (Benzene)**: 
   - Simple benzene derivatives (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) are not explicitly listed, but substituted benzenes show varying property values depending on the substituents.
   - Example: `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` has a value of **-1.1775318**, while `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has **0.63682616**, suggesting halogens can influence the property in both directions.

2. **Fluorine Substituents**: 
   - No direct examples of fluorine-substituted benzenes are provided, but halogens (Cl, Br, I) are present in some molecules. Fluorine is more electronegative and may have a distinct effect.
   - Example: `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` has **-1.1775318**, while `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` has **-0.31397969**. Fluorine's stronger electronegativity might push the value further negative or moderate it.

3. **Trifluoromethyl Group (-CF3)**:
   - No direct examples of -CF3 are given, but it is a strongly electron-withdrawing group. Analogous groups like carbonyls (e.g., `C(=O)`) often correlate with more negative values (e.g., `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` has **1.4621774**, but this is a complex steroid).
   - Simpler carbonyl-containing molecules like `COC(=O)c1cccnc1` have **-0.1319181**, suggesting electron-withdrawing groups may reduce the property value.

4. **Alkyl vs. Polar Groups**:
   - Non-polar alkyl chains (e.g., `CCCCC`) tend to have positive values (**0.17462922**), while polar or functionalized molecules (e.g., `CCO` with **0.8552223**) vary widely.
   - The presence of multiple halogens or electronegative atoms often lowers the value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` has **0.09597169**).

---

### Prediction for `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1`:
- The molecule is **trifluoromethylbenzene**, with a highly electron-withdrawing -CF3 group attached to a benzene ring.
- Based on the examples:
  - Halogenated benzenes (Cl, Br) tend to have negative or near-zero values.
  - The -CF3 group is even more electron-withdrawing than halogens, likely pushing the value further negative.
  - No strong electron-donating groups are present to offset this effect.

Given these trends, the predicted property value for `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` would likely be **moderately negative**, similar to or slightly more negative than halogenated benzenes like `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (**-1.1775318**).

---

### Final Prediction:
**-1.25** (estimated based on analogous halogenated benzene examples and the strong electron-withdrawing effect of -CF3). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -1.0025810597318388
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, aromaticity, and functional group composition. The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar derivative (a hexose sugar like glucose or mannitol, but with all hydroxyl groups intact and no anomeric center). 

Key observations from the examples:
1. Highly polar molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., *OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO*, property = **-0.87093697**) tend to have negative or moderately low property values.
2. The presence of aromatic rings or conjugated systems often increases the property value (e.g., *c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2*, property = **-2.57988801** for biphenyl, which is non-polar).
3. The molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** has **five hydroxyl groups** and a cyclic ether, making it very polar and capable of extensive hydrogen bonding, similar to *OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO* but with a ring structure.

Given the strong similarity to *OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO* (property = **-0.87093697**), but with slightly more constrained geometry due to the ring, I would predict a **slightly less negative** property value due to reduced conformational flexibility (rings often have less entropy than chains). 

### Predicted property value: **-0.75** (approximate, likely between -0.7 and -0.8). 

This is based on the trend that cyclic polyols (like this one) are less negative than their acyclic counterparts but still strongly polar.

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 1.6582081932255053
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group composition. The molecule in question is a steroid derivative with multiple functional groups, including ketones, hydroxyl groups, and an ester. 

Breaking it down:
1. **Steroid backbone**: The presence of a steroid core (e.g., `CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C`) is associated with moderate to high property values in the examples (e.g., `1.37693776` for `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` and `1.61388474` for `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C`).
2. **Functional groups**: 
   - The molecule has two ketone groups (`CC(=O)O` and `CC(=O)C`), which are polar and may increase the property value.
   - It also has a hydroxyl group (`C3(O)`), which adds polarity.
   - The ester group (`CC(=O)OCC(=O)`) is polar and may further increase the value.
3. **Comparison to similar structures**:
   - The steroid core with ketones and hydroxyl groups in the examples tends to yield values between `1.0` and `1.6`.
   - The ester group is not present in the examples, but esters are polar and may push the value higher.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for `CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C` is likely in the range of **1.5 to 1.8**. 

A precise estimate based on the closest analogs (e.g., `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` with a value of `1.61388474`) suggests a value of **~1.65**. 

### Final predicted property value: **1.65** (rounded to two decimal places).

Iteration: 16
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 1.353770348890296
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and overall polarity/hydrophobicity. The molecule in question is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, an alcohol group (-OH), and a ketone (=O). 

Breaking it down:
1. **Rings and branching**: The molecule has a complex polycyclic structure (4 fused rings), which tends to lower the property value (as seen with other multi-ring systems like `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` with -1.844 or `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` with +1.058). 
2. **Functional groups**: 
   - The **ketone (=O)** is present, which often increases the property (e.g., `CCOC(=O)C` has +0.470). 
   - The **alcohol (-OH)** is also present, which can have mixed effects but often increases polarity (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` has +0.032, while `CCCCCC(O)CC` has -2.144, but the latter is less complex).
3. **Comparison to similar structures**: 
   - The closest example is `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (property +1.058), which shares the steroid-like backbone and -OH group. 
   - The additional ketone (=O) in the new molecule may slightly increase the property further.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O** is likely in the range of **1.2 to 1.4**. 

A refined estimate based on the examples would be:  
**Predicted property value: 1.25** (approximating the influence of the ketone and the structural similarity to the example with +1.058). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an empirical estimate based on trends in the data.)

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.0966367634883794
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH₃-CO-NH-)**: Present in the molecule (CC(=O)N-).
   - **Nitro group (-NO₂)**: Attached to the benzene ring (N(=O)=O).
   - **Aromatic ring**: Substituted with both acetamide and nitro groups.

2. **Similar Molecules in Examples**:
   - **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (property: -0.248): Contains an aldehyde and methoxy group on benzene.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1** (property: 0.117): Nitrobenzene (simpler nitro-aromatic).
   - **O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12** (property: -1.837): Nitronaphthalene (more conjugated, lower value).
   - **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1** (property: -0.149): Amide with aliphatic chain.
   - **O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2** (property: -0.192): Nitro-substituted heterocycle with amide.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Nitro groups tend to decrease the property value (e.g., nitrobenzene is 0.117, nitronaphthalene is -1.837).
   - Amides (e.g., acetamide-like structures) often have values in the range of -0.1 to -0.3 unless other strong electron-withdrawing/donating groups are present.
   - The molecule is a nitro-substituted aromatic amide, similar to nitrobenzene but with an additional electron-withdrawing acetamide group.

4. **Prediction**:
   - The nitro group alone (as in nitrobenzene) gives ~0.117.
   - Adding the acetamide group (electron-withdrawing) will likely reduce the value further, but not as drastically as in highly conjugated systems (e.g., nitronaphthalene).
   - A reasonable estimate would be slightly negative, around **-0.2 to -0.4**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the examples and structural similarity to nitrobenzene with an additional acetamide group, the predicted property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is:

**-0.312** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

This aligns with the observed range for nitro-aromatics with moderate additional electron-withdrawing effects.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 1.7292589465498827
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S)(OCC)SC)**: This is a relatively polar and bulky group. Similar phosphoryl or thiophosphoryl groups are not directly present in the examples, but polar/charged groups (e.g., esters, amides) tend to increase the property value when combined with aromatic systems.
2. **Aromatic System with Cl Substituent (n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12)**: 
   - The molecule contains a fused aromatic system (benzofuran-like) with a chlorine substituent. 
   - From the examples, chlorine substituents on aromatic rings tend to decrease the property value (e.g., `Clc1cccc2ccccc12` has a value of -1.76373558, `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` has -0.7972813).
   - However, the presence of a carbonyl (=O) in the heterocycle (like in `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`, which has -2.52749224) suggests a further decrease.
3. **Ethoxy Groups (OCC)**: These are moderately polar but not as impactful as more polar groups (e.g., nitro or cyano). Examples like `CCCO` (0.65184554) or `CCC(C)O` (0.17267971) suggest a slight positive contribution, but this is offset by the aromatic/Cl effects.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The closest examples are likely:
  - `Clc1cccc2ccccc12` (-1.76373558): Aromatic + Cl, but no additional polar groups.
  - `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (-2.52749224): Aromatic + carbonyl, but no Cl.
  - `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (-4.89111827): Highly polar/cyclic, but this is an outlier.
  - `CSSC` (-1.98053059): Sulfur-containing, but simpler.

Given the combination of:
- Aromatic + Cl (reducing effect)
- Carbonyl in heterocycle (reducing effect)
- Phosphorothioate (moderate polar, but sulfur may reduce the value)
- Ethoxy (slight positive, but outweighed by other features),

the property value is likely **negative and moderately large**, similar to the aromatic + Cl examples but further reduced by the additional polar/heterocyclic features.

### Predicted Value:
A reasonable estimate is **between -1.5 and -2.5**. Given the structural complexity, I'll predict:  
**-2.1** (specific value: -2.10000000).  

This aligns with the trend that aromatic + Cl + polar heterocycles (especially with =O) yield significantly negative values, while the phosphorothioate group doesn't strongly counteract this. 

---
**Final Answer:**  
Predicted property value: **-2.10000000**  
---
(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples' trends for aromaticity, electronegative substituents, and polar functional groups.)

SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.32530335428222756
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I will attempt to predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO** (tert-butanol) by comparing it to structurally similar molecules in the dataset and identifying trends.

### Observations from the Dataset:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**: 
   - **CCCCCCC(C)O** (a branched alcohol) has a value of **-1.98603165**.
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol) has a value of **0.48304156**.
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** (tert-butanol) is more branched than isobutanol but less linear than the first example. Branching tends to reduce the magnitude of the property (make it less negative or more positive).

2. **Branching Effects**:
   - **CCC** (propane) has a value of **0.69923148**, while **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol) has **0.48304156**. Adding an OH group reduces the value but branching keeps it positive.
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** is even more branched, which may further reduce the value but likely keep it positive.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol) is structurally similar but less branched than **CC(C)(C)CO**. Its value is **0.48304156**.
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** is expected to have a slightly lower value due to increased branching but still positive.

### Prediction:
Given the trends, **CC(C)(C)CO** is likely to have a positive property value but lower than **CC(C)CO** due to increased branching. A reasonable estimate would be slightly less than **0.48304156**.

**Predicted property value for CC(C)(C)CO: 0.35** (approximate, based on interpolation from similar molecules). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the data.)

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -0.06466722803303458
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` by analyzing structural features and trends in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` is a bicyclic heteroaromatic system with the following features:
1. It contains two fused rings with nitrogen atoms (imidazole and pyrimidine-like structures).
2. There is a carbonyl group (`C=O`) attached to one of the nitrogens.
3. The molecule has multiple hydrogen-bonding sites (`[nH]` groups).
4. It is highly polar due to the presence of multiple nitrogens and the carbonyl group.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules in the Dataset:
1. **Nitrogen-rich heterocycles**: 
   - `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` has a property value of `0.30392071`. This molecule also has a carbonyl group and multiple nitrogens, similar to the target molecule.
   - `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` has a property value of `-0.71818185`. This is less similar due to the lack of a carbonyl group and the presence of methoxy.
   - `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` has a property value of `0.36470286`. This is structurally similar (carbonyl + nitrogens + hydrogen bonding).

2. **Polarity and hydrogen bonding**: 
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., carbonyls, nitrogens) tend to have property values in the range of `-1.0` to `1.0`, with more polar/hydrogen-bonding groups pushing the value toward the positive side.

3. **Aromaticity**: 
   - The target molecule is fully aromatic, which may stabilize it and influence the property value.

### Prediction:
The target molecule is most similar to `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` (property `0.30392071`) and `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` (property `0.36470286`). However, it has even more nitrogens and hydrogen-bonding capacity, which may increase the property value slightly. 

Given this, I predict the property value for `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` to be in the range of **`0.4` to `0.6`**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: `0.45`** (specific value chosen based on the trend of increasing property with more nitrogens/hydrogen-bonding groups). 

Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited dataset and structural similarities. For a more accurate prediction, statistical modeling or quantum chemical calculations would be needed.

Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.49185007490663585
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -O-, -C=O, -N-, halogens) tend to have lower (more negative) property values. 
     - Example: `CCCCCC(C)O` (hexanol) has a value of **-0.8239** due to the -OH group.
     - `CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (a steroid with ketones) has a high value (**1.5761**), but this is likely due to its large, rigid, and hydrophobic structure.
   - Nonpolar or less polar molecules (e.g., hydrocarbons) tend to have values closer to zero or slightly positive.
     - Example: `CCC(C)(C)C` (branched hydrocarbon) has a value of **0.0745**.

2. **Ester Group (-COO-)**: 
   - Esters (R-COO-R') are polar but less polar than alcohols or acids. In the examples:
     - `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC` (triethyl phosphate, similar to an ester) has a value of **-0.6762**.
     - `COc1ccccc1OCC(O)COC(N)=O` (a complex ester-like molecule) has **-0.9505**.
   - Esters with small alkyl groups (like methyl acetate) are more polar than larger esters, so their values might be more negative.

3. **Methyl Acetate (CC(C)OC=O)**:
   - This is a small ester with a methyl group and an acetyl group. It is polar but not as polar as alcohols or acids.
   - Comparing to similar-sized polar molecules:
     - `CC(C)O` (isopropanol) has **0.6998**, but this is an alcohol (more polar than an ester).
     - `CCCOC(C)C` (ethyl isopropyl ether) has **-0.1831**, which is less polar than an ester.
   - Given that esters are more polar than ethers but less polar than alcohols, I expect the value for methyl acetate to be between **-0.2 and -0.6**.

4. **Specific Prediction**:
   - The closest analog in the examples is `CCOC=C` (ethyl vinyl ether), which has **0.5992**, but this is less polar than an ester.
   - Since methyl acetate is more polar, I adjust downward. A reasonable estimate is **-0.4**.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is **-0.45**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples provided. For higher accuracy, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or more data would be needed.)

SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: -0.8974398577359847
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Group**: The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl rings attached to the nitrogen atoms (N-aryl urea). The structure is symmetrical, with two aniline (N-phenyl) groups bonded to a central carbonyl (C=O) group.
   - **O=C(NPh)NPh**, where Ph = phenyl (C6H5).

2. **Key Features**:
   - Presence of two aromatic rings (phenyl groups) contributes to hydrophobicity and may lower the property value (as seen in other aromatic systems).
   - The urea linkage (N-C=O-N) is polar but not as strongly hydrophilic as free hydroxyl or carboxyl groups.
   - No strongly electron-withdrawing or electron-donating substituents on the phenyl rings (just plain phenyl groups).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **N-aryl amides/ureas**: 
  - Example: **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** (property = -2.73618497) has a carbamate (urethane) group with aromatic rings and alkyl substituents. The urea in our molecule is somewhat similar but lacks alkyl substituents.
- **Aromatic systems with polar groups**:
  - **c1ccncc1** (pyridine, property = 0.49793682) is aromatic but has a polar nitrogen. Our molecule has polar urea but two phenyl rings, which are less polar.
  - **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (naphthalene derivative, property = -1.56389215) is purely aromatic with no polar groups, giving a negative value.
- **Symmetrical diphenyl systems**:
  - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene, property = -2.87070365) is highly hydrophobic due to chlorine substituents. Our molecule is less extreme but still hydrophobic.

### Expected Property Value:
Given the symmetrical diphenyl urea structure:
1. The urea group adds some polarity, but the two phenyl rings dominate, pushing the property toward negative values.
2. No strongly hydrophilic groups (like -OH or -COOH) are present to offset the hydrophobicity.
3. The closest analogs (e.g., naphthalene or hexachlorobenzene) suggest a moderately negative value.

### Prediction:
A reasonable estimate for **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** would be in the range of **-1.5 to -2.5**, leaning toward the middle of this range due to the balance between the polar urea and hydrophobic phenyl groups. 

**Final predicted property value: -2.0** (approximate, based on structural analogy). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is a qualitative estimate based on the trend in the given data.)

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -1.8441768237932132
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is **fluorene**, which consists of:
- Two benzene rings fused to a central five-membered ring (cyclopentadiene). 
- It is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with a rigid, planar structure due to the fused rings.

### Comparison to Given Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - **c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1** (property: 0.24116833): This is a larger, more complex polycyclic aromatic system (likely a benzanthracene or similar). The property value is moderately positive.
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene, not explicitly listed but implied in many examples): Smaller aromatic systems tend to have lower or negative property values unless functionalized with polar groups.

2. **Fused Ring Systems**:
   - **C1C=CCC=C1** (property: 0.24757816): This is a simple cyclohexadiene, not aromatic, but the property is slightly positive.
   - Fluorene is more aromatic and rigid than this, but less extended than the larger PAH above.

3. **Substituted Aromatics**:
   - Substitutions with polar or bulky groups (e.g., halogens, esters, amines) tend to increase or decrease the property value significantly. Fluorene has no such substitutions.

### Prediction:
Fluorene is a moderately sized, neutral aromatic system with no polar substituents. Its property value should be:
- Lower than the larger PAH (0.241) but higher than simple non-aromatic or small aromatic systems.
- Similar to or slightly lower than **C1C=CCC=C1** (0.247) due to increased aromaticity but lack of polar effects.

Given this, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.15** (moderately positive, reflecting its aromaticity but lack of polar functional groups). 

However, looking back at the examples, the closest structurally is **c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1** (0.241), and fluorene is a smaller version of such fused systems. Thus, a more precise estimate might be slightly lower, say **0.20**. 

But to align with the trend where smaller fused aromatics have values around 0.2-0.3, I'll refine to:  
**Final predicted value: 0.22**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural similarity and trends in the data.) 

However, reviewing the examples again, the larger PAH (0.241) is more extended than fluorene, so fluorene should likely be slightly lower. Thus:  
**Adjusted prediction: 0.18**. 

Given the uncertainty, I'd settle on:  
**Predicted property value for C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13: 0.19**. 

But to be precise, let's average the closest analogs:  
- Larger PAH: 0.241  
- Simple cyclohexadiene: 0.247  
Fluorene is between these in complexity, so **0.24** is also plausible. 

Given the spread, I'll choose:  
**Final answer: 0.23**. 

(For specificity, I'll round to **0.23** as the predicted value.)

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -0.751005800956054
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **NC(=N)N**: A guanidine-like group (highly polar, basic).
   - **S(=O)(=O)**: A sulfonyl group (polar, electron-withdrawing).
   - **Aromatic ring with NH2 (c1ccc(N)cc1)**: An electron-donating group (polar, basic).

2. **Polarity and Solubility**:
   - The molecule is highly polar due to the sulfonyl group, guanidine-like moiety, and aromatic amine.
   - Polar molecules in the dataset tend to have property values in the mid-range (e.g., **0.33806015** for **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12** (property: **-0.53840217**) is less polar but has some similarity in the polar amide/imide groups.
   - **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O** (property: **-1.70264245**) is more negative, but it has a nitro group which is strongly electron-withdrawing.
   - **CNN** (property: **0.94005966**) is a simple polar molecule, but lacks the complexity of the sulfonyl and aromatic groups.

4. **Electron-Withdrawing and Donating Effects**:
   - The sulfonyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing, while the aromatic amine is electron-donating. This push-pull effect may stabilize the molecule, leading to a moderately positive property value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of polar groups and the comparison to similar molecules, the property value is likely in the **moderately positive range**, similar to molecules with sulfonyl and amine groups. 

**Predicted Property Value: 0.45** (approximate, based on structural similarity to mid-range polar molecules in the dataset). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.3624700293157193
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, functional groups, and size. The molecule in question is:

**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**

### Key features of this molecule:
1. **Highly polar functional groups**: Two nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) and a trifluoromethyl group (`C(F)(F)F`), which are strongly electron-withdrawing.
2. **Extended conjugation**: The aromatic ring with nitro groups suggests significant electron delocalization.
3. **Tertiary amine group (`CCN(CC(C)=C)`**: Adds some basicity but is less impactful than the strongly electron-withdrawing groups.
4. **Moderate size**: Not as large as some steroids or long alkanes in the examples, but larger than simple aromatics.

### Observations from the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) tend to have property values around **0.0212474** (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`) to **0.56836266** (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O`).
- Trifluoromethyl groups (`C(F)(F)F`) are strongly electron-withdrawing but don't appear directly in the examples. However, halogenated aromatics (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1`) have negative values, while more complex halogenated systems (e.g., `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl`) have positive values (~0.65265613).
- The presence of multiple nitro groups and a trifluoromethyl group likely increases the property value due to additive polar effects.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of:
- Two nitro groups (contributing ~0.5–0.6 based on similar examples),
- A trifluoromethyl group (adding polarity, likely ~0.2–0.3),
- A tertiary amine (slightly offsetting, ~-0.1 to -0.2),
- Moderate size (not as large as steroids, which push values >1.5),

the predicted property value is likely in the range of **0.4 to 0.7**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.55**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples, as the exact property being predicted is unspecified. If the property is, for example, logP or another descriptor, the reasoning would adjust accordingly.)

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.49185007490663585
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis of **CC(C)OC=O**:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Ester (COO)**: The molecule has the structure **R-O-C=O**, which is an ester (specifically, a formate ester with a branched alkyl group).
   - **Branched Alkyl Group (isopropyl)**: The **CC(C)** fragment indicates a branched chain (isopropyl group attached to the oxygen of the ester).

2. **Comparison with Given Examples**:
   - **Esters**: 
     - **COC(=O)c1cccnc1** (property = -0.1319181): This is a methyl ester of a heteroaromatic acid. 
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (property = -1.41564931): This is an ethyl ester with an aromatic amine substituent.
     - **CCCCCOC(=O)C** (property = -0.75578423): This is a hexyl ester of acetic acid.
   - **Branched Alcohols/Ethers**:
     - **CC(C)(C)O** (property = 0.2570544): This is tert-butanol (highly branched alcohol).
     - **CC(C)O** (property = -0.82392012): This is isopropanol (less branched than tert-butanol).
   - **Aldehydes/Ketones**:
     - **CCCC=O** (property = 0.49726986): This is butyraldehyde (linear aldehyde).
     - **O=C1CCCCC1** (property = -0.20535533): This is cyclohexanone (cyclic ketone).

### Observations:
1. **Esters** in the examples tend to have negative property values (ranging from -0.13 to -1.42), with more polar or aromatic substituents lowering the value further.
2. **Branched Alkyl Groups** (like isopropyl or tert-butyl) tend to increase the property value compared to linear chains (e.g., **CC(C)O** vs. **CCCCCC(C)O**).
3. **CC(C)OC=O** is a simple branched ester (isopropyl formate), so its property value should be closer to the less negative ester examples.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- The simplest ester (**COC=O**, methyl formate) is not in the examples, but its property would likely be slightly negative.
- The isopropyl group (**CC(C)**) is less bulky than tert-butyl but more branched than linear chains, so it may slightly increase the property value compared to linear esters.
- The closest analog is **CCCCCOC(=O)C** (property = -0.75578423), but **CC(C)OC=O** is smaller and less hydrophobic, so its value should be less negative.

Thus, a reasonable estimate for **CC(C)OC=O** is:
**Predicted Property Value: -0.45** (between the methyl ester and linear alkyl ester examples). 

This balances the slight negative contribution of the ester with the modest positive effect of the branched alkyl group.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.24591436406590253
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **4-methyl-2-cresol** (a methyl-substituted phenol):
- Core structure: Phenol (aromatic ring with an -OH group).
- Substituents: Two methyl groups (one at position 1 and one at position 4 relative to the -OH group).

### Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol): Property = **0.34570381**
   - `Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3`: Property = **0.25198505** (more polar due to multiple -OH groups).
   - `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1`: Property = **-0.73892183** (ester and multiple -OH groups reduce the property).

2. **Methyl-Substituted Aromatics**:
   - `Cc1cccc(C)c1`: Property likely similar to toluene (not directly given, but alkyl groups tend to slightly increase or have neutral effects unless bulky).
   - `CCc1ccccc1C`: Property = **-0.73334879** (two alkyl groups on benzene, no -OH).
   - `Cc1ccccc1C`: Similar to above, likely slightly negative.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - The -OH group tends to give a positive contribution (phenol = 0.345).
   - Methyl groups are somewhat neutral or slightly negative (e.g., `CC(C)C` = 0.555, but this is an alkane; aromatic methyls are less impactful).
   - In `Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1`, the -OH is likely the dominant feature, but the two methyl groups may slightly reduce the property compared to pure phenol.

### Prediction:
Given that phenol has a property of **0.34570381**, and methyl groups are slightly reducing (but not drastically), the presence of two methyl groups might lower the value slightly. 

Looking at similar molecules:
- `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ccccc3` (triphenyl): **0.19599617** (extended conjugation, but no -OH).
- `Cc1cccc(N)c1`: **0.03876307** (methyl and -NH2, somewhat comparable to -OH).

Thus, for **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, the property is likely slightly positive but less than phenol due to the methyl groups. A reasonable estimate is between **0.1 and 0.3**.

### Final Prediction:
**0.215** (a balanced value considering the -OH and methyl group effects). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The property could represent logP, solubility, or another descriptor, but the trends seem consistent with hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity.)

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 1.1471371195811781
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P=S) Groups**: 
   - Molecules with **COP(=S)(OC)O** fragments tend to have positive property values, often >1.0 (e.g., 1.0539911, 1.92412818, 1.14158261, 0.91432163).
   - The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) in the aromatic ring further increases the value (e.g., 1.0539911 for Br/Cl, 1.14158261 for I/Cl).

2. **Aromatic Substitution**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, Br, NO₂) tend to increase the property value.
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., OCH₃, CH₃) tend to decrease or have a neutral effect.

3. **Thioether (S-C) Group**:
   - The **SC** substituent in the aromatic ring is moderately electron-donating but also introduces polarizability. In the given examples, sulfur-containing groups (e.g., thiophene, thioether) are rare, but analogous structures suggest a slight positive contribution.

4. **Methyl (C) Group**:
   - The **CH₃** substituent is weakly electron-donating and typically reduces the property value slightly (e.g., compare Cl vs. CH₃ in aromatic rings).

### Analysis of **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**:
- The molecule has a **phosphorothioate (P=S)** core, which strongly suggests a positive property value (>1.0).
- The aromatic ring has:
  - A **thioether (SC)** group: Likely a slight positive contribution (less than halogens but more than OCH₃/CH₃).
  - A **methyl (CH₃)** group: Slight negative contribution.
- No halogens are present, so the value will be lower than the examples with Cl/Br/I.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl**: 1.0539911  
  (Highly positive due to P=S + halogens)
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: 0.91432163  
  (Still high but lower due to no heavy halogens)
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**:  
  - No halogens, but SC is somewhat analogous to Cl in polarizability (though less electron-withdrawing).  
  - Methyl group reduces the value slightly.  
  - Likely between **0.8 and 1.0**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the balance of the **P=S** group (strongly positive), **SC** (moderately positive), and **CH₃** (slightly negative), the predicted property value is:  
**≈ 0.92**  

(Note: This is an estimate based on structural analogies and trends in the provided data. For precise predictions, computational modeling or experimental measurement would be required.)

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.39793561854911175
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = **0.63682616**
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = **0.83859053**
   - These molecules are heavily chlorinated biphenyl-like structures, and their property values are **positive and moderately high (0.6–0.8)**.

2. **Other Chlorinated Aromatics**:
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1**: Property = **-0.37706003** (less chlorinated, with an OH group)
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**: Property = **-2.56331657** (highly chlorinated but with an OH group, which drastically lowers the value)
   - **ClC(Cl)Cl**: Property = **0.43910176** (simple chlorinated aliphatic)
   - **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl**: Property = **0.04889528** (perchlorinated cyclohexane, lower than aromatic counterparts)

3. **Structural Similarity**:
   - The target molecule is a **hexachlorinated biphenyl-like structure** (two benzene rings with 6 Cl substituents). This is very similar to the two examples above with property values of **0.63682616** and **0.83859053**.

### Prediction:
The target molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is slightly less symmetrical and has one fewer Cl than **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (which has a value of **0.83859053**). However, it is more chlorinated than the first example (which has a value of **0.63682616**). 

Given this, the property value should fall **between these two**, likely closer to the higher end due to the high degree of chlorination but slightly lower due to asymmetry. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 0.75** (approximate, likely in the range of 0.7–0.8). 

For specificity, I would estimate **0.74**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based purely on structural trends in the given data.)

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.47829557861382865
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with polar or electronegative groups (e.g., nitro groups **N(=O)=O**, halogens, carbonyls) tend to have lower (more negative) property values unless balanced by hydrophobic or aromatic features.
   - Nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**) are strongly electron-withdrawing and polar, often leading to negative property values (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** has a value of **-0.89696702**).

2. **Chain Length and Hydrophobicity**:
   - Longer alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCCC**) tend to have more negative values (e.g., **-2.85360814**), likely due to increased hydrophobicity.
   - Shorter alkyl chains with polar groups may have less negative values (e.g., **CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O** has **0.61527989**, but this also includes aromatic and other substituents).

3. **Specific Examples with Nitro Groups**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O**: Three nitro groups, value = **-0.89696702**.
   - **CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**: Two nitro groups + aromatic + trifluoromethyl, value = **0.61527989** (higher due to aromaticity and other features).
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N**: No nitro group, but polar nitriles, value = **-0.08846726**.

4. **CCCN(=O)=O**:
   - This is a short alkyl chain (**CCC**) with a nitro group (**N(=O)=O**).
   - The nitro group is the dominant feature, and the short alkyl chain does not significantly offset its polarity.
   - Comparable to **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** but with only one nitro group and no aromaticity, so less negative.

### Prediction:
Given the strong polarity of the nitro group and the short alkyl chain, the property value should be moderately negative but not as extreme as molecules with multiple nitro groups or long hydrophobic chains. A reasonable estimate is between **-0.5 and -0.7**.

**Predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O: -0.62**

### Justification:
- The nitro group dominates, pulling the value negative.
- The propyl chain (**CCC**) is short and does not significantly counteract the polarity.
- Similar to **O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** but less negative due to fewer nitro groups and no aromaticity.

Thus, the predicted value is **-0.62**.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.28044722361783236
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogen Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br, F) often have negative property values, especially when multiple halogens are present or when they are on aromatic rings.
   - Example: 
     - Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 → -0.70901166 (Cl and Br on benzene)
     - BrC(Br)Br → -0.75246708 (multiple Br on aliphatic carbon)
     - Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl → 0.09597169 (multiple Cl on aromatic rings, less negative due to symmetry or size).

2. **Aromatic Rings with Single Halogen**:
   - COc1cccc(Cl)c1 → -0.28845559 (Cl on benzene with methoxy)
   - COc1ccccc1Cl → -0.29422212 (Cl on benzene with methoxy)
   - Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O → -0.20436043 (NO2 on benzene with methyl)
   - Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.70901166), but F is less electronegative than Cl, which may reduce the magnitude of the negative property.

3. **Effect of Fluorine vs. Chlorine/Bromine**:
   - Fluorine is smaller and less polarizable than Cl/Br, so its effect on the property may be slightly less pronounced. For example:
     - CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1 → -0.51369485 (F on benzene)
     - CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (not in dataset, but likely more negative than F analog).

4. **Combined Halogens**:
   - When two different halogens are present (e.g., F and Br), the property tends to be more negative than with a single halogen but less negative than with multiple heavy halogens (e.g., Cl/Br).

### Prediction for Fc1cccc(Br)c1:
- This is a benzene ring with F and Br substituents (para to each other). 
- It is most similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.70901166), but F is less electron-withdrawing than Cl, so the property should be less negative.
- The presence of Br (heavy atom) still contributes significantly to the negative value.
- Expected range: between -0.5 and -0.7.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.62** (slightly less negative than Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 due to F being less electronegative than Cl).

To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a bicyclic system with a **steroid-like or terpene-like framework** (two fused cyclohexane rings with methyl and hydroxyl substituents). 
   - Similar to examples like **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO** (property = 1.77734616) and **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** (property = 1.57858769), which are complex polycyclic structures with hydroxyl groups and high property values (~1.5–1.8).
   - However, this molecule is simpler (no carbonyls or additional rings), so the value should be lower.

2. **Functional Groups**: 
   - **Hydroxyl group (-OH)**: Present in many examples, often associated with positive property values (e.g., **CC(C)(C)CO** = 0.32530335, **OCCOc1ccccc1** = -0.51977324). The position (tertiary alcohol here) may increase the value slightly.
   - **Methyl groups (CH3)**: Neutral contributors unless in large numbers (e.g., **CCCC(C)(C)O** = -0.09640465).

3. **Size and Complexity**: 
   - Smaller than the steroid-like examples but larger than simple alkanols. Comparable to **CC1CCCO1** (property = 0.11008826), but with more rigidity and a hydroxyl group.

4. **Polarity**: The hydroxyl group adds polarity, which may increase the property value relative to non-polar analogs (e.g., **CCCC(C)C** would likely be negative).

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **CC1CCCO1** (property = 0.11008826): Simpler monocyclic alcohol.
- **CC(C)(C)CO** (property = 0.32530335): Tertiary alcohol with bulky groups.
- **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO** (property = 1.77734616): Complex polycyclic with multiple polar groups.

Given the intermediate complexity and single hydroxyl group, the property value should lie between the simpler alcohols (~0.1–0.3) and the complex polycyclics (~1.5+). 

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate is **~0.6–0.8**, balancing the hydroxyl contribution and the bicyclic framework. 

**Final Prediction: 0.72** (specific value chosen based on structural similarity to mid-range examples).

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 1.1850657492899057
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: This is a notable functional group, similar to the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O**, which has a property value of **1.86871553**. The presence of **P(=S)** seems to correlate with higher property values (likely due to its polarizable and electron-rich nature).

2. **Lactam Ring (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: This is a cyclic amide (lactam) fused to a benzene ring, similar to structures like **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCCC1)C(=O)N2** (property = -1.27887771) or **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)CC=C(C)C** (property = -0.21134032). However, the lactam here is aromatic (fused to benzene), which may stabilize the structure and influence the property differently.

3. **Ethoxy Groups (CCOP and OCC)**: These are present in both the target molecule and the reference molecule with **P(=S)**.

### Comparison to Reference:
The closest structural match is:
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (property = **1.86871553**).

The target molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is very similar but lacks the **SC(CCl)** substituent. The absence of this group (which introduces additional steric and electronic effects) may slightly reduce the property value compared to the reference.

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong similarity to the reference molecule but with a slightly less complex substituent, the property value is expected to be **slightly lower** than **1.86871553**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted Property Value: 1.75** (rounded to two decimal places for practicality). 

This prediction is based on the assumption that the **P(=S)** and aromatic lactam dominate the property, while the absence of the **SC(CCl)** group modestly reduces the value.

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -2.260470737691918
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, fused rings) often have property values in the mid-range (e.g., 0.2 to 0.8). 
   - Example: `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` (0.24906866) has two aromatic rings and a carbonyl group, yielding a moderate positive value.

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - The presence of a carbonyl group tends to increase the property value, especially if conjugated with aromatic systems.
   - Example: `O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (-2.18790681) is an exception where two aromatic rings conjugated with a carbonyl give a negative value, but this may be due to sterics or other effects.

3. **Heterocycles with Nitrogen**:
   - Nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrrole) often have negative or low-positive values unless balanced by other features.
   - Example: `c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2` (-0.27635057) is a nitrogen-containing fused ring with a slightly negative value.

4. **Substituents**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens, nitro) can lower the property value.
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., alkyl, methoxy) can increase the property value.

### Target Molecule: **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**
- **Structure**: This is a fused heterocyclic system with:
  - A central 5-membered ring containing two nitrogens (n1 and n3) and a carbonyl (C=O).
  - A benzene ring (c2ccccc2) fused to the heterocycle.
  - Two methyl groups (Cc1 and n1C).
- **Features**:
  - Aromaticity: Two aromatic rings (benzene and the fused heterocycle).
  - Carbonyl group: Conjugated with the heterocycle.
  - Nitrogen atoms: Electron-withdrawing but balanced by the aromatic system.
  - Methyl groups: Electron-donating, slightly increasing the property.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
1. `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` (0.24906866):
   - Similar structure: two aromatic rings, carbonyl, and nitrogen.
   - The target molecule has a similar framework but with a slightly less extended conjugation.
   - The property value is likely in the same range but slightly lower due to less conjugation.

2. `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (0.15745717):
   - Contains a carbonyl and nitrogens but no aromaticity.
   - The target molecule's aromaticity would increase the value compared to this.

3. `c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2` (-0.27635057):
   - Nitrogen-containing fused ring but no carbonyl or alkyl groups.
   - The target molecule's carbonyl and methyl groups would increase the value.

### Prediction:
Given the similarities to `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` (0.24906866) but with slightly less conjugation, the property value for **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** is likely slightly lower but still positive. 

**Predicted Property Value: 0.18** (approximate, based on structural analogy). 

### Refined Estimate:
- The carbonyl is conjugated with the aromatic system, contributing positively.
- The two nitrogens are electron-withdrawing but offset by the aromaticity and methyl groups.
- The lack of additional fused rings (compared to higher-value examples) suggests a value in the 0.1 to 0.3 range.

**Final Predicted Property Value: 0.20** (closer to the analogous example). 

However, given the variability in the examples, a more precise estimate would require regression or machine learning. Based on the closest analog (`Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O`), the value is likely **~0.22**. 

But to align with the observed range and features, I'll settle on:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.21** (reasonable compromise between the analogous structures). 

However, reviewing the examples again, the closest match is `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O` (0.24906866), and the target molecule is very similar but with a slightly less extended π-system. Thus, the value should be slightly lower.

**Final Answer: 0.23** (accounting for the carbonyl's contribution). 

After reconsidering, the most defensible prediction is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.24** (nearly identical to the closest example). 

But to avoid overfitting, I'll round to **0.23**. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest answer is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.22**. 

After careful consideration, the best estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.21**. 

Given the time spent, I'll conclude with:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.20**. 

But the closest example is 0.249, and the target is very similar, so:

**Final Predicted Property Value: 0.25**. 

After all, the closest analog is 0.249, and the target is nearly identical in key features. Thus:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.25**. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** is **0.25**.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -2.0409957692367064
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends based on molecular structure and functional groups.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons (e.g., CCC(=C)C, CCCCC)** tend to have moderately positive values (~0.17 to 0.47).
2. **Polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., -OH, -O-, -COO-)** often reduce the property value (e.g., OCC(O)C(O)CO: 0.248, CCOC(=O)N: 0.574).
3. **Halogens (Cl, Br, I)** can have variable effects but often lead to negative values when combined with aromatic systems (e.g., Clc1ccccc1I: -1.19).
4. **Esters (R-COO-R')** show a range of values depending on the rest of the structure. For example:
   - COC(=O)OC: Not explicitly given, but similar to CCOC(=O)N (0.574).
   - Larger esters with aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCC(=O)OCC) are not directly represented, but analogous structures suggest a moderate positive value.

### Analysis of **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is an **ester (ethyl hexanoate)** with a 6-carbon aliphatic chain and an ethoxy group.
- The molecule lacks strong polar/hydrogen-bonding groups beyond the ester, so the value is likely influenced by the aliphatic chain (moderately positive) and the ester (neutral to slightly positive).
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - CCOC(=O)N: 0.574 (ester-like with polar N).
  - CCCCC: 0.175 (pure aliphatic chain).
  - Esters with longer chains may have values between these.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the aliphatic chain (slightly positive) and the ester (neutral to positive), the predicted value is likely in the range of **0.3 to 0.6**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 0.45** (similar to esters/aliphatic combinations in the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data.)

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.2660619164396879
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Structural Features**:
   - The molecule contains a benzene ring (`c1ccccc1`) with an ester group (`COC(=O)`) attached. This is similar to:
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate), which has a property value of **-1.00727542**.
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate), which has a property value of **-1.26670695**.

2. **Comparison**:
   - Methyl benzoate (**COC(=O)c1ccccc1**) is structurally very similar to ethyl benzoate, differing only by one methylene group (`CH2`). The ester group is the same, and the aromatic ring is unsubstituted in both cases.
   - The presence of an additional hydroxyl group (`OH`) in ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate further decreases the property value (more negative), suggesting that the unsubstituted ester is less negative.

3. **Trend**:
   - The property value for ethyl benzoate is **-1.00727542**.
   - Methyl benzoate, being slightly smaller (less hydrophobic due to the shorter alkyl chain), would likely have a slightly less negative (higher) value than ethyl benzoate but still in the same range.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Given the similarity, the property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** should be close to but slightly higher (less negative) than **-1.00727542**.
   - A reasonable estimate would be around **-0.95**.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**-0.95** (approximate, based on structural analogy). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the provided data. If the property is logP or a similar descriptor, this aligns well with the observed values for esters of benzoic acid.)
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.6022846642607245
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property value for **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene):

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkenes (C=C bonds)**:
   - **CC/C=C/C** (2-pentene) has a property value of **0.40588929**.
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene) has a property value of **0.04054965**.
   - The presence of conjugated double bonds (as in styrene) tends to lower the property value compared to isolated double bonds (as in 2-pentene).

2. **Conjugated Systems**:
   - Molecules with extended conjugation (e.g., aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds) often have lower or more negative property values compared to simpler alkenes or alkanes.
   - For example, **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene) has a value of **-0.85487301**, while **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane) has a value of **0.11697428**.

3. **1,3-Butadiene (C=CCC=C)**:
   - This is a conjugated diene (two double bonds separated by a single bond), which introduces some electron delocalization.
   - Compared to **CC/C=C/C** (isolated double bond, value = 0.40588929), conjugation would likely reduce the property value but not as drastically as aromatic systems.
   - The value should be between that of **CC/C=C/C** (0.405) and **C=Cc1ccccc1** (0.040), but closer to the former since the conjugation is limited to two double bonds.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate for **C=CCC=C** is **~0.25**.

### Final Answer:
**0.25**
==================================================
Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: -0.7524670757257472
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

---

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - **Brominated/Aromatic**: `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1` has a very low value (-4.62521034), but this is a polycyclic aromatic with bromine, which may skew the property due to aromaticity and size.
   - **Chlorinated/Aliphatic**: `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a positive value (0.83859053), suggesting heavy chlorination increases the property.
   - **Chlorinated/Simple**: `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (dichlorobenzene) has a modest negative value (-0.18495195).

2. **Brominated Non-Aromatic Compounds**:
   - `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` (a bromo-chloro-fluoroalkane) has a near-neutral value (0.01344647), suggesting that bromine in small aliphatic compounds doesn't drastically lower the property.

3. **Steric and Electronic Effects**:
   - Multiple halogens on a single carbon (e.g., `C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` in `COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`) give a modest negative value (-0.32897418).
   - Tribromomethane (**BrC(Br)Br**) is analogous but with bromine instead of chlorine. Bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine, which may slightly increase the property compared to its chloro counterpart.

4. **Trend for CX3 (X = Halogen)**:
   - `C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` → -0.32897418  
   - `C(Br)(Br)Br` → Expected to be slightly higher (less negative) due to bromine's polarizability.

---

### Prediction for BrC(Br)Br:
Given the above, **tribromomethane** is likely to have a property value **less negative** than its trichloromethane analog but still modest. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted Property Value: -0.20 to 0.10**

From the examples, the closest analog is `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` (0.01344647), which is a mixed halogen compound. For pure tribromomethane, I predict:  
**Final Prediction: ~0.05**

---

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, dipole moment, etc.), this is based on relative trends in the data. If the property is **logP**, bromine's hydrophobicity would increase the value slightly compared to chlorine. If it's **polarizability**, bromine's larger size would dominate. Given the examples, the value is likely close to neutral. 

**Answer: 0.05** (approximate, based on analogous examples).

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 1.8687155327622984
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: Present in the molecule, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 1.72016123). This group often contributes positively to the property value.
2. **Aromatic rings (c1ccccc1)**: Present, similar to many examples (e.g., **c1ccc2ccccc2c1** with property = -0.75673213). Aromaticity alone doesn't dominate, but combined with other features, it can influence the property.
3. **Chlorine (Cl)**: Present in **C(CCl)**, similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property = -1.90159521), but here it's less dominant due to the larger structure.
4. **Lactam/Carbonyl (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: Similar to **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** fragments in other examples (e.g., **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O** with property = 0.62103873). This suggests a moderate positive contribution.
5. **Ethoxy groups (CCOP and OCC)**: These are polar and may slightly increase the property, similar to **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (property = -0.31547652), but here they are part of a larger, more complex structure.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 1.72016123), which also has a phosphorothioate group, a chlorine, and aromatic rings. However, our molecule has an additional lactam/carbonyl group and lacks the **N(C(C)C)** moiety, which might slightly reduce the property.
- Another similar molecule is **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (property = 0.83646792), which has multiple chlorines and aromatic rings but lacks the phosphorothioate group.

### Synthesis of Features:
The phosphorothioate group is a strong positive contributor, while the lactam/carbonyl and aromatic rings add moderate positive effects. The chlorine and ethoxy groups have smaller influences. Given the similarity to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** but with slightly less positive contributions from the substituents, the property should be slightly lower than 1.72016123 but still positive and significant.

### Predicted Property:
**1.45** (approximate, based on structural similarity and feature contributions). 

This is a reasonable estimate given the examples, where phosphorothioate-containing molecules tend to have higher positive values, and the additional features here don't drastically alter that trend.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.8014564537284226
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C** by analyzing structural features that correlate with the property values in the dataset.

### Key Observations from the Dataset:
1. **Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂, Cl, Br, F, S=O, C=O)** tend to decrease the property value (more negative).
   - Example: `CCCCCCBr` (-2.746), `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (-1.901), `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (-1.088).
2. **Electron-donating groups (e.g., OH, OMe, alkyl groups)** tend to increase the property value (more positive).
   - Example: `CCOC=C` (0.599), `CC=C(C)C` (0.489), `CN(C)C(=O)C` (0.511).
3. **Aromatic systems with extended conjugation** can have varying effects, but bulky or polar substituents often lower the value.
   - Example: `o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` (-4.181), `c1ccc2ccccc2c1` (-0.756).
4. **Complex heterocycles with multiple electronegative atoms (N, O, S)** often reduce the property value.
   - Example: `Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2` (-0.802), `Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23` (-1.201).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**  
Breaking it down:
1. **Polar/Electron-withdrawing groups**:
   - Chlorine (`Cl`) on the aromatic ring → lowers value.
   - Amide (`C(=O)N`) → lowers value.
   - Urea-like fragment (`N(C=O)N`) → lowers value.
   - Heterocycle (`n2nc(oc2=O)`) with N and O → lowers value.
2. **Electron-donating/bulky groups**:
   - Tert-butyl (`C(C)(C)C`) → slightly increases value.
   - N,N-dimethyl (`CN(C)`) → slightly increases value.
3. **Overall balance**:
   - The molecule has multiple strong electron-withdrawing features (Cl, amide, heterocycle) but also some bulky/electron-donating groups (tert-butyl, N,N-dimethyl).
   - The net effect is likely a moderately negative value, similar to molecules like `Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2` (-0.802) or `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` (-0.631).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarities to molecules with values around **-0.6 to -0.8**, and accounting for the competing effects of the tert-butyl and N,N-dimethyl groups, I predict:

**Predicted property value: -0.72**  

This is a reasonable estimate based on the dataset trends, though exact prediction would require a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model.

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: -0.041117203959017655
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - Two phenol groups (`Oc1...` and `Oc2...`).
   - Three chlorine atoms (`Cl`) attached to the aromatic rings.
   - The molecule is a biphenyl derivative with two aromatic rings linked by an oxygen bridge (`Oc1...Oc2...`).

2. **Similar Molecules in the Dataset**:
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = -0.38326473 (one phenol ring, two Cl atoms).
   - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2**: Property = -0.87680111 (two aromatic rings, two Cl atoms, no oxygen bridge).
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl**: Property = -2.56331657 (one phenol ring, four Cl atoms).

### Observations:
- The presence of **Cl atoms** tends to decrease the property value (more negative).
- **Phenol groups (O attached to aromatic rings)** have mixed effects but often contribute to less negative values compared to pure halogenated aromatics.
- The **oxygen bridge** in the target molecule (biphenyl-like structure) may slightly increase the property compared to non-bridged analogs (e.g., compare `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` with the target).

### Prediction:
The target molecule has:
- Two phenol groups (less negative contribution).
- Three Cl atoms (more negative contribution).
- An oxygen bridge (may offset some of the Cl effect).

Given that:
- `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (2 Cl) = -0.383
- `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (4 Cl) = -2.563,
the addition of one more Cl and an extra phenol ring (with oxygen bridge) would likely place the property between these two values, closer to the less negative side due to the oxygen bridge.

A reasonable estimate is **-1.2 to -1.5**. Averaging the effects, I predict:  
**Predicted property value: -1.35**. 

(Note: This is a heuristic estimate based on structural similarities and trends in the data. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or computational tools would be needed.)

The molecule in question is **CC/C=C\C**, which is **2-pentene** (specifically the trans isomer due to the \ and / notation for the double bond). 

From the examples:
- **CC/C=C/C** (likely 2-pentene or a similar alkene) has a property value of **0.40588929**.
- **CCCC(=O)OC** (an ester) has a value of **0.19871082**.
- **CCCOC=O** (an aldehyde) has a value of **0.43739832**.
- **CC(C)OC=O** (another aldehyde) has a value of **0.49185007**.

Alkenes like **CC/C=C\C** are less polar than aldehydes or esters but still have some polarity due to the pi-electrons in the double bond. The value for **CC/C=C/C** (0.40588929) is a close analog, and since **CC/C=C\C** is structurally very similar (just a stereoisomer), its property value should be very close. 

### Predicted property value for **CC/C=C\C**:  
**~0.40** (likely in the range of **0.38 to 0.42**, similar to the given **CC/C=C/C** example).  

For a precise prediction, I would estimate:  
**0.405** (matching the given alkene example, as stereochemistry likely has minimal impact on this property).  

Thus, the predicted value is:  
**0.405** (or very close to the provided **0.40588929** for the similar molecule).

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 0.12276708933594294
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes**: 
   - **CC#C** (propyne): 0.940 (high value, likely due to triple bond)
   - **C** (methane): 1.188 (very high, smallest hydrocarbon)
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): 0.727 (high, but less than propyne)
   - **CCCCCC=C** (1-heptene): -0.938 (lower due to size and double bond)

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): 0.700 (alcohol, moderate positive)
   - **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate): -0.077 (ester, near neutral)
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate): -1.007 (ester with phenyl, negative)
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (methoxy phenol): ~0.000 (ether + phenol, neutral)

3. **Ethers**:
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (methoxy phenol): ~0.000
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2** (complex ether): 0.712 (positive, but complex)
   - **CCCOCC** is a simple ether like diethyl ether, which is structurally similar to the above but simpler.

4. **Trend for Ethers**:
   - Simple ethers seem to have property values close to neutral or slightly positive. The presence of oxygen in an ether linkage does not strongly polarize the property toward extremes.

### Prediction for **CCCOCC**:
- It is a simple, symmetrical ether (diethyl ether) with no additional functional groups or complexities.
- Compared to **COc1ccccc1O** (which has an aromatic ring and phenol, yet ~0.000), **CCCOCC** is simpler and likely has a slightly positive value due to its aliphatic nature.
- It is less polarizable than **CC#C** or **C**, so the value should be lower than those but higher than large alkanes/alkenes.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **CCCOCC** is:  
**~0.3 to 0.5** (closer to neutral but slightly positive due to the ether oxygen).

However, looking at similar-sized molecules:
- **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol): 0.125 (alcohol, slightly positive)
- **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate): -0.077 (ester, near zero)

Since **CCCOCC** is an ether (less polar than alcohol but more than pure hydrocarbons), a value slightly higher than **CCC(O)CC** but less than **CC#C** seems plausible.  

### Final Prediction:
**0.4** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar molecules).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)  

---
**Predicted property value for CCCOCC: 0.4** (likely between 0.3 and 0.5).

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.4956945721999121
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary amide** group (`N(C=O)`), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (as an acceptor).
   - It has two **phenyl rings** (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`), which contribute hydrophobicity and aromatic stacking potential.
   - The **tert-butyl-like group** (`C(C)(C)`) attached to one phenyl ring adds steric bulk and hydrophobicity.

2. **Similar Molecules in the Dataset**:
   - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property = 0.79932696): This has a tertiary amide and two aromatic rings (one fused heterocycle and one phenyl). The property is moderately positive.
   - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = -0.89271075): This is a simple biphenyl-like structure with no polar groups, leading to a negative property value.
   - **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23** (property = 0.48239376): This has a tertiary amide and aliphatic rings, yielding a slightly positive value.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of the **amide group** tends to increase the property value (as seen in similar molecules).
   - The **two phenyl rings** add hydrophobicity but are balanced by the polar amide.
   - The **tert-butyl group** further increases hydrophobicity but may reduce solubility/polarity slightly.

### Prediction:
Given the balance between the polar amide and hydrophobic aromatic/tert-butyl groups, the property value is likely **moderately positive**, similar to the first example above but slightly lower due to the increased hydrophobicity of the tert-butyl group.

### Estimated Property Value:
**0.65** (approximate, based on structural analogy and trends in the dataset). 

This is a rough estimate, as the exact property being predicted (e.g., logP, solubility, bioactivity score) is unspecified, but the value aligns with the examples provided. For higher precision, statistical modeling or more examples would be needed.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -2.229388324577459
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a phenyl ring (**c1ccc(Br)cc1**) substituted with an acetamido group (**CC(=O)N-**). This is similar to molecules like **Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (property: 0.068) and **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property: -0.314), but with an acetamido instead of a hydroxy or aldehyde group.
2. **Substituents**:
   - The **Br** substituent is present in several examples, generally contributing to negative property values (e.g., **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**: -0.280, **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**: -0.314).
   - The **CC(=O)N-** group is electron-withdrawing and polar, similar to other amide/carbonyl-containing molecules (e.g., **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: 0.496, but this is more complex). Simpler amides like **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** have very negative values (-2.652), but this is a cyclic diamide.
3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1** has a property of -0.314. Replacing the **OH** with **NHC(=O)CH3** (less polar but still withdrawing) might slightly increase the property (less negative).
   - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1** (property: -0.246) and **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** (property: -0.280) are halide-substituted aromatics with modestly negative values.
   - The **CC(=O)N-** group is less polar than **NO2** or **COOH**, so it won't push the value as negative as some highly polar substituents.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the moderately electron-withdrawing **Br** and the **CC(=O)N-** group, the property value is likely slightly negative but not as extreme as molecules with multiple halides or highly polar groups. 

**Estimated property value: -0.25**  
*(This is a rough estimate based on structural similarity to molecules like Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.314) and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (-0.246), adjusted for the acetamido group's effect.)*

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -1.5800124925881176
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends based on molecular features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings (benzene)**: 
   - Molecules with a simple benzene ring (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1N**: 0.034, **C=Cc1ccccc1**: 0.041) tend to have property values close to zero or slightly positive. 
   - Substitution with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: -0.709) lowers the value, while bulky or polar substituents can increase or decrease it.

2. **Alkyl Substituents**:
   - Linear/branched alkyl chains attached to benzene (e.g., **CCc1ccc(C)cc1**: -0.725, **Cc1cccc2ccccc12**: -1.563) often reduce the property value, especially with increased bulkiness.
   - Branching near the benzene ring (e.g., **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1**: -1.417) further decreases the value.

3. **Isobutyl Group (CC(C)C)**:
   - The isobutyl group is a branched alkyl chain. From examples like **CC(C)CO** (0.483) and **CC(C)CCO** (0.197), branching alone doesn't always lower the value, but when attached to a benzene ring, the steric and electronic effects likely reduce it.

### Prediction for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**:
- The molecule has a benzene ring with an isobutyl substituent (branched alkyl). 
- Similar structures like **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (-0.725) and **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (-1.417) suggest that branching lowers the value further than linear chains.
- The isobutyl group is less bulky than a tert-butyl or multiple substitutions, so the reduction may not be as severe as -1.417 but more than -0.725.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.85**  

This balances the influence of the branched alkyl group and the aromatic ring, aligning with the observed range for similar structures.

Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.16086821158559877
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Simple Substituents**:
   - **COc1ccccc1** (anisole): Property = **0.10099994**
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (N-acetyl-p-aminophenol): Property = **-0.10421777**
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): Property = **-0.29247588**
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** (polycyclic aromatic): Property = **0.63817959**

   Aromatic rings with neutral or moderately polar substituents (e.g., -OCH3, -NO2) tend to have property values close to zero, while bulky or highly polar groups push the value more negative or positive.

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - **Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1** (thiazole with carbonyl): Property = **0.13150737**
   - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (unsaturated ketone): Property = **-2.03544397**
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol): Property = **-0.10421777**

   Carbonyl groups alone (e.g., aldehydes/ketones) do not drastically change the property unless combined with other features (e.g., conjugation, additional polar groups).

3. **Benzaldehyde-Like Structures**:
   - The closest example is **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol, property = **-0.10421777**). Benzaldehyde (**O=Cc1ccccc1**) has a simpler structure with only an aldehyde group attached to the benzene ring, which is less polar than an amide or phenol.

### Prediction for **O=Cc1ccccc1**:
- The aldehyde group is moderately polar but less so than an amide or nitro group.
- No additional functional groups are present to significantly shift the value.
- Compared to **COc1ccccc1** (property = **0.10099994**), the aldehyde is slightly more polar than a methoxy group, but not as polar as a nitro or amide group.

Thus, the property value for **O=Cc1ccccc1** is likely **slightly negative but close to zero**, similar to **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** but less negative due to the absence of the hydroxyl group.

### Final Predicted Property:
**-0.05** (approximate, likely between -0.1 and 0). 

Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is:
**-0.08** (closer to zero than the amide/phenol example but accounting for the aldehyde's polarity). 

However, reviewing the examples again, **COc1ccccc1** (methoxybenzene) is +0.10, and **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** is -0.10. Since an aldehyde is between these in polarity, a value closer to zero is plausible. 

**Refined Prediction: 0.0** (neutral, as the aldehyde's polarity balances out). 

But to align with the trend of slightly negative values for polar substituents, I'll settle on:
**-0.05**. 

However, looking at **Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1** (property = +0.13) with a carbonyl, and **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (property = -0.10), the aldehyde is likely less negative than the amide. 

**Final Answer: 0.05** (slightly positive, as the aldehyde is less polar than an amide but still contributes some polarity). 

After reconsidering, the most consistent estimate is:
**0.00** (neutral, as no strong trends push it clearly positive or negative). 

But to pick a specific value, I'll average the closest examples:
(**COc1ccccc1**: 0.10 + **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O**: -0.10) / 2 = **0.00**. 

Thus, the predicted property for **O=Cc1ccccc1** is:
**0.00**. 

However, since the examples don't include a pure benzaldehyde, and the closest is **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (-0.10), but benzaldehyde is less polar, I'll adjust slightly upward:
**0.05**. 

### Final Predicted Value:
**0.05**

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -2.5580835433305533
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Heterocyclic Core**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like core** (O=C2CN...C(=O)N2), which is a cyclic diamide. This is a polar and rigid structure, often associated with moderate to low property values in the given dataset (e.g., cyclic amides or heterocycles tend to have negative or near-zero values).
2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The presence of a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring (c1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O) is strongly electron-withdrawing. In the dataset, nitro groups often correlate with negative property values (e.g., Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 has a value of -0.13776002).
3. **Aromatic System**: The molecule has an aromatic ring (c1ccc(o1)), which is substituted with a nitro group and linked to the heterocycle via an imine (N=C). Aromaticity alone does not strongly predict the property, but combined with polar substituents, it tends to lower the value.
4. **Polar Functional Groups**: The molecule has multiple polar groups (C=O, N, N=O), which increase its polarity. Highly polar molecules in the dataset often have negative property values (e.g., Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 has -0.77476401).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2**: Nitroaromatic + ether linker, value = -0.13776002.
- **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**: Heterocycle with carbonyl and aromatic, value = -0.77476401.
- **c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2**: Aromatic heterocycle, value = -0.04836973.

The target molecule combines a **rigid heterocycle**, **nitro group**, and **polar linkages**, which suggest a property value more negative than simple nitroaromatics but less extreme than highly polar heterocycles. 

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above analysis, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.65** (range: -0.7 to -0.6).  

This aligns with the trend where nitro-substituted polar heterocycles in the dataset have values between -0.137 and -0.774, and the additional rigidity/polarity of the diketopiperazine-like core pushes it toward the more negative end. 

---
**Final Answer:**  
Predicted property value for **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**: **-0.65**.  

*(Note: This is an educated estimate based on structural analogies from the provided data. For precise predictions, computational modeling or experimental measurement would be required.)*

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -1.9932012939027386
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **0.30803572**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (a diazo compound with two phenyl rings) has a property value of **-2.48309048**, which is significantly lower. This suggests that adding a second phenyl ring with a diazo linkage reduces the property value drastically.
   - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a carbazole-like structure) has a property value of **0.36918409**, indicating that fused aromatic systems with nitrogen can have higher values.

2. **Diphenylamine-like Structures**:
   - The given molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is a diphenylamine derivative, where a nitrogen is connected to two phenyl rings (similar to the diazo compound but without the double-bonded nitrogen).
   - The diazo compound **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** has a very low value (-2.48309048), but the single-bonded nitrogen version (diphenylamine) is likely less electron-withdrawing and less destabilizing, so the property value should be higher.

3. **Comparison to Other Nitrogen-Containing Aromatics**:
   - Aniline (Nc1ccccc1): **0.30803572**
   - Carbazole (Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34): **0.36918409**
   - The diphenylamine structure is intermediate between these, but the exact value depends on the electronic effects of the nitrogen.

### Prediction:
The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is a diphenylamine. Given that:
- Aniline has a value of ~0.308,
- The diazo version (with a double-bonded nitrogen) has a much lower value (-2.483),
- The diphenylamine structure is less electron-withdrawing than the diazo version but more extended than aniline,

a reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than aniline but not as extreme as the diazo compound. A plausible prediction is around **0.2**.

However, looking at the diazo compound's extreme value, the diphenylamine might also be lower than aniline due to the additional phenyl ring's steric and electronic effects. A more conservative estimate might be closer to **0.1**.

Given the examples, I predict the property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** to be:

**0.15** (approximate, considering the trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data trends. The actual value could vary depending on the specific property's dependence on molecular features.)

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -4.035429314986975
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure (cyclohexane-like ring, **CCCC1**). 
   - It is a bicyclic system with two fused rings: one is a cyclohexane, and the other is a diketopiperazine-like ring (formed by the two amides).

2. **Similarity to Given Examples**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = -0.16862193): This is a similar diketopiperazine derivative with additional alkyl substitutions. The presence of more alkyl groups here may slightly decrease the property value compared to our target molecule.
   - **O=C1CCCN1** (property = 0.33024958): This is a simpler lactam (cyclic amide), and its property is positive but lower than our target due to fewer constraints and functional groups.
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = -2.65190329): This is a diketopiperazine with bulky substitutions, leading to a very negative value. Our target lacks such bulky groups, so its value should be higher.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The diketopiperazine core (two fused amides) tends to have moderate property values unless heavily substituted.
   - The cyclohexane ring adds rigidity but no strongly polar or electronegative groups (like NO2 or halogens), which would otherwise significantly alter the value.
   - The molecule is symmetric and lacks extreme features (e.g., long alkyl chains, halogens, or nitro groups), so the property should be in a moderate range.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, the property value is likely **between 0.3 and 0.6**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.45**  

This aligns with the moderate polarity and rigidity of the structure, similar to other cyclic amides/diketopiperazines in the examples.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.29539329181058627
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **-0.25111149**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a heavily chlorinated biphenyl derivative) has a property value of **0.79484712**.
   - The presence of multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings tends to increase the property value, especially if the molecule is larger or more substituted.

2. **Biphenyl-like Structures**:
   - **C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13** (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a property value of **0.11586254**.
   - Biphenyl-like structures with substitutions (especially halogens) tend to have higher property values than simple chlorinated benzenes.

3. **Specific Molecule Analysis**:
   - The target molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is a **dichlorobiphenyl** derivative (similar to a PCB structure) with three chlorine atoms in total (two on one ring and one on the other). 
   - Compared to **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (which has more chlorines and a bulky C(Cl)(Cl)Cl group), the target molecule is less substituted but still has significant chlorine substitution.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Dichlorobenzene has a value of **-0.25111149**.
- The heavily chlorinated biphenyl derivative has a value of **0.79484712**.
- The target molecule is intermediate in chlorine substitution (less than the heavily chlorinated example but more than dichlorobenzene), we can estimate its value to be **between 0.2 and 0.6**.

A reasonable prediction for **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is:  
**0.45** (approximately, based on interpolation from the examples). 

### Final Answer:
**0.45** (estimated property value).

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -1.954419294143413
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline): Property = **0.0343626**
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): Property = **-0.98666393**
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde): Property = **0.16086821**
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): Property = **0.6341406**

   Aromatic rings with simple alkyl groups (like methyl or ethyl) tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative. Longer alkyl chains (e.g., hexyl) seem to push the value more negative.

2. **Diethylbenzene (CCc1ccc(CC)cc1)**:
   - This is a benzene ring with two ethyl groups (symmetrically substituted). 
   - Compared to **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline, 0.034) and **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene, -0.987), diethylbenzene has two shorter alkyl chains (ethyl instead of hexyl or methyl).
   - The presence of two ethyl groups (moderate size) suggests the property value might be slightly negative but closer to zero than hexylbenzene.

3. **Polar vs. Non-Polar Groups**:
   - Polar groups (e.g., -NO2, -OH, -CO) tend to shift the property value more significantly (either positive or negative).
   - Diethylbenzene is non-polar, so the value should be less extreme than molecules with polar substituents.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Aromatic + small alkyl groups → values near zero.
- Two ethyl groups (moderate size) → slight negative shift but not as extreme as hexylbenzene.
- No polar substituents → no large deviations.

A reasonable estimate for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is:  
**-0.25** (between the slightly positive methylaniline and the more negative hexylbenzene).

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at similar molecules:
- **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): -0.986  
- **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline): 0.034  
- **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde): 0.160  

Diethylbenzene is less polar than benzaldehyde and methylaniline but has more alkyl character than methylaniline. Splitting the difference, a value around **-0.4 to -0.2** seems plausible. Averaging these, I predict:  
**-0.30**.

However, to match the precision of the given examples, I'll round to:  
**-0.35**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is:  
**-0.35**.

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -2.7373472209131453
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains an **aniline (Nc1ccccc1)** core, similar to some examples like **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (property = -0.02821266) and **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12** (property = -0.08700333).
2. **Substituent**: The aniline is substituted with a **sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O)**, which is polar and electron-withdrawing, similar to nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**) in some examples (e.g., **Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O**, property = -0.78077233).
3. **Electron-Withdrawing Nature**: The sulfonamide group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which may lower the property value compared to simpler anilines or less polar substituents.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: Property = -0.02821266 (nitro group is electron-withdrawing, similar to sulfonamide).
- **Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O**: Property = -0.78077233 (two nitro groups, more electron-withdrawing than one sulfonamide).
- **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12**: Property = -0.08700333 (heterocyclic, less polar than sulfonamide).

The sulfonamide group is less electron-withdrawing than two nitro groups but more polar than a single nitro group or heterocyclic nitrogen. Thus, the property value should be between **-0.78077233** (two nitro groups) and **-0.02821266** (one nitro group), likely closer to the latter.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is:  
**-0.15** (slightly lower than the single nitroaniline due to the sulfonamide's polarity but not as extreme as two nitro groups).

### Note:
This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the provided data. For precise predictions, computational tools or experimental measurements would be necessary.

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: -0.24876190321949743
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples. 

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings, forming a **tetracene-like structure** (though not linear; it's more complex due to the arrangement of rings). 

Key observations:
1. The molecule is fully conjugated and aromatic, similar to other PAHs in the dataset (e.g., **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12**, which has a property of **0.48192417**).
2. It lacks polar or electronegative substituents (like Cl, O, or N), so its property will largely depend on its aromaticity and size.
3. Larger, more conjugated systems tend to have higher property values (e.g., **ClC1(C(=O)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C14Cl)C5(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C45Cl** has **1.40866476**, but this is heavily halogenated).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12**: Property = **0.48192417** (similar fused ring system with a methyl group).
- **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54**: Property = **0.64085624** (5-ring PAH, slightly larger).
- **Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32**: Property = **-0.60701372** (smaller PAH with a methyl group).

### Prediction:
The given molecule is intermediate in size between the examples above. It lacks substituents, so its property should be closer to the purely aromatic systems. Given the trend:
- Smaller PAHs (like naphthalene analogs) have lower values.
- Larger PAHs (like 5-ring systems) have higher values.

For **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, which is a 4-ring PAH, I predict a property value slightly higher than **0.48192417** but lower than **0.64085624**. 

### Final Prediction:
**0.55** (estimated based on interpolation between similar structures). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, polarizability, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 0.2519850518108063
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, I will analyze the structural features of the molecule **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3** and compare them to the trends observed in the dataset to predict the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH), a carbonyl group (C=O), and aromatic rings. These polar groups suggest moderate to high polarity, which often correlates with higher property values in the dataset (e.g., **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** with 0.8038 has polar groups and aromaticity).
2. **Aromaticity**: The molecule has two fused aromatic rings (one with a carbonyl group) and an additional aromatic ring with hydroxyl groups. Aromatic systems with polar substituents tend to have higher property values (e.g., **Oc1cccc(O)c1** has 0.2666, and more complex aromatic systems like **OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O...** have much higher values like 1.9332).
3. **Symmetry and Conjugation**: The molecule is conjugated, which can increase the property value due to extended electron delocalization (similar to **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** with 0.8038).
4. **Hydrogen Bonding**: The multiple -OH groups can form strong hydrogen bonds, which often increase the property value (e.g., **O=C1CNC(=O)N1** with 0.4901 has H-bonding groups).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** (0.8038): Similar polar/aromatic features but fewer -OH groups. Our molecule has more -OH groups, likely increasing the value.
- **OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)...** (1.9332): Very high due to extensive conjugation and polar groups. Our molecule is less complex but has similar polar/aromatic traits.
- **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (0.2666): Simpler but with two -OH groups. Our molecule is more complex and likely higher.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above, the molecule's extensive conjugation, multiple -OH groups, and aromaticity suggest a property value **higher than 0.8038** but **lower than 1.9332**. A reasonable estimate is around **1.2 to 1.4**. 

Looking at the closest examples:
- **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(O)CCC12C)C3CCC4=O** (1.3577) is somewhat similar in complexity/polarity.
- **CC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O)C(=O)COC(C)=O** (1.7479) is more complex but shares carbonyl and hydroxyl features.

Thus, the predicted property value for **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3** is approximately **1.35**. 

### Final Answer:
**1.35** (rounded to two decimal places based on the dataset's precision).

Iteration: 56
SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 0.09785824426325426
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., P=O, P=S)** tend to have higher property values (e.g., 0.77133528 for `CCN(CC)C(=O)C(=CCOP(=O)(OC)OC)Cl` and 0.9487406 for `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`).
2. **Thioester (S=C)** or **thiol (S-C)** groups often contribute positively to the property (e.g., 0.13150737 for `Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1` and 1.92412818 for `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C`).
3. **Amide (NC=O)** groups can slightly increase the property (e.g., 0.11476005 for `NC(=O)c1cccnc1`).
4. **Small polar groups (e.g., O, Cl, N)** can influence the property, but their effect depends on the rest of the molecule.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** has:
- A **phosphate group (P=O)** linked to an **O-methyl (OCH3)** and a **thioester (SC)** group.
- An **amide (NC(C)=O)** attached to the phosphorus.
- A **thiol (S-C)** group, which is often associated with higher property values.

Given the presence of both **P=O** and **S-C** groups, which are associated with higher property values in the examples, we can expect this molecule to have a **moderately high property value**.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a property of **0.91432163** (P=S, O-aryl, Cl substituents).
- `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` has a property of **1.92412818** (P=S, S-alkyl, amide).
- `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a property of **0.9487406** (P=O, O-alkyl, Cl substituents).

Our molecule lacks the Cl substituents but has an amide and thioester, which are somewhat balanced by the O-methyl group. 

### Predicted Property:
Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** would be slightly lower than the phosphate-thioester examples but still in the higher range. 

**Predicted property value: 0.85** (approximate, based on structural similarity to molecules with values ~0.9-1.0 but with fewer strongly contributing groups). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data.)

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.5978259125910181
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size/complexity. Let's analyze the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene) in this context:

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Halogenated compounds (Cl, Br, F)** often have property values in the range of **-0.5 to +1.0**, depending on other structural features. For example:
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (hexachlorobenzene derivative) has a value of **0.6368**.
   - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (dichlorophenol) has a value of **-0.3833**.
   - `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (chloroaniline) has a value of **-0.0114**.
   - `CCBr` (bromoethane) has a value of **0.3674**.

2. **Alkenes (C=C)** tend to have slightly positive or neutral values unless combined with other functional groups. For example:
   - `CCC=O` (butanal) has a value of **0.7258** (due to the carbonyl group).
   - `CCCC(=C)C` (unsaturated hydrocarbon) has a value of **0.1746**.

3. **Symmetry and simplicity**: The molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** is small, symmetric, and lacks aromaticity or complex functional groups. This suggests its value would be modest, likely between **0.0 and 0.5**.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- The molecule is a simple dichlorinated alkene (no aromaticity, no additional polar groups).
- It is more polar than plain hydrocarbons but less polar than highly halogenated or multifunctional examples.
- Comparable molecules (e.g., `CCBr` at **0.3674**) suggest a modest positive value.

**Predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl: ~0.25**  
*(Likely in the range of 0.20 to 0.35 based on the trends observed.)*  

### Refined estimate:
Looking at similar small halogenated molecules:
- `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (chloroaniline): **-0.0114** (aromatic + Cl + NH2).
- `CCBr`: **0.3674** (simple bromoalkane).
- `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)...`: **0.6368** (highly chlorinated aromatic).

For **Cl\C=C/Cl**, the lack of aromaticity and simplicity would place it closer to `CCBr` but slightly lower due to symmetry and lack of alkyl groups.  

**Final predicted value: 0.28** (plausible range: 0.20–0.35).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends.)*

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 0.49793681758437297
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings with no substituents or simple substituents tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative. 
     - Example: **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline) has a value of **0.00100279**.
     - **c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1** (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a value of **0.24116833**.
   - Heteroaromatic rings (containing N, O, or S) often have slightly more negative values unless they have polar or electron-withdrawing substituents.
     - Example: **COc5cc4OCC3Oc2c1CC(Oc1ccc2C(=O)C3c4cc5OC)C(C)=C** has a value of **1.4588798** due to complex polar substituents.
     - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (a fused heteroaromatic system) has a value of **-0.71818185**.

2. **Nitrogen in Aromatic Rings**:
   - Pyridine-like nitrogen (as in **c1ccncc1**) introduces polarity but no strong electron-withdrawing or donating groups are present. 
   - Compare to **CNc1ccccc1** (0.00100279), where the nitrogen is outside the ring but still aromatic. Pyridine's nitrogen is more directly conjugated, likely leading to a slightly more negative value.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (a fused heteroaromatic system) has a value of **-2.14499717**, but this is more complex and has multiple nitrogens.
   - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12** (a diazine system) has a value of **-0.56825575**, which is moderately negative due to multiple nitrogens.

### Prediction for Pyridine (c1ccncc1):
- Pyridine is a simple 6-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen. It lacks strong substituents, so its value should be close to zero but slightly negative due to the electronegativity of nitrogen.
- Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is between **-0.2 and -0.6**. 
- A precise estimate based on the closest analogs is **-0.3**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **c1ccncc1** is **-0.30**.

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 1.1299076844848142
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

---

### **Structural Analysis of the Molecule**:
The molecule can be broken down into the following key features:
1. **Hydrophilic (polar) groups**:
   - Two hydroxyl groups (`OCC(O)CO-`): These are highly polar and typically decrease the property value (as seen in polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` with a value of **-0.8709**).
   - An ester linkage (`COC(=O)-`): Moderately polar, often associated with negative values (e.g., `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` has **-0.7343**).
   - An amide-like linkage (`Nc2ccnc3...`): The `N` attached to an aromatic ring is somewhat polar (similar to `Nc1ccccc1` in other examples).

2. **Aromatic systems**:
   - A benzene ring (`c1ccccc1`): Neutral to slightly negative influence (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1Cl` has **-0.1902**).
   - A fused heteroaromatic system (`c2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23`): The presence of nitrogen (`nc`) and chlorine (`Cl`) adds polarity and electron-withdrawing effects, typically lowering the property value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` has **-1.1775**).

3. **Chlorine substituent**:
   - A chloro group (`Cl`) on the aromatic ring: This is electronegative and often decreases the property (e.g., `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` has **-1.1775**).

4. **Overall size and complexity**:
   - The molecule is large and contains multiple polar groups, which generally correlate with more negative values in the given examples.

---

### **Comparison with Similar Examples**:
- **Polyols + Aromatic Systems**: Molecules like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (**-0.8709**) and `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (**-0.2550**) suggest hydroxyl groups contribute significantly to negative values.
- **Aromatic + Chloro + Nitrogen**: `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (**-1.1775**) and `c1ccc2cnccc2c1` (**-0.5609**) show that chloro and nitrogen reduce the property.
- **Esters + Aromatics**: `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` (**-0.7343**) is somewhat analogous to the ester part here.

Given the combination of **multiple hydroxyl groups, an ester, a chloro group, and aromatic nitrogens**, the molecule is expected to have a **more negative value** than most of the above examples.

---

### **Predicted Property Value**:
Considering the additive effects of these features, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-1.45** (with an expected range of **-1.3 to -1.6** based on similar molecules in the dataset).

### **Final Answer**:  
**-1.45**
==================================================
Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 0.10080568274970574
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): -0.85487301  
   - **CCCCCCCI** (1-iodohexane): -0.93871071  
   - **CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1** (tert-butylbenzene): -2.91825839  
   - **C1CCC2CCCCC2C1** (decalin): -0.99527356  
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol): -2.60124395  

   Hydrocarbons or halogenated hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values, with bulkier or more branched structures having more negative values.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **COC=O** (methyl formate): 0.9078687  
   - **CCOC=O** (ethyl formate): 0.67645906  
   - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)...** (complex ester): 1.65820819  
   - **CC(=O)OC3...** (complex ester): 1.50739031  

   Molecules with ester or aldehyde groups tend to have positive property values, especially if the oxygen is part of a polar functional group.

3. **Alcohols**:
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol): -2.60124395  
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tertiary alcohol): -0.43051803  

   Alcohols show negative property values, but the magnitude depends on branching and size. Linear alcohols (like 1-pentanol) are likely more negative than branched alcohols.

4. **Polarity and Size**:
   - Longer linear chains with a single polar group (like **CCCCCO**) tend to have moderately negative values due to the balance between hydrophobicity (negative contribution) and polarity (positive contribution).

### Prediction for **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol):
- It is a linear alcohol with 5 carbons, similar to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol, -2.601) but smaller and less cyclic.  
- Compared to **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (branched alcohol, -0.430), linearity increases the negative contribution.  
- The property value is likely between **-1.0 and -2.5**, closer to **-2.0** due to the linear structure and single OH group.  

### Final Prediction:
**-1.8** (estimated based on trends; exact value would require more data or a model).  

However, looking at **OC1CCCCCCC1** (-2.601) and **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (-0.430), **CCCCCO** is intermediate in size and linearity. A reasonable estimate is:  
**-1.5 to -2.0**.  

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**-1.75** (middle of the range).  

But since the examples suggest alcohols are often around **-0.4 to -2.6**, and linearity pushes it toward the more negative end, I'll refine to:  
**-1.9**.  

### Final Answer:  
**Predicted property value for CCCCCCO: -1.9** (approximate, based on structural trends).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data. The true value may vary.)

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 0.6890156663854666
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O))** attached to a **cyclic ether (CCO1)** and a **substituted benzene ring (Nc2ccccc2)**. 
2. **Functional Groups**: 
   - Aromatic ring (benzene) with an amide linkage (**C(=O)N**).
   - Sulfonyl group (**S(=O)(=O)**), which is polar and often contributes to higher property values (e.g., increased hydrophilicity or electronic effects).
   - Cyclic ether (**CCO1**), which can moderately influence the property.
3. **Substituents**: 
   - The benzene ring is substituted with an amide group, which is electron-withdrawing and may lower the property value slightly.
   - The sulfonyl group is strongly electron-withdrawing but also polar, which could increase the property value.

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with **sulfonyl groups** (e.g., **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, property = 0.9936) tend to have property values around **0.5 to 1.5**.
- Molecules with **amide linkages** (e.g., **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1**, property = -0.5137) often have negative or small positive values.
- Aromatic systems with polar substituents (e.g., **Oc1ccc(O)cc1**, property = 0.2666) tend to have small positive values.

### Hybrid Estimate:
Given the combination of:
1. The **sulfonyl group** (likely increasing the property value).
2. The **amide group** (likely decreasing it slightly).
3. The **aromatic system** (neutral to small positive effect).

The net effect is likely a **moderate positive value**, similar to other sulfonamide-like structures in the examples. 

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **~0.75**, balancing the contributions of the polar sulfonyl group and the amide-linked aromatic system. 

---
**Final Answer:** **0.75** (estimated property value).

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 0.8227176828370583
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, I'll analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular size, polarity, aromaticity, functional groups, and halogenation. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Given Molecule:
**COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)**

### Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic System**: Contains a benzene ring (`c2ccccc2`) with an electron-withdrawing nitro group (`N(=O)=O`), which is polar and increases the property value (similar to nitro-containing examples like `Cc1cccc(N=O)=O` with -0.204).
2. **Ester Groups**: Two ester groups (`C(=O)OC`), which are polar and likely increase the property (similar to `CCOC(=O)CC...` with 1.497).
3. **Amide-like Nitrogen**: A tertiary nitrogen in a conjugated system (`NC(=C)`), which may contribute polarity.
4. **Substituted Benzene**: The benzene ring is part of a larger conjugated system, similar to polyaromatic examples (e.g., `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` with 1.171).
5. **Molecular Size**: Moderate size (not as large as some high-value examples but larger than simple aromatics).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule resembles a hybrid of:
  - Nitroaromatics (e.g., `Cc1cccc(N=O)=O` with -0.204),
  - Polar esters (e.g., `CCOC(=O)CC...` with 1.497),
  - Conjugated systems (e.g., `O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)...` with 0.115).
- The nitro group and esters will increase the property, but the overall size is smaller than the highest-value examples.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of polar groups (nitro, esters) and moderate size, the predicted value is likely **between 0.5 and 1.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.75** (specific value: 0.75000000). 

This aligns with similar molecules in the dataset that combine polar functional groups and aromaticity without extreme size or halogenation.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.6417980499720143
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC(=O)**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). The amide groups are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding, while the cyclopropane ring introduces strain and rigidity.
2. **Symmetry**: The molecule is symmetric, with two identical amide groups attached to the cyclopropane ring. Symmetric molecules often have intermediate property values unless other strongly influencing features are present.
3. **Polarity**: The amides contribute significant polarity, but the cyclopropane ring is nonpolar. The balance suggests moderate polarity overall.
4. **Size**: The molecule is small (only 7 heavy atoms), which typically correlates with lower absolute property values unless highly polar or charged.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Amides**: 
  - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a property value of **-4.16563914**, but this is likely due to the strongly electron-withdrawing Cl substituents and the tertiary amide. 
  - **CCNC(=S)NCC** (a thiourea derivative) has **-0.53615244**, which is less negative despite the polar thiourea group.
- **Small Cyclic Structures**: 
  - **C1CCCCC1** (cyclohexane) has **-0.28779583**, reflecting its nonpolarity. 
  - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a complex steroid) has **1.57611844**, but this is due to its large size and multiple functional groups.
- **Balanced Polarity**: 
  - **CC(=O)C(C)(C)C** (methyl isobutyl ketone) has **0.14814684**, reflecting moderate polarity and small size. 
  - **OCc1ccccc1** (phenethyl alcohol) has **0.06028549**, showing how polarity and aromaticity balance out.

### Prediction:
Given the symmetric amides and small cyclopropane core, the molecule is likely to have a property value in the **moderately positive range**, similar to small polar molecules without extreme features. The rigidity of the cyclopropane may slightly elevate the value compared to linear analogs.

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.25**  

This aligns with examples like **CC(=O)C(C)(C)C (0.148)** and **OCc1ccccc1 (0.060)**, but accounting for the additional polarity and strain from the cyclic structure.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, dipole moment, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend of the given data.)

Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 0.658225216317875
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCC** (chloroethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Halogenated Alkanes**:
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): **0.17462922**
   - **CCC(C)(C)CC** (branched alkane): **-0.4103755**
   - **CCC1CCCCC1** (cyclohexane with propyl substituent): **-1.91395127**
   - **C1CC=CC1** (cyclopentene): **0.33681374**
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): **0.13227455**
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene): **-1.90159521**
   - **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl** (complex chlorinated hydrocarbon): **1.04377523**

2. **Chlorinated Small Alkanes**:
   - The only small chlorinated alkane in the examples is **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) with a value of **0.13227455**, but this is an aromatic system. For aliphatic chlorinated compounds, we can look at trends:
     - Adding halogens (Cl) to small alkanes tends to reduce the property value compared to their non-halogenated counterparts (e.g., **CCCCC** vs. **Clc1ccccc1**).
     - However, highly chlorinated aliphatic compounds (e.g., **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)...**) can have higher values due to increased complexity.

3. **Chloroethane (ClCC)**:
   - This is a very simple chlorinated alkane (ethyl chloride). Compared to **CCCCC** (pentane, 0.17462922), the presence of a single chlorine atom is likely to reduce the property value, but not as drastically as in highly chlorinated or aromatic systems.
   - The value is likely to be between **-0.5 and 0.2**, closer to the lower end due to the electronegativity of chlorine.

### Prediction:
Given the simplicity of **ClCC** and the trends observed, a reasonable estimate for its property value is:  
**-0.25**  

This is based on:
- The property value being lower than simple alkanes (e.g., pentane at 0.17) due to the presence of chlorine.
- Not as low as highly chlorinated or bulky systems (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** at -1.90).
- Similar to other small halogenated aliphatic compounds in the dataset.

### Final Answer:
**-0.25**
==================================================
Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: -4.131908265177556
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (n1)** substituted with a **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (trichloromethyl)** group and a **chlorine (Cl)** on the aromatic ring. 
   - Pyridine is a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring, which can influence polarity and electronic properties.
   - The **trichloromethyl group** is highly electronegative and bulky, contributing to steric and electronic effects.

2. **Chlorine Substituents**: 
   - The presence of multiple chlorines (one on the ring and three on the methyl group) suggests significant electron-withdrawing effects and potential hydrophobicity.

3. **Comparison to Given Examples**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (property = -0.295): This is a biphenyl with multiple chlorines, showing a slightly negative property. The trichloromethyl group in our target molecule is more electron-withdrawing, which may push the property toward more positive values.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (property = 0.795): This has a trichloromethyl group and chlorinated phenyl rings, similar to our target. Its property is positive, suggesting the trichloromethyl group increases the value.
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property = -1.071): This is a heavily chlorinated nitrobenzene, but the nitro group is more electron-withdrawing than a pyridine, leading to a more negative value.

### Key Observations:
- The **trichloromethyl group** tends to increase the property value (as seen in the second example above).
- The **pyridine ring** is less electron-withdrawing than a nitro group but more than a plain phenyl, so it may not drag the value as negative as the third example.
- The combination of pyridine + trichloromethyl is somewhat balanced but likely leans toward a slightly positive value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarities to **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (property = 0.795) but with a slightly less electron-rich core (pyridine vs. phenyl), I would predict a value slightly lower but still positive. 

**Predicted property for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl: ~0.45**  

(Note: This is an educated estimate based on structural analogies and trends in the given data. For precise predictions, computational modeling or experimental measurement would be required.)

Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.241509435275577
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (which is 2-hexanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (hexan-3-ol): Property value = **-0.88211929**
   - **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol): Property value = **-0.21070974**
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (1-phenylethanol): Property value = **-0.32181495**
   - **CCC(CC)CO** (3-methyl-1-pentanol): Property value = **-0.2454768**

   Alcohols generally have negative property values, with primary alcohols (e.g., CCC(C)CCO) being less negative than secondary alcohols (e.g., CCCC(O)CCC).

2. **Branching**:
   - Branching tends to increase the property value (make it less negative). For example:
     - **CCC(C)CCO** (-0.21070974) vs. **CCCC(O)CCC** (-0.88211929).
     - **CCCCC(C)O** is a secondary alcohol with branching, similar to **CCC(C)CCO** but with the -OH on carbon 2.

3. **Chain Length**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains tend to decrease the property value (more negative), but the effect is secondary to functional groups and branching.

### Prediction for **CCCCC(C)O** (2-hexanol):
- This is a **secondary alcohol** with a **branched 6-carbon chain**.
- It is structurally similar to **CCCC(O)CCC** (secondary alcohol, unbranched) but with branching like **CCC(C)CCO** (primary alcohol, branched).
- The branching in **CCCCC(C)O** will likely make its property value less negative than **CCCC(O)CCC** (-0.882) but more negative than **CCC(C)CCO** (-0.211).
- A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.5 and -0.7**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **CCCCC(C)O** is approximately:  
**-0.65**.

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples provided. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or additional data would be needed.)

Iteration: 67
SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -1.4685548219727995
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl): **-0.88618186**
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene): Not explicitly listed, but similar to the above.
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** (dichlorophenol): **-0.37706003**
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (dichlorophenol, different substitution): **-0.38326473**
   - **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** (highly chlorinated): **0.65000543**

   Halogenated aromatics with two halogens tend to have negative property values (around -0.3 to -0.9), unless heavily substituted (as in the last example, which is more complex).

2. **Brominated vs. Chlorinated Analogs**:
   - Bromine is heavier and more polarizable than chlorine, which may slightly increase the property value compared to chlorinated analogs (due to increased van der Waals interactions or polarizability).
   - For example, **ClCCl** (dichloromethane): **0.61578385**, while brominated analogs might trend higher (though no direct example is given).

3. **Symmetry and Substitution Pattern**:
   - 1,4-disubstituted benzenes (para-substitution) tend to have more negative values than ortho/meta, as seen in the dichlorobenzene-like examples.
   - **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is a symmetric para-disubstituted benzene, similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**, which would likely have a slightly more negative value than the asymmetric or ortho/meta examples.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (if it were listed) would likely be around **-0.6 to -0.9** based on the dichlorobiphenyl and dichlorophenol examples.
   - Bromine substitution might raise this slightly (less negative) due to increased polarizability, but symmetry keeps it negative.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- The closest analog is **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (**-0.88618186**), but **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is simpler (no biphenyl).
- Bromine is heavier than chlorine, so the value might be slightly less negative (e.g., **-0.7 to -0.8**).
- Symmetric para-substitution suggests a moderate negative value.

**Final predicted property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1: -0.75** (estimated based on the above reasoning). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an interpolation from the given examples. If the property is logP or similar, bromine's effect would align with this estimate.)

Iteration: 68
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 0.6341405978277626
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, halogenation (particularly chlorination and bromination), and aromaticity. The property values tend to increase with higher degrees of halogen substitution on aromatic rings and with increased molecular size/rigidity.

Let's analyze the given molecule:  
**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**  

This is a polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure with two benzene rings connected by a single bond, each heavily substituted with chlorine atoms (6 Cl atoms total). Comparing it to similar molecules in the examples:

1. **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (12 Cl atoms) has a property value of **1.29582297**.  
2. The given molecule has half the number of Cl atoms (6) but the same biphenyl core.  

From the examples, we observe:
- More Cl atoms generally increase the property value (e.g., compare **ClC(Br)Br** (-0.215) to the heavily chlorinated biphenyl above (1.295)).  
- Aromatic systems with fewer Cl atoms (e.g., **c1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, -0.209) have lower values.  

The given molecule is intermediate in halogenation between these cases. Extrapolating:
- The biphenyl core contributes positively (similar to the 12-Cl example but scaled down due to fewer Cl atoms).  
- The value is likely higher than small halogenated aliphatics (e.g., **ClC(Br)Br**) but lower than the heavily chlorinated biphenyl.  

A reasonable estimate is slightly below the 12-Cl biphenyl but still positive.  

**Predicted property value: ~0.85**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an empirical estimate based on the trend. If the property is, for example, logP or polarizability, the reasoning would adjust accordingly.)  

**Final answer: 0.85**

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 1.4999898581371445
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group contributions. The molecule to predict is:

**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: Three benzene rings (two substituted with methyl groups).
2. **Phosphate group (OP(=O)(O...)**: Highly polar and bulky.
3. **Ether linkages (Oc2... and Oc3...)**: Moderate polarity.
4. **Methyl substituents (C)**: Slightly hydrophobic.

### Observations from training data:
- Molecules with **phosphate groups** (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O`, property = 1.86871553) tend to have **higher property values** due to their polarity and bulk.
- **Aromatic systems with polar substituents** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1`, property = 1.17308551) also have elevated values.
- **Methyl groups** slightly reduce the property (e.g., `CC(C)c1ccccc1`, property = -0.68712973 vs. `c1ccccc1`, which would likely be higher).

### Prediction:
This molecule has:
- A **phosphate group** (strongly increasing the property).
- **Three aromatic rings** (moderate increase).
- **Ether linkages** (small increase).
- **Methyl groups** (small decrease).

Given the dominance of the phosphate group and multiple aromatic rings, the property should be **relatively high**, similar to other phosphate-containing examples but slightly tempered by the methyl groups.

### Predicted property value: **1.45** (estimated range: 1.4–1.5).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or a computed descriptor—this is an educated guess based on trends in the data.)*

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.4073827995930236
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: Present in the molecule. From the examples, molecules with CF3 (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C`) tend to have moderately positive property values (~0.6). CF3 is electron-withdrawing and often increases hydrophobicity or other related properties.
2. **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The molecule has a benzene ring with a CF3 group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. Aromatic systems with polar substituents (e.g., NO2, Cl, CF3) often have property values in the range of -0.2 to 0.6 (see examples like `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` or `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`).
3. **Chlorine atoms (Cl)**: The molecule has two Cl atoms, which are electronegative but often contribute to positive property values when combined with other features (e.g., `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` has a value of 0.65).
4. **Ketone (C=O) and nitrogen heterocycle**: The presence of a ketone and a nitrogen-containing ring (pyrrolidinone-like) can introduce polarity but may also balance hydrophobicity. Similar structures (e.g., `O=C1N(C2CCC(=O)NC2=O)C(=O)c3ccccc13`) have values around 0.02 to 0.6.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The molecule resembles a hybrid of:
  - `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C` (0.60661518): CF3 + polar groups.
  - `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` (0.65000543): Multiple Cl atoms + aromatic systems.
  - `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` (0.93570383): Nitrogen heterocycle + Cl.

### Predicted Property:
Given the combination of CF3, Cl, aromaticity, and a polar heterocycle with a ketone, the property value is likely in the **0.5 to 0.8 range**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 0.68** (moderately positive, balancing the electron-withdrawing effects and polar features). 

This aligns with the trend observed in similar molecules from the examples.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.315476517468166
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: This group appears in several molecules with varying property values. For example:
     - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of **-0.28671763** (two nitro groups).
     - `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` has a value of **0.37402605** (nitro not present, but other polar groups).
     - `Cc1cccc(C)c1N(=O)=O` (hypothetical) might have a value closer to neutral or slightly negative.
   - **Methoxy group (OCH3)**: This group often appears with slightly negative or neutral values (e.g., `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` has **-2.02339452**, but this also has two esters).
   - **Aromatic rings**: Neutral to slightly negative values unless polar substituents are present.

2. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol) has a value of **0.34570381**.
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (dinitrobenzene) has **-0.28671763**.
   - The presence of both methoxy and nitro groups on an aromatic ring suggests a balance between electron-donating (methoxy) and electron-withdrawing (nitro) effects.

3. **Polarity and Hybridization**:
   - Nitro groups are strongly electron-withdrawing, which could reduce the property value.
   - Methoxy groups are electron-donating, which could increase the property value slightly.
   - The net effect is likely a compromise between these opposing influences.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (methoxy-nitrobenzene) is expected to have a property value close to neutral but slightly negative due to the nitro group's stronger influence. 

Looking at similar structures:
- Phenol (`c1ccccc1O`): **0.34570381**
- Dinitrobenzene: **-0.28671763**
- A reasonable estimate for methoxy-nitrobenzene would be between these values, likely closer to zero but slightly negative.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O: ~0.10** (slightly positive due to methoxy outweighing nitro in this context, but this is uncertain; alternatively, it could be slightly negative like -0.1). 

However, reviewing the examples again, the nitro group seems to pull the value down more strongly, so a better estimate might be closer to **-0.15**. 

Given the variability, I'll refine to:  
**Predicted value: -0.12** (a compromise between the methoxy and nitro effects). 

But let's cross-check with `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (-0.286) and `c1ccccc1O` (+0.345). The methoxy-nitrobenzene is likely less negative than dinitrobenzene but less positive than phenol. Thus, a value around **0.0 to -0.2** is plausible. 

Final answer: **-0.10**. 

(Note: Without a clear quantitative trend, this is an approximate estimate based on the given examples.) 

**Predicted property value: -0.10**.

True Property: 1.139082065677451
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Structure**: The molecule is heavily substituted with chlorine atoms (8 Cl atoms), similar to **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (hexachlorocyclohexane, property = **0.04889528**). However, the given molecule is even more chlorinated and has a more complex polycyclic structure.
2. **Polycyclic Framework**: The molecule contains multiple fused rings (likely a cage-like or adamantane-derived structure), which may increase steric hindrance and reduce polarity compared to simpler chlorinated compounds.
3. **Comparison to Other Halogenated Compounds**:
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (property = **-4.62521034**) is a brominated aromatic, but the given molecule is aliphatic and more chlorinated.
   - **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (property = **0.04889528**) is a simpler chlorinated cyclohexane, while the given molecule is more rigid and crowded.
4. **Electron-Withdrawing Effects**: The high number of Cl atoms will strongly withdraw electron density, but the cage-like structure may counteract this by reducing solubility/polarity.

### Prediction:
Given the extreme chlorination and polycyclic nature, the property value is likely **lower (more negative)** than **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** but not as extreme as aromatic halogenated compounds like **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-1.25000000** (approximately midway between the hexachlorocyclohexane and highly negative aromatic examples).

### Justification:
- The rigid, cage-like structure with 8 Cl atoms would likely reduce the property value compared to simpler aliphatic chlorinated compounds but not as drastically as aromatic systems.
- The value reflects high steric hindrance and electron-withdrawing effects while accounting for the lack of conjugation. 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**-1.25000000** (estimated).

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.43739832387473065
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NH₂, -NO₂, -C=O) tend to have lower (more negative) property values unless balanced by non-polar or bulky groups.
   - Non-polar or hydrophobic groups (e.g., long aliphatic chains, halogens like Cl/Br) often increase the property value.

2. **Ester Group (-COO-)**: 
   - Esters (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 has a value of -1.4156) tend to have moderately negative values due to the polar C=O and O- groups.
   - The presence of additional polar groups (e.g., -N, -O) further lowers the value.

3. **Alkyl Chain Length**:
   - Longer alkyl chains (e.g., CCCCC#C = 0.216, CCCCCC#C = -0.6808) show variability, but shorter chains with polar groups dominate the trend.

4. **Specific Examples**:
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2** has a value of **0.7123**, but it is a complex ester with ether and aromatic groups.
   - Simpler esters like **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** have a value of **-1.4156**.
   - **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate, not in the list but similar) would likely have a moderately negative value.

### Analysis of **CCCOC=O**:
- It is a simple ester (propyl formate) with a 3-carbon alkyl chain and a formyl group (-C=O).
- No additional polar groups (like -N or -OH) are present, but the ester group itself is polar.
- Compared to **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (-1.4156), this molecule lacks the aromatic ring and amine group, so its value should be less negative.
- Compared to **CCC#C** (0.7266, non-polar), this molecule is more polar due to the ester, so its value should be lower.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above, the property value for **CCCOC=O** is likely in the range of **-0.5 to -0.8**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: -0.65**  

This balances the polarity of the ester group with the modest non-polar contribution of the propyl chain.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.07537322173059667
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobic/Aliphatic Chains**: 
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** with property **-0.98666393**) tend to have moderately negative values.
   - **CC** (ethane) has a surprisingly high value (**0.86392926**), but this is an outlier; most aliphatic chains are negative or near zero.

2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Esters (e.g., **COCC(=O)N(...)** with **0.34384269**) and other polar groups (e.g., **O=C2CN(...)** with **-2.55808354**) can significantly influence the property.
   - The presence of **C(=O)O** (carboxylic acid or ester) often leads to values around **0.3 to 0.6**.

3. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Pure aromatic systems (e.g., **c1ccc2ccccc2c1** with **-1.54753666**) tend to have negative values.
   - Substituted aromatics with polar groups can shift the value toward zero or positive.

4. **Hybrid Structures**:
   - Molecules with both aliphatic and polar groups (e.g., **CCCOC** with **0.4703252**) often have intermediate values.

### Analysis of **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is a **long aliphatic chain (10 carbons)** with an **ester group (C(=O)OCC)** at the end.
- The long hydrophobic chain would typically contribute a negative value (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** is **-0.98666393**).
- However, the ester group is polar and would push the value toward the positive side (e.g., **COCC(=O)N(...)** is **0.34384269**).

Given these competing effects:
- The long chain dominates somewhat, but the ester group mitigates the negativity.
- Similar molecules like **CCCOC** (ether, not ester) have **0.4703252**, and **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (pure aliphatic + aromatic) has **-0.98666393**.

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** would be slightly negative but closer to zero due to the ester. 

**Predicted value: ~ -0.3 to 0.1**  
Given the examples, a specific prediction could be:  
**-0.25**  

However, looking more closely at **CC(=O)C3CCC4...** (a ketone + aliphatic/cyclic structure) with **1.4927981**, it seems highly positive, but that's likely due to other features. For this simpler ester + long chain, a value around **-0.1 to 0.2** seems plausible.  

Averaging the trends, I'll predict:  
**0.05**  

But to be more precise, comparing to **CCCOC** (ether, 0.470) and **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (aliphatic + aromatic, -0.986), this is closer to the ether but with a longer chain.  

Final prediction:  
**0.15**  

However, reviewing again, **CCCC=C(CC)C=O** (unsaturated aldehyde) is **-0.88236833**, and **CCCCC(CC)C=O** is **-1.50580041**. The ester here is less negative than aldehydes, so likely higher.  

Given all this, the best estimate is:  
**0.10**  

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.10**

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.3380601507295708
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol-like moiety (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)**: 
   - Similar to **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = -0.28845559), but with additional substitutions.
   - Phenolic groups often lower the property value (e.g., **Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1** = -0.96334288).

2. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: 
   - Present in molecules like **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (property = 0.00644419) and **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)c1ccccc1** (property = -0.48612688).
   - Amides tend to have moderate or slightly negative contributions.

3. **Chlorine substitutions (Cl)**: 
   - Chlorines often increase the property (e.g., **Cl\C=C/Cl** = 0.59782591, **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** = -0.26595705).
   - Multiple chlorines (as here) may have additive effects.

4. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: 
   - Present in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = -0.26595705) and **NNc1ccccc1** (property = 0.15133946).
   - Nitro groups can be polarizing but may not drastically change the property.

5. **Aromatic systems**: 
   - Benzene rings are common in the examples, with properties ranging widely (e.g., **c1ccccc1** = 0.41993126, **O=C1c2ccccc2C(=O)c3ccccc13** = -0.83934708).
   - The presence of multiple aromatic rings with substitutions complicates the prediction.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** has one aromatic ring with Cl and NO₂ (property = -0.26595705).
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** has one aromatic ring with Cl and OH (property = -0.28845559).
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)c1ccccc1** has an amide and aromatic rings (property = -0.48612688).

The given molecule combines:
- A phenolic ring with Cl.
- An amide linker.
- A second aromatic ring with Cl and NO₂.

### Expected Trends:
1. The phenol and amide will likely pull the property toward negative values.
2. The Cl and NO₂ groups may offset this slightly (but not enough to make it positive).
3. The larger size and additional polar groups suggest a value more negative than simpler analogues like **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** but less extreme than highly negative examples like **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** (-2.73734722).

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, a reasonable estimate is between **-0.5 and 0**. A specific prediction could be:  
**-0.35** (reflecting the balance of negative contributions from the phenol/amide and slight positive contributions from Cl/NO₂).

### Final Answer:
**-0.35**

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 2.1239959437081617
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Groups (P(=S)(OC)OC)**: The molecule contains two phosphorothioate groups, which are polar and contribute to molecular weight and potential interactions. Similar groups are present in:
   - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 1.72016123), which has a high positive value.
   - Phosphorothioates often correlate with higher property values in the examples (e.g., 1.72016123).

2. **Aromatic Rings and Thioether Linkage (Sc1ccc...cc1)**: The molecule has two benzene rings linked by a thioether (S) bridge. Thioethers and aromaticity are present in:
   - **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 0.63950579), where multiple aromatic rings and halogens contribute to a moderately positive value.
   - Aromatic systems alone (e.g., **c1ccccc1**) have values around 0.41993126.

3. **Oxygen Linkages (Oc1ccc...)**: Ether linkages (O-aryl) are present, similar to:
   - **COc1ncnc2nccnc12** (property = -0.71259945), but this is less relevant due to the dominance of phosphorothioates here.

4. **Symmetry and Size**: The molecule is large and symmetric, with two identical phosphorothioate groups. Large, symmetric molecules with polar groups tend to have higher property values in the examples (e.g., **ClC1(C(=O)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C14Cl)C5(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C45Cl** has 1.40866476).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1.72016123), which also has a phosphorothioate group and aromatic systems. The additional phosphorothioate in the target molecule may further increase the property value.
- The presence of two phosphorothioates (instead of one) and the thioether bridge likely pushes the value higher than 1.72016123 but not excessively so (no extreme halogens or cage structures).

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, the predicted property value for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1** is:

**1.85** (approximate, likely in the range of 1.7 to 2.0 based on the examples). 

This is slightly higher than the similar phosphorothioate example (1.72016123) due to the added complexity and second phosphorothioate group.

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.021247399006714313
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - Molecules with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring tend to have negative property values. For example:
     - `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` → **-0.20973981**
     - `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` → **-0.13776002**
   - The nitro group seems to contribute to a decrease in the property value, especially when on an aromatic system.

2. **Hydroxy Group (OH) on Aromatic Ring**:
   - Molecules with a hydroxy group on an aromatic ring also tend to have negative or slightly negative property values. For example:
     - `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` → **-0.10421777**
     - `Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1` → **-0.24591436**
   - The presence of an OH group appears to further reduce the property value.

3. **Combination of OH and NO2 on Aromatic Ring**:
   - The molecule in question has both an OH and a NO2 group on the same aromatic ring. From the examples, this combination likely leads to a more negative property value than either group alone.
   - For instance, `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` has a NO2 group and an ether-linked aromatic ring (not directly OH) and has a value of **-0.13776002**. The direct OH + NO2 combination would likely be more negative.

4. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` (hydroxy and amide on aromatic) → **-0.10421777**
   - `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (methyl and nitro on aromatic) → **-0.20973981**
   - The molecule `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has both OH and NO2, so its value should be more negative than these, likely in the range of **-0.3 to -0.5**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is approximately **-0.35**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.35**

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 1.662084357505689
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group composition. The molecule in question is a highly branched polysaccharide (likely a derivative of a sugar oligomer like maltose or cellobiose, but more complex due to the multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and ether linkages). 

Key observations from the examples:
1. **Hydrophilic molecules with many -OH groups** (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`) tend to have **negative or low-positive property values** (e.g., -0.255 for the simple sugar derivative).
2. **Large, rigid, or halogenated aromatic systems** (e.g., `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`) tend to have **moderate positive values** (e.g., 0.397).
3. **Very large aliphatic chains** (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`) have **low-positive values** (e.g., 1.000).
4. **Molecules with mixed polar/nonpolar regions** (e.g., `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) have **higher positive values** (e.g., 0.948).

The target molecule (`OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O`) is a **highly polar, branched oligosaccharide** with:
- Multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups,
- Ether linkages (C-O-C),
- No aromaticity or hydrophobic regions.

Given its similarity to other polyhydroxylated systems (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` with a value of -0.255), but with significantly larger size and more hydroxyl groups, we expect a **slightly more negative value** due to increased polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity. 

### Predicted property value: **-0.42**  
*(Rationale: Larger than `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` but still dominated by -OH groups, placing it in the moderately negative range.)*

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.7265516482105873
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkynes**: The only alkyne in the examples is **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (dicyanobenzene), with a property value of **-0.08846726**. This suggests that triple bonds (C#C) may contribute to slightly negative or near-zero property values unless other functional groups dominate.
2. **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (heptan-4-ol) has a value of **-0.88211929**, likely due to the hydroxyl group.
   - **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (hexadecanol) has a value of **0.86364264**, indicating long chains with polar groups can have positive values.
   - Pure hydrocarbons like **CCC(C)C(=O)C** (3-methyl-2-butanone) have values close to zero (**-0.01794315**).
3. **Small Hydrocarbons**: 
   - **CCCC=O** (butyraldehyde) has **-0.15249741**.
   - **CC(C)OC=O** (isopropyl formate) has **0.49185007**, showing that esters can increase the value.
   - **CCCC(=O)C** (2-pentanone) has **0.26894322**, suggesting ketones may increase the value slightly.

### Analysis of **CCC#C**:
- **CCC#C** is a small alkyne (4 carbons, one triple bond) with no other functional groups. 
- Compared to **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (which has two triple bonds and aromatic rings), **CCC#C** is simpler and lacks aromaticity or additional polar groups.
- The property value is likely to be slightly negative or near zero, similar to other small hydrocarbons or alkynes in the dataset.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the simplicity of **CCC#C** and the trends observed, a reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.12** (slightly negative, reflecting the alkyne's influence but no strong polar or aromatic contributions).

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at similar small molecules:
- **CCCC=O**: -0.152 (aldehyde)
- **CCC(C)C(=O)C**: -0.017 (ketone)
- **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N**: -0.088 (alkyne + aromatic)

Since **CCC#C** is a neutral alkyne, its value should be between **-0.15** and **-0.08**. Splitting the difference:  
**Predicted value: -0.10**.

However, considering the lack of aromaticity or additional functional groups, a slightly more negative value than **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** is plausible. Thus:  
**Final predicted value: -0.12**.

### Conclusion:
The predicted property value for **CCC#C** is **-0.12**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. The property could be related to solubility, polarity, or another molecular descriptor.)

Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 1.3037091377059513
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: This functional group appears in some of the provided examples, such as:
   - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 1.72016123)
   - **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** (property = 1.49791371)
   These molecules have relatively high positive property values (~1.5 to 1.7), suggesting that the P(=S) group may contribute to increasing the property.

2. **Aromatic ring with multiple chlorine substitutions (c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl)**: 
   - Chlorinated aromatic rings appear in several examples, such as:
     - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 0.63682616)
     - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl** (property = -0.81491192)
   The property values for these range from negative to moderately positive, depending on the number of chlorines and other substituents.

3. **Ethoxy groups (CCO and OCC)**:
   - Ethoxy groups are present in some examples, but their effect seems secondary compared to the P(=S) and Cl substitutions.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
The closest analog in the provided examples is:
- **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 1.72016123), which has:
  - A P(=S) group.
  - A chlorinated aromatic ring.
  - Additional polar substituents (C(=O)N).

Our target molecule (**CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**) is slightly less polar (no amide group) but has a similar P(=S) and tri-chlorinated aromatic ring. The absence of the highly polar amide group might reduce the property slightly compared to 1.72016123.

Another similar molecule is:
- **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** (property = 1.49791371), which has two P(=S) groups and ester functionalities. Our target has only one P(=S) and no esters, so the property should be lower than this.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above analysis, the property for **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** is likely in the range of **0.8 to 1.2**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property: 1.05** (specific value could be refined with more data, but this is a plausible interpolation). 

However, looking back at the examples, the presence of P(=S) and Cl substitutions tends to push the value higher. A more precise estimate might be closer to **1.2**. 

Given the similarity to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1.720) but with fewer polar groups, I'll adjust downward slightly:

**Final predicted property: 1.35** (this balances the P(=S) contribution and the Cl substitutions). 

But to be more conservative, given the variability in the examples, a value around **1.1** is also reasonable. 

After reconsidering, I'll settle on:  
**Predicted property: 1.25** (as a midpoint between the higher P(=S) examples and the less polar variants). 

However, the most confident range is **1.0 to 1.4**. If forced to pick one value:  
**Predicted property: 1.15**. 

But given the data, the safest bet is likely closer to **1.2**. 

Final answer:  
**Predicted property: 1.20**.

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.07118328673569033
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (c1nccc)** with a **hydrazide group (C(=O)NN)** attached. 
   - The pyridine ring is aromatic and polar due to the nitrogen atom.
   - The hydrazide group is highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (donor and acceptor).

2. **Key Observations from Examples**:
   - Molecules with polar/heteroatom-rich groups (e.g., amides, nitro, halogens) tend to have negative property values (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` = -1.587, `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` = -1.088).
   - Simple aromatic systems with moderate polarity (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1Cl` = -0.251) have small negative values.
   - The hydrazide group is more polar than simple halogens or ethers, suggesting a stronger negative contribution.

3. **Analogous Examples**:
   - `Nc1ccccc1Cl` (-0.015): Aromatic + polar group (amine + halogen).
   - `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` (-0.250): Heterocycle with polar amide-like groups.
   - `COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1` (-0.478): Polar heterocycle with multiple H-bonding groups.

### Prediction:
The hydrazide group in **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1** is more polar than the examples above, but the pyridine ring alone would contribute a smaller negative value. Balancing these factors, the property value should be more negative than `Nc1ccccc1Cl` (-0.015) but less negative than highly polar multi-substituted systems (e.g., -1.587). 

A reasonable estimate is **-0.65**, considering:
- The pyridine ring (~ -0.2 to -0.3 contribution).
- The hydrazide group (~ -0.3 to -0.4 additional contribution).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: -0.65** (approximate, based on structural analogy).

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 1.924128183078296
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: This is a notable functional group, similar to the **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** example (property = **0.70934776**). The presence of P(=S) often contributes positively to the property value.
2. **Thioether Linkage (SCC(=O))**: The sulfur atom in the thioether linkage may have a slight positive influence, similar to the **CCS** example (property = **0.59172219**).
3. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: The amide is present in many examples, such as **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (property = **0.15745717**) and **CCOC(=O)N** (property = **0.57442076**). This group tends to contribute moderately.
4. **Cyclohexane Ring (N1CCCCC1)**: Aliphatic rings like cyclohexane are present in examples like **C/C1CCCCC1\C** (property = **-1.5184182**), but here it's substituted with an amide, which may reduce its negative impact.
5. **Alkyl Chains (CCCO and OCCC)**: These are neutral to slightly positive contributors, depending on length and branching.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** has a property of **0.70934776**, and it shares the P(=S) group with our target molecule.
- The molecule **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (property = **0.15745717**) shares the amide group.
- The molecule **CCS** (property = **0.59172219**) shares the sulfur linkage.

Given that our molecule combines **P(=S)**, **thioether**, and **amide** functionalities, we can expect a property value in the **positive range**, likely higher than **0.70934776** due to the additional thioether and amide contributions but not excessively high due to the aliphatic nature of much of the structure.

### Predicted Property:
Considering the above, a reasonable prediction for **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C** is:

**0.85** (approximate, based on structural similarity and additive contributions). 

This is slightly higher than the **0.70934776** example due to the additional sulfur and amide groups but not as high as some of the more complex or highly substituted examples (e.g., **1.5+**). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, dipole moment, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)

- **CC(C)CCO** (2-methylbutan-1-ol) has a value of **0.19741046**.
- **CCCC/C=C/C** (4-octene) has a value of **-0.3130807**.
- **CCCCCC1CCCC1** (octylcyclopentane) has a value of **-1.05614506**.

For linear alkanes:
- The presence of oxygen (e.g., alcohols) tends to increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.
- Longer hydrocarbon chains without functional groups tend to have lower (more negative) values.
- **CCCCCCCC** has no functional groups and is a longer hydrocarbon, so its value should be lower than most of the examples but not as low as highly polar or cyclic structures (e.g., **Nc1cccc2ccccc12** with **-1.08879108**).

Given that **CCCCCC1CCCC1** (octylcyclopentane) is **-1.05614506** and **CCCC/C=C/C** (4-octene) is **-0.3130807**, the purely linear **CCCCCCCC** (octane) would likely be between these, closer to the lower end due to lack of unsaturation or functional groups.

### Predicted property value for **CCCCCCCC**: **-0.85** (approximate, based on trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data trends. The actual value could vary slightly depending on the specific property's dependence on molecular features.)

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 1.3176110325199841
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular features such as the presence of carbonyl groups (C=O), hydroxyl groups (OH), aromatic rings, halogen substitutions, and overall molecular complexity (e.g., ring systems, branching, and functional group diversity). 

The molecule to predict is:  
**CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**

### Key structural features:
1. **Multiple rings (steroid-like framework)**: The molecule has a complex polycyclic structure, similar to some of the higher-property-value examples (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` with property **1.28275978**).
2. **Carbonyl group (C=O)**: The presence of `=O` tends to increase the property value (e.g., `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` has **1.48278867**).
3. **Hydroxyl groups (OH)**: Two hydroxyl groups (`O` attached to rings) further increase the property (similar to other hydroxylated steroids in the examples).
4. **Alkyne group (C#C)**: This is a less common feature, but its contribution is likely modest compared to the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups.
5. **No halogens or heteroatoms (N, S, P)**: The absence of these tends to avoid lowering the property (e.g., halogenated aromatics have lower values).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` → **1.28275978** (similar but lacks one OH and the alkyne).
- `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` → **1.48278867** (two carbonyls, one OH).
- `CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO` → **1.57858769** (more functionalized with F and additional carbonyl).

### Prediction:
The given molecule has **two hydroxyl groups, one carbonyl, and an alkyne**, placing it between the first two examples above. The alkyne may slightly increase the property compared to purely hydrocarbon features. 

**Predicted property value: ~1.35**  
(Plausible range: **1.30 to 1.45**, based on the trend in the examples.)  

For specificity, I would predict:  
**1.38** (closer to the middle of the range, accounting for the alkyne's minor contribution).

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 2.162292055250614
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to predict the property value.

### Molecule to Predict:
**SMILES:** `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67`

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings:** The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings (e.g., `c1cc...`), which are also present in many of the examples. Aromaticity often contributes positively to the property value (e.g., `c1ccccc1` has a value of 0.419).
2. **Oxygen Substituents:** There are many oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., methoxy `OCH3`, hydroxyl `OH`, and carbonyl `C=O`). These are polar and can influence the property value. For example:
   - `Oc1ccccc1Cl` has a value of 0.033.
   - `COc1ccccc1Cl` has a value of -0.294.
   - The presence of multiple oxygen substituents may lower the value compared to pure aromatic systems.
3. **Complexity:** The molecule is highly complex with fused rings and multiple substituents. Larger, more complex molecules in the examples tend to have higher values (e.g., `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` has a value of 2.043).
4. **Heterocycles and Ethers:** The presence of heterocycles (e.g., `OCOc5cc67`) and ethers (`COC`) can influence the property. For example, `c2ccc1ocnc1c2` has a value of -0.068, but this is a smaller system.
5. **Overall Polarity:** The molecule is highly polar due to the abundance of oxygen atoms, which may reduce the property value compared to less polar aromatic systems.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule is most similar to large, oxygenated aromatic systems with fused rings. Examples like `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1` (value: 2.124) and `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` (value: 2.043) suggest that large, complex, and polar molecules can have high values.
- However, the abundance of oxygen substituents may temper this effect, pulling the value down slightly compared to purely hydrocarbon systems.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the size, complexity, and polarity of the molecule, I predict a property value of **1.85**. This balances the positive contribution of aromaticity and complexity with the negative influence of high polarity.

**Final Answer:** `1.85`

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 0.0329777834225451
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol): **0.0212474**
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (another nitrophenol): **0.0167828**
     - These values are close to zero, suggesting that the nitro group (-NO₂) has a modest effect on the property.
   - **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is structurally similar but replaces -NO₂ with -Cl.

2. **Chlorinated Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene): **-1.18956549**
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl): **-0.87680111**
   - **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** (chloronaphthalene): **-1.76373558**
     - Chlorinated aromatics tend to have negative property values, often between -0.8 and -1.8.

3. **Phenol vs. Chlorophenol**:
   - Phenol itself is not in the examples, but nitrophenols (with -NO₂) are near zero.
   - Adding -Cl to the aromatic ring (as in chlorophenol) would likely decrease the property value compared to phenol/nitrophenol, based on the trend from chlorinated aromatics.

4. **Other Halogenated Phenols**:
   - **Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I** (diiodo-cyanophenol): **-1.13947547**
     - This suggests that heavier halogens (I) and polar groups (C#N) further decrease the property value.

### Prediction for **Oc1ccccc1Cl**:
- The molecule is a chlorophenol, with -Cl replacing -H on phenol.
- Compared to nitrophenols (~0.02), the -Cl group should reduce the property value.
- Compared to chloroiodobenzene (-1.189) or chloronaphthalene (-1.764), chlorophenol is less "chlorinated" and has an -OH group, which may moderate the decrease.
- A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.8 and -1.2**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, the property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is likely around **-0.95**. 

**Predicted value: -0.95** (approximate, based on analogous examples).

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -0.47440061610096756
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Structural Analysis of the Molecule:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Cl-substituted aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)**: Present in many examples, often associated with moderate positive or negative values (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl → 0.6368; Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1 → -1.7445). The presence of two Cl atoms suggests a slight negative contribution.
   - **Amide linkage (OC(=O)N)**: Seen in molecules like FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O (0.4074) and O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (1.3168). This group tends to increase the property value, especially when part of a rigid or conjugated system.
   - **Alkyne (C#C)**: Rare in the examples, but similar to double bonds or rigid linkers, which can slightly increase the value.
   - **Ether (O)**: Neutral to slightly negative influence (e.g., CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1 → -4.5799 is an outlier due to the strongly negative N-substituent; CCCCOCCO → -0.3886).
   - **Chloroalkyl (ClCC)**: Similar to CCCCl (0.4152) or ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl (0.0489), suggesting a small positive contribution.

2. **Polarity and Conjugation**:
   - The molecule has moderate polarity due to the amide and Cl substituents but lacks extensive conjugation (aside from the aromatic ring). This suggests a value in the low-to-moderate range.

3. **Comparison to Similar Examples**:
   - **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O (0.4074)**: Contains a polar amide and halogenated groups; our molecule is less polar but has similar features.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (0.6368)**: Highly halogenated but no amide; our molecule has fewer Cl atoms but adds an amide.
   - **O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (1.3168)**: Contains two amides and bulky aromatic groups; our molecule is simpler but shares the amide + aromatic motif.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance between:
- Positive contributions from the amide and Cl substituents (~0.3 to 0.6),
- Negative contributions from the alkyne and ether (~-0.2 to -0.5),
- Overall moderate polarity and lack of extreme features,

**Predicted value: 0.25** (with an estimated uncertainty of ±0.2). This places it in the range of similar molecules like CCCCl (0.4152) or CC(C)C(C)O (0.2327).

### Final Answer:
**0.25**
==================================================
Iteration: 88
SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 0.8038153937152528
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a central carbon (C) attached to:
   - A hydroxyl group (**OH**).
   - A chlorophenyl ring (**c1ccc(Cl)cc1**).
   - A pyrimidine-like ring (**c2cncnc2**, resembling a heterocyclic aromatic system with nitrogen atoms).
   - Another chlorophenyl ring (**c3ccccc3Cl**).

2. **Key Features**:
   - Presence of **two aromatic rings** (both with Cl substituents).
   - A **heterocyclic aromatic ring (c2cncnc2)** with nitrogen atoms, which can influence polarity and electronic properties.
   - A **hydroxyl group (OH)**, which adds polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.
   - **Chlorine substituents** on both phenyl rings, which add electron-withdrawing effects and lipophilicity.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Aromatic Systems with Heteroatoms**:
  - **Nc1nc[nH]n1** (property = 0.659) has a similar heterocyclic system (imidazole-like) and a positive property value.
  - **Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property = -0.276) has a fused heterocyclic system but is less similar.
- **Chlorinated Aromatics**:
  - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1** (property = -0.245) has two Cl atoms on a phenyl ring.
  - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (property = 0.794) has multiple Cl atoms and a bulky structure, leading to a higher positive value.
- **Hydroxyl Group Influence**:
  - **Oc1ccc(O)cc1** (property = 0.266) has two OH groups on a phenyl ring, contributing positively.
  - **Oc1cccc2ncccc12** (property = -0.756) has an OH group but a fused heterocyclic system with a negative value.

### Synthesis of Observations:
- The presence of **two Cl atoms** and a **heterocyclic aromatic ring** tends to push the property toward positive values (e.g., 0.3–0.8 range).
- The **OH group** adds some polarity but may not dominate over the Cl and heterocyclic effects.
- The **bulkiness** of the molecule (two phenyl rings and a heterocycle) is similar to some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., 0.794 for the highly chlorinated bulky molecule).

### Predicted Property:
Given the combination of features, the property value is likely in the **positive mid-range**, similar to molecules like **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (0.794) or **Nc1nc[nH]n1** (0.659). However, the heterocycle here is less polar than an imidazole, and the Cl substituents are balanced by the OH group.

**Final Prediction**: **0.55**  
*(This is a reasonable estimate based on the structural similarities and trends in the given examples.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 0.13935232112300674
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with polar functional groups (e.g., nitro groups `N(=O)=O`, carbonyls `C=O`, hydroxyls `OH`, halogens) tend to have higher (less negative) property values.
   - Nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., `Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C`) have very negative values.
   - Esters (e.g., `CC(=O)OCC`, value: -0.254) and aldehydes (e.g., `CCCCCC=O`, value: -0.152) have moderately negative to near-zero values.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains tend to decrease the property value (more negative), but the effect is modulated by polar groups.
   - Branching or cyclic structures can further decrease the value (e.g., `C1CCCCCCC1`, value: -2.194).

3. **Specific Comparisons**:
   - `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl butyrate): -0.254  
     This is an ester with a 4-carbon chain and an ethoxy group, similar to butyl formate (`CCCCOC=O`), but butyl formate has a shorter ester group (formate vs. butyrate).
   - `CCCCCC=O` (hexanal): -0.152  
     This is a linear aldehyde, which is somewhat comparable to butyl formate (both have a carbonyl group and aliphatic chain).
   - `CC(=O)OCC` (ethyl acetate): Not in the list, but similar to `CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3...` (more complex ester, value: 1.845). Simpler esters tend to have values around -0.2 to -0.3.

### Prediction for `CCCCOC=O`:
- Butyl formate is an ester with a 4-carbon chain and a formyl group (`OC=O`). 
- Compared to `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl butyrate, -0.254), butyl formate has a shorter ester moiety (formate vs. butyrate), which might slightly increase the property value (less negative). 
- Compared to `CCCCCC=O` (hexanal, -0.152), the ester group in butyl formate is more polar than the aldehyde, which could also push the value higher.

Given these comparisons, the property value for `CCCCOC=O` is likely **between -0.15 and -0.25**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.18**  

This balances the trends from similar molecules in the dataset.
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.6157838526221131
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for **ClCCl** (dichloromethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Compounds**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane): Property value = **0.36309076**
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene): Property value = **-2.87070365**
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (dichlorobenzene): Property value = **-0.01140979**
   - **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(NC=O)N1C=CN(C=C1)C(NC=O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: Property value = **0.96957522**

   Chlorinated compounds show a wide range of property values, but simple aliphatic chlorinated compounds (like ClCCCl) tend to have positive values (~0.36), while aromatic chlorinated compounds can vary significantly.

2. **Small Aliphatic Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of **0.36309076**.
   - **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) is structurally simpler (one fewer carbon than ClCCCl) and less polarizable. 

3. **Polarity and Size**:
   - Smaller, less polarizable molecules (e.g., ClCCCl) tend to have lower positive values.
   - Larger or more polarizable chlorinated molecules (e.g., hexachlorobenzene) can have very negative values.

### Prediction for ClCCl:
- **ClCCl** is smaller and less polarizable than **ClCCCl**, so its property value should be slightly lower than that of **ClCCCl** (0.36309076).
- It is also less polarizable than **ClCCCl**, which might reduce the property value further.
- However, it is still a simple aliphatic chlorinated compound, so the value should remain positive but closer to zero.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate for **ClCCl** is:  
**0.25** (slightly lower than ClCCCl but still positive).  

However, looking at the examples more carefully, **ClCCCl** is 0.363, and **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (dichlorobenzene) is -0.011. Since **ClCCl** is simpler than both, but closer to **ClCCCl**, a value slightly below 0.363 seems plausible.  

A refined estimate: **~0.30**.  

But to be more precise, since **ClCCl** is smaller and less polarizable than **ClCCCl**, a value of **0.28** seems reasonable.  

### Final Predicted Property Value for ClCCl:  
**0.28**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data. If the property is, for example, logP or another molecular descriptor, the reasoning might differ slightly.)  

---  
**Answer:** The predicted property value for **ClCCl** is **0.28**.
==================================================
Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.25707466806407114
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Hydroxyl (-OH) Groups**:
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol) has a property value of **0.26663563**.
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (a methyl-substituted phenol) has a property value of **-1.81918561**.
   - The presence of -OH on an aromatic ring tends to give a moderately positive or negative value, depending on other substituents.

2. **Methyl Substituents on Aromatic Rings**:
   - **Cc1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O)** (trinitrotoluene-like) has a very negative value (**-1.87461327**), but this is likely due to the nitro groups.
   - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (a methyl-substituted polyaromatic) has a value of **-0.61451777**.
   - Methyl groups alone on aromatics do not seem to drastically shift the property value.

3. **Combination of -OH and Methyl on Aromatics**:
   - The molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is a dimethylphenol (specifically, 2,5-dimethylphenol). 
   - Comparing to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (which is likely 2,6-dimethylphenol or similar), the value is **-1.81918561**. However, this has two methyl groups adjacent to the -OH, which may sterically or electronically affect the property more strongly.
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** has methyl groups at positions 2 and 5, which are less sterically hindered relative to the -OH, so the property value might be less negative.

4. **Other Phenols**:
   - Simple phenol (**Oc1ccccc1**) is not in the dataset, but **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol) is **0.26663563**, suggesting that additional -OH groups can increase the value.
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol) is **0.0212474**, showing that electron-withdrawing groups reduce the value compared to plain phenol.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (sterically hindered dimethylphenol) is **-1.81918561**,
- **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol) is **0.26663563**,
- **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is less sterically hindered than the first example but has no additional -OH like the second,

A reasonable estimate for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** would be between these two values, closer to the hindered dimethylphenol but less negative. 

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.9** (approximate, based on interpolation between the given examples). 

However, looking more closely, **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** is likely a more sterically hindered isomer (e.g., 2,6-dimethylphenol), whereas **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is 2,5-dimethylphenol, which is less hindered. Thus, the value should be less negative. 

A refined estimate: **-0.6**. 

But comparing to **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (methyl-substituted polyaromatic, **-0.61451777**), which lacks -OH, adding -OH might bring it closer to **-0.3**. 

Given the uncertainty, a conservative estimate is:  
**-0.5**. 

### Final Predicted Property Value for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**:  
**-0.5** (approximate). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on trends in the data. The true value could vary depending on the specific property's dependence on molecular features.)

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.09597169105978369
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = 0.40445131  
     (Highly chlorinated biphenyl-like structure)
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = 0.63682616  
     (Similar to the target molecule, with even more chlorination)
   - **Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl**: Property = -2.56331657  
     (Chlorinated phenol, but with an -OH group, which significantly lowers the property)

2. **Key Features**:
   - The property tends to increase with the number of chlorine atoms on aromatic rings, especially in biphenyl-like structures.
   - The absence of polar groups (like -OH or -NO2) tends to result in higher property values for chlorinated aromatics.
   - Symmetry and additional chlorination seem to increase the property (e.g., 0.63682616 for the heavily chlorinated biphenyl).

3. **Target Molecule**:  
   **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**  
   - This is a chlorinated biphenyl with 5 chlorine atoms (less than the example with 0.63682616 but more than the one with 0.40445131).
   - No polar substituents (like -OH or -NO2) are present, so the property should be in the higher range.

### Prediction:
The target molecule is structurally similar to the two chlorinated biphenyl examples but with an intermediate number of chlorine atoms. Given:
- 0.40445131 (4 Cl atoms, biphenyl + phenyl substitution)
- 0.63682616 (7 Cl atoms, heavily chlorinated biphenyl)

The target has 5 Cl atoms, so we expect a value between these two, likely closer to 0.5. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property: 0.52**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is based purely on the trend in the given data.)

1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Alkenes**:
   - **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (7-carbon chain with a terminal aldehyde): **-1.50580041**
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (9-carbon chain with a terminal alkene): **-2.19663011**
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched hydrocarbon): **-1.85884382**
   - **CCCCCCCC** (linear octane): **-1.85083746**
   - **CC(=O)C** (small ketone): Not directly given, but similar small polar groups tend to have less negative values.

   Hydrocarbons (especially longer/branched ones) tend to have negative property values, with more negative values for longer chains or less branching. Alkenes (C=C) seem to further decrease the property value compared to saturated analogs.

2. **Small/Branched Alkenes**:
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a small branched alkene (isoprene). It has:
     - A double bond (like **CCCCCCCCC=C**, but much shorter).
     - Branching (like **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**, but smaller).

   Given that smaller/branched molecules tend to have less negative values than long chains, and alkenes reduce the value further, I estimate its property value to be between the branched hydrocarbon (**-1.85884382**) and the small polar molecules (e.g., **CC(=O)C**, which would likely be less negative).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC=C(C)C** is structurally simpler than most examples, but closest to **CC(C)=CC3C...** (property **1.31971963**), though that molecule is much larger and has additional functional groups. 
   - Simpler alkenes like **COC(=O)C=C** (property **0.65622823**) have polar groups, so they are not directly comparable.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Small hydrocarbons: ~ -1.0 to -2.0.
- Branching reduces negativity slightly.
- Alkenes reduce the value further but not as drastically in small molecules.

For **CC=C(C)C**, a reasonable estimate is slightly less negative than **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (-1.85884382) due to its smaller size but more negative than very small polar molecules.

**Predicted property value: -1.65** (approximate, based on interpolation of trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given data.)

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.6157838526221131
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property of **ClCCl** (dichloromethane):

### Observations from the Data:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have property values that are moderately positive or near zero. For example:
     - `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a value of **1.00955715** (highly chlorinated).
     - `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) has a value of **0.10466929**.
     - `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` has a value of **-0.38326473** (fewer chlorines and an OH group).
   - The presence of chlorines does not strongly push the property toward extreme negative values unless paired with other functional groups (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has **-4.16563914**, but this is likely due to the amide and dimethylamino groups).

2. **Small, Simple Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) has a value of **0.10466929**.
   - `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` (a complex polychlorinated hydrocarbon) has **1.13908207**.
   - Simpler chlorinated molecules like `ClCCl` (dichloromethane) would likely have a value closer to zero but slightly positive due to the electronegativity of chlorine.

3. **Comparison to Other Halogenated Examples**:
   - Fluorinated compounds (e.g., `C(F)(F)F`) tend to have more negative values, but chlorinated compounds are less extreme.

### Prediction for ClCCl:
- Dichloromethane is a small, symmetrically chlorinated molecule with no other functional groups. Given the examples:
  - It is simpler than `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (which has **0.10466929**), so its value should be slightly lower.
  - It is more chlorinated than `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (which has **-0.38326473**), but lacks the OH group that contributes to negativity.

Thus, a reasonable estimate for **ClCCl** is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.05** (slightly positive, near zero but less than tetrachloroethylene).  

(Note: If the property is logP or a similar hydrophobicity metric, this aligns with dichloromethane's moderate polarity.)

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -1.043314942092728
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** has a property value of **-1.03264228**. This is a chlorinated phenol with three chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring.
   - **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** (brominated analog) has a property value of **-1.63398316**, suggesting that halogens (Cl/Br) on aromatic rings tend to decrease the property value, with bromine having a more pronounced effect than chlorine.

2. **Comparison to the Target Molecule**:
   - The target molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is very similar to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (given example), but with a slightly different substitution pattern (positions of Cl atoms). 
   - The given example has Cl at positions 2, 4, and 6 (ortho and para to OH), while the target molecule likely has Cl at positions 2, 3, and 5 (two ortho and one meta to OH). 

3. **Effect of Substitution Pattern**:
   - The property value is influenced by the number and position of halogens. More electronegative or sterically hindered positions may slightly alter the value.
   - Since the substitution pattern is slightly different but the number of Cl atoms is the same, we can expect the property value to be close to the given example (**-1.03264228**), possibly slightly lower due to the meta chlorine (less stabilizing interaction with the OH group).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarity to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (-1.03264228), the property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is likely in the same range but slightly more negative due to the less favorable substitution pattern. 

**Predicted value: -1.15** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

However, since the given example is almost identical, the safest prediction is to assume it is very close to the provided example. Thus, the predicted value is:

**-1.03264228** (same as the given example, as the substitution pattern difference is minor). 

For consistency with the data, I will stick with the value of the closest analog:  
**Predicted property value: -1.03264228**.  

(If you were expecting a different reasoning or adjustment, let me know! The key takeaway is that the value should be very close to the provided example due to structural similarity.)

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 2.162292055250614
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to predict the property value. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Molecule to Predict:
**SMILES:** `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67`

### Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Ether and Hydroxyl Substituents**: 
   - `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)` indicates a benzene ring with methoxy (-OCH3) and hydroxyl (-OH) groups. Similar to `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = 0.0212474) but with more substitutions.
   - The presence of multiple -OCH3 and -OH groups tends to decrease the property value (as seen in `Cc1cc(C)c(O)c(C)c1` with property = -0.71995884).

2. **Complex Polycyclic Structure with Sugar-like Moieties**:
   - The molecule contains multiple fused rings and sugar-like fragments (e.g., `OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O`). 
   - Similar to `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (property = 0.68601454), but more complex and with additional aromatic systems.

3. **Lactone or Ester Group**:
   - `COC2=O` suggests a lactone or ester, which is polar and may slightly increase the property value (similar to `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` with property = 1.43844159, but less extreme due to smaller size).

4. **Fused Aromatic and Heterocyclic Systems**:
   - The `c7cc5OCOc5cc67` part indicates a benzodioxole-like structure, which is somewhat similar to `O=c2[nH]c1CCCc1c(=O)n2C3CCCCC3` (property = 0.47913415).

### Comparison with Examples:
- The molecule is most similar to complex polycyclic structures with polar groups (e.g., sugars, esters, aromatic systems). 
- Examples like `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (0.68601454) and `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (1.18153753) suggest values in the 0.5–1.2 range for such complexity.
- However, the additional aromatic systems and substitutions may lower the value slightly compared to purely sugar-like or ester-dominated molecules.

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the balance of polar groups, aromatic systems, and complexity, the predicted property value is:

**0.75** (approximate, likely between 0.7 and 0.8 based on the examples). 

### Final Answer:
**0.75**

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.41989385649545286
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** (with S and N atoms) fused to a **pyrimidine-like ring** (with N and C=O groups). This is somewhat similar to heterocyclic structures in the examples, which often have moderate to low property values.
2. **Substituents**: 
   - A **methylthio group (S-CH3)**, which is moderately hydrophobic but not highly polar.
   - A **tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)**, which is bulky and hydrophobic.
   - A **carbamoyl-like fragment (c(=O)n1N)**, which introduces polarity and hydrogen-bonding potential.
3. **Polarity**: The molecule has both polar (C=O, N-H) and nonpolar (tert-butyl, S-CH3) regions, suggesting intermediate polarity.

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Similar molecules** with heterocycles and mixed polar/nonpolar groups (e.g., `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C`, property = **0.22294499**) have values around **0.2–0.5**.
- The presence of the **thioether (S-CH3)** and **tert-butyl** groups may slightly lower the property compared to purely polar heterocycles.
- The **C=O and N-H** groups increase polarity, but the bulky tert-butyl group counteracts this.

### Prediction:
Given the balance of polar and nonpolar features, the property value is likely in the range of **0.1 to 0.3**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.18**  

*(This is based on interpolation from similar structures in the dataset, accounting for the slightly reduced polarity due to the tert-butyl group.)*

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -1.0072754241941122
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Structural features**:
   - Aromatic ring (benzene): Present in many examples, often contributing negatively to the property (e.g., `c1ccccc1` is part of many negative values).
   - Ester group (`COC=O`): Similar to `COCC(=O)O` or `CCOC(=O)` fragments in the dataset.
   - No strongly polar or charged groups (e.g., no `OH`, `NH2`, `SO3H`), but the ester is moderately polar.

2. **Similar molecules**:
   - `COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C` has a property of **0.34384269**. This is an ester with additional substitutions.
   - `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C` (cyclic imide) has **-1.82832627**, but this is more polar.
   - `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl butyrate) has **-0.84471038**, which is a simpler ester.
   - `CCCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl pentanoate) has **-0.84471038**, same as above, suggesting alkyl esters trend toward modest negative values.

3. **Key observations**:
   - Aromatic esters (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C`) tend to have more negative values than aliphatic esters.
   - The presence of the benzene ring likely lowers the property compared to pure aliphatic esters.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Ethyl benzoate (`CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1`) is an aromatic ester, so its value should be more negative than aliphatic esters but not as extreme as highly polar or polycyclic aromatic systems (e.g., `o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` has **-4.18184136**).
   - A reasonable estimate is between **-0.8 and -1.5**, leaning toward the middle of this range.

**Final predicted property value**: **-1.1** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures). 

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. If the property is, for example, logP or solubility, the value might differ slightly.)*

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -1.9008609657090523
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkyl Halides (e.g., CI, Br-substituted):**
   - **CI (iodomethane):** Property value = 0.09231608 (relatively small magnitude, near zero).
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (bromonaphthalene):** Property value = -4.62521034 (very negative, but this is an aromatic system with a large conjugated system, which may not be directly comparable).
   - **Cl-substituted aliphatics (e.g., ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)...):** Property values are positive or near zero unless heavily substituted or part of complex systems.

2. **Linear Alkanes vs. Functionalized Alkanes:**
   - **CCCC (=O)CCC (4-heptanone):** Property value = -0.64949809.
   - **CCCCC (=O)CCCC (5-nonanone):** Property value = -3.91556748 (more negative with longer chain).
   - **CCCCCCCO (1-octanol):** Property value = -0.93736184 (similar to 1-bromoheptane in chain length and terminal functional group).

3. **Bromine vs. Other Halogens:**
   - Bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine but less than iodine. Its effect on the property is likely intermediate.

4. **Chain Length:**
   - Longer chains tend to have more negative values when terminated with polar groups (e.g., OH, Br), as seen in **CCCCCCCO** (-0.93736184).

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCBr**:
- **CCCCCCCBr** is a linear 7-carbon chain with a terminal bromine, similar in structure to **CCCCCCCO** (1-octanol, 8-carbon chain with terminal OH). The property value for **CCCCCCCO** is -0.93736184.
- Bromine is less polar than OH but still introduces polarity. The slightly shorter chain (7 vs. 8 carbons) may offset this slightly, leading to a less negative value.
- Comparing to **CI (iodomethane)**, where the property is near zero, **CCCCCCCBr** is a much larger molecule, so the value should be more negative.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCCCCBr** is slightly less negative than **CCCCCCCO**, but still negative due to the polarizable Br and chain length. A plausible prediction is:

**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr: -0.75** (interpolated between **CCCCCCCO** and smaller halides like **CI**). 

This aligns with the trend of longer chains with terminal polar groups having moderately negative values.
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.0537880379128517
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property value for **CO (methanol)**:

1. **Simple, polar molecules with small size and hydroxyl groups** tend to have negative or low-positive property values in the dataset. For example:
   - **CCCCOC=O (butyraldehyde-like)**: 0.13935232  
   - **CC(C)CO (branched alcohol)**: 0.17267971  
   - **OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O (sugar-like)**: -0.9474109  
   - **OC1CCCCCC1 (cyclohexanol)**: -1.02476125  

   Methanol (CO) is even simpler than these, with just one carbon and a hydroxyl group. Its small size and high polarity would likely place it in the lower range of the observed values.

2. **Molecules with single functional groups (e.g., OH) and no aromaticity or complex branching** tend to have property values between **-1.0 and 0.2** in the dataset. Methanol fits this category.

3. Comparing to **CCC (propane)**, which has no functional groups and a value of **0.69923148**, methanol's polarity would significantly reduce the property value.

### Predicted property value for **CO (methanol)**:  
**-0.45**  

This estimate balances its simplicity (pushing the value lower) and polarity (also reducing the value), while being consistent with trends in the dataset for small alcohols.
