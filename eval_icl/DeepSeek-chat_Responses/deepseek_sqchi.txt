SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.3967430043991601
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here are some key observations:

1. **Long hydrocarbon chains** (e.g., `CCCCCC`, `CCCCCCCC(C)O`) tend to have **negative property values** (around -0.2 to -0.7).
2. **Ester groups (`C(=O)OC`)** appear in some molecules with **moderate positive values** (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` has a value of 0.56571472).
3. **Polar or functionalized groups** (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl, halogens) can influence the property value either positively or negatively depending on their placement and interaction with the rest of the molecule.

The molecule in question is:  
**`CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`**  

This is a **long hydrocarbon chain (10 carbons) with an ester group (`C(=O)OC`)** at the end.  

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (from examples) has a value of **0.56571472**.
- `CCOC(=O)CC` (ethyl propanoate) has a value of **0.20031189**.
- `CCCCCC` (hexane) has a value of **-0.22220747**.

The ester group seems to **increase the property value** compared to pure hydrocarbons. Since the given molecule is very similar to `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (just two carbons shorter), we can expect a **slightly lower but still positive value**.

### Predicted property value:
**~0.50** (slightly lower than the 0.56571472 of the longer-chain ester).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured, this is an educated guess based on structural similarity and trends in the data.)*  

### Final answer:  
**Predicted property value for `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`: ~0.50** (likely between 0.45 and 0.55).  

*(If this is a logP prediction or another specific property, the reasoning may adjust accordingly, but the trend holds.)*

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.5520952765663678
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic System with Heteroatoms**: The molecule contains a fused aromatic system with oxygen (O) and nitrogen (NH) in a lactam-like structure (oc(=O)[nH]). This is similar to the following examples:
   - **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property: -0.39458012): A 5-membered ring with sulfur and carbonyl groups.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)** (property: 0.95549283): A cyclic urea/imide with multiple carbonyls.
   - **Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C** (property: -0.72275535): A substituted imidazole with carbonyl and chloro groups.

2. **Chlorine Substituent**: The presence of a chlorine atom on the aromatic ring is seen in many examples, where it often increases the property value slightly (e.g., **ClC=C** has a high value of 2.29226887, while **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** has 0.13245348).

3. **Lactam/Carbonyl Group**: The **oc(=O)[nH]** moiety is electron-withdrawing and polar, similar to the cyclic imides/ureas in the examples. These groups tend to reduce the property value (e.g., negative values for most cyclic carbonyl-containing molecules).

4. **Fused Ring System**: The molecule is a benzofuran-like structure with an additional lactam, which adds complexity but is somewhat analogous to **Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32** (property: -0.48681965).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analogs are cyclic carbonyl-containing structures with aromatic rings and heteroatoms, which typically have property values in the range of **-0.7 to 0.9**.
- The chlorine substituent may push the value slightly higher than purely carbonyl-dominated structures (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)** has 0.95549283, but with more carbonyls).
- The **oc(=O)[nH]** group is less electron-withdrawing than a pure imide, so the value may not be as negative as **-0.72275535**.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the electron-withdrawing carbonyl/chlorine and the aromatic system, a reasonable estimate is:  
**0.25** (with uncertainty in the range of 0.0 to 0.5).

However, looking more closely at the examples, **O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1** (hydantoin-like) has a value of **0.95549283**, while **Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C** (more substituted) is **-0.72275535**. The given molecule is intermediate in polarity and substitution, so a value closer to **0.1 to 0.3** is plausible.

### Final Prediction:
**0.15** (specific value chosen based on structural similarity to mid-range examples).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend of the given data.)

Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.0784956081736767
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (which is isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitrogen-containing functional groups**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) or nitroso groups (`N=O`) tend to have property values in the **negative to slightly positive range**.
   - Example: `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` has a value of **-0.5628518**.
   - Example: `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` has a value of **0.49770616** (note the presence of multiple heteroatoms and aromaticity).

2. **Aliphatic nitro compounds**:
   - Simple aliphatic nitro compounds (like `CC(C)N(=O)=O`) are not explicitly in the examples, but similar aliphatic nitro groups (e.g., `N(=O)=O` attached to non-aromatic carbons) suggest **moderately negative values**.

3. **Substituent effects**:
   - The presence of alkyl groups (e.g., `CC(C)`) tends to slightly increase the property value compared to purely aromatic nitro compounds, but not drastically.

4. **Comparison to similar molecules**:
   - `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` (-0.5628518) has a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring, but the aliphatic chain (`CCO`) may offset the value slightly.
   - `NC(=O)NC1NC(=O)NC1=O` (-0.09718231) has multiple amide/nitro-like groups, but the property is less negative due to the complexity.

### Prediction for `CC(C)N(=O)=O`:
Given that:
- The nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) is attached to an aliphatic carbon (`CC(C)`), 
- There are no strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups nearby, 
- The molecule is simple and non-aromatic,

the property value is likely in the **moderately negative range**, similar to other aliphatic nitro compounds but slightly less negative than aromatic nitro compounds.

### Estimated Property Value:
**-0.45** (approximate, based on trends from the examples).

This is a reasonable estimate given the data, though exact values would require more specific examples or a model.

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 8.59497399303287
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and the presence of carbonyl groups or other polar moieties. The property tends to be higher for molecules with multiple rings, conjugated systems, or highly polar/halogenated substituents, while simpler aliphatic or less polar structures tend to have lower (often negative) values.

Let's analyze the target molecule:  
**CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**

### Key features:
1. **Polycyclic structure**: The molecule contains multiple fused rings (steroid-like framework), which increases complexity and likely contributes to a higher property value.
2. **Functional groups**: 
   - Two carbonyl groups (C=O): One in a ring (cyclic ketone) and one as a terminal aldehyde (C(=O)CO).
   - A hydroxyl group (OH).
   - These polar groups will increase the property value.
3. **Size and branching**: The molecule is large and highly branched, similar to some of the high-value examples (e.g., the steroid-like molecule with a value of 7.74187144).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The molecule **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (a steroid-like structure with two carbonyls) has a value of **7.74187144**.
- The target molecule is even more polar due to the additional hydroxyl and aldehyde groups, which would likely increase the property further.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to the highest-value example but with additional polar groups, the property value should be **higher than 7.74187144**. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **8.0 to 8.5**. 

For specificity, I predict:  
**Predicted property value: 8.214**  

This accounts for the increased polarity and complexity compared to the closest example.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.3156703862569889
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). Aromatic rings with halogens (e.g., Cl, Br, F) are present in many examples, and their contributions vary:
   - Cl-substituted aromatics (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, -0.25478014; Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1, -0.72263899) tend to have moderately negative values.
   - F-substituted aromatics (e.g., FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, -0.06147195) have less negative values.

2. **Amide linkages**: The molecule has two amide groups (C(=O)N), which are polar and can influence the property. Examples with amides or similar polar groups:
   - NC(=O)c1cccnc1 (0.15937794) has a slightly positive value.
   - NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1 (-0.49537193) has a negative value.

3. **Halogen substitutions**: The presence of F and Cl atoms introduces electronegativity and polarity. Fluorine tends to reduce the magnitude of negative values compared to chlorine (e.g., FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, -0.06147195 vs. Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, -0.25478014).

4. **Size and complexity**: The molecule is larger than most examples but not as large as the very high-value cases (e.g., long alkanes or complex steroids). Its property value is likely in the low-to-moderate range.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (-0.25478014) and **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1** (-0.25478014): Simple dichlorobenzenes with moderately negative values.
- **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (-0.06147195): A trifluoromethyl benzene with a less negative value.
- **NC(=O)c1cccnc1** (0.15937794): An amide-substituted heteroaromatic with a slightly positive value.
- **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (-0.49537193): A thiourea-substituted aromatic with a more negative value.

Given the combination of:
- Two aromatic rings (one with F, one with Cl),
- Two polar amide linkages, and
- No extreme features (e.g., very long aliphatic chains or highly conjugated systems),

the property value is likely slightly negative but not as large in magnitude as the dichlorobenzenes due to the fluorine and amide contributions.

### Predicted Value:
A reasonable estimate is **-0.35**. This accounts for:
- The negative contribution from the Cl-substituted ring (~-0.25),
- The less negative contribution from the F-substituted ring (~-0.06), and
- The polar amide groups (net slight negative effect).

Thus, the predicted property value for **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2** is **-0.35**.
==================================================
Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.1993876030716308
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropoxypropane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Size**: 
   - The molecule is an ether (**R-O-R'**) with a propyl group (**CCC**) and an isopropyl group (**C(C)C**). 
   - Ethers in the dataset (e.g., **CCOC(=O)CC** with a value of 0.20031189 and **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** with -0.51703172) show moderate property values, but the presence of additional polar groups (like =O or P=O) complicates direct comparison.
   - Simpler ethers or alcohols (e.g., **CCCCCO** with 0.13835058 and **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** with -0.38900569) suggest that larger aliphatic chains tend to have lower values unless other functional groups are present.

2. **Branching and Aliphatic Chains**:
   - The molecule is branched (isopropyl group), and branching often reduces the property value compared to linear chains (e.g., **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** with -0.73008271 vs. **CCCCCC1CCCC1** with -0.63328328).
   - The propyl group is a short chain, which might slightly increase the value compared to longer chains.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (similar branched alcohol): -0.38900569.
   - **CCCCCO** (linear alcohol): 0.13835058.
   - **CCCOC(C)C** is an ether, not an alcohol, but structurally similar to these. Ethers are less polar than alcohols, which might reduce the property value slightly compared to alcohols.

4. **Absence of Strongly Influential Groups**:
   - No halogens, aromatic rings, or highly polar groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl) are present, which rules out very high or very low values.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for **CCCOC(C)C** is likely in the range of **-0.2 to 0.2**. A reasonable estimate, considering its similarity to **CCCCCO** (0.138) but with branching (which tends to lower the value), is:

**Predicted property value: -0.05** (approximately). 

This is a rough estimate based on the dataset's trends, where simple branched aliphatic ethers tend to have values close to zero but slightly negative due to reduced polarity and increased branching.

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: -0.4533650611427826
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Heterocyclic core**: A substituted uracil-like ring (with two carbonyl groups and a bromine substituent).
2. **Alkyl substituent**: A branched butyl group (`CCC(C)`) attached to the nitrogen.
3. **Bromine atom**: A heavy halogen substituent on the ring.
4. **Polar functional groups**: Two carbonyl groups (`C=O`) and an `[nH]` (imino group), making it polar.

### Comparison to similar molecules in the dataset:
- **Nc1nccs1** (property = 0.245): Thiazole ring with an amino group. Less polar than our molecule, but similar heterocyclic nature.
- **CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1** (property = -0.745): Substituted imidazole with chlorines and alkyl groups. More polar but structurally similar.
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** (property = -0.299): Chlorinated biphenyl, less polar but with halogens.
- **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property = -0.747): Brominated aromatic with an amide group. Similar halogen but simpler structure.

### Observations:
- The presence of **bromine** and **carbonyl groups** increases polarity but may not dominate over the alkyl group's hydrophobicity.
- The **branched alkyl chain** (`CCC(C)`) suggests some hydrophobic contribution, similar to other alkylated molecules with negative property values.
- The **uracil-like core** is polar but balanced by the alkyl group.

### Predicted property:
Given the balance between polar (bromine, carbonyls) and nonpolar (alkyl) features, the property value is likely **negative but not extremely low**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.65** (similar to molecules like `CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1` or `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` but slightly less negative due to the additional carbonyls).

### Final answer:
**-0.65** (approximate predicted value).
==================================================
Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.7550821815025827
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have negative property values (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1** would likely be similar to **CCCCCCC**, which is -0.55050526).
   - Fused aromatic systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatics like **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67**) have much higher positive values (4.49665138), likely due to extended conjugation and rigidity.

2. **Biphenyl-like Structures**:
   - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a phenanthrene-like structure with a nitrogen substituent) has a value of 0.63499775.
   - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (a large fused aromatic) has a very high value (4.49665138).
   - Biphenyl is simpler than these but has two connected aromatic rings, so its value should be between simple aromatics (negative) and fused polycyclics (positive).

3. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Substituents like NO2, Cl, or bulky groups can influence the property, but biphenyl has no substituents, so it should be closer to neutral or slightly positive.

4. **Conjugation and Rigidity**:
   - Biphenyl has some conjugation between the two rings (though not as much as fused systems), which may push the property toward slightly positive values.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Simple aromatics are negative (e.g., **CCCCCCC** is -0.55050526).
- Fused or highly conjugated systems are positive (e.g., phenanthrene-like is 0.63499775).
- Biphenyl is intermediate in conjugation but not fused, its value should be slightly positive but lower than fused systems.

**Estimated property for biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2): ~0.2 to 0.5**.

Looking at the examples, the closest structurally is **C1CCc2ccccc2C1** (tetralin, a partially hydrogenated fused system) with -0.75042299, but biphenyl is more conjugated. Another close example is **CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane) with 0.09998256, but biphenyl is more conjugated. 

Given the lack of exact matches, a reasonable estimate is:
**Predicted property: 0.35**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data. If the property is something like "logP" or "polarizability," the reasoning might differ.) 

However, reviewing the examples again, **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (0.63499775) is a fused triaromatic with a nitrogen, while biphenyl is simpler. Adjusting downward, a better estimate might be:
**Final predicted property: 0.25**. 

But to be precise, given the data, I'd lean toward:
**Predicted property: 0.30**. 

(If forced to pick a specific value from the trends, I'd say **0.30** is a reasonable interpolation.) 

However, looking back, the smallest positive value in the examples is **0.09998256** (for **CCC(C)(C)C**), and biphenyl is more conjugated, so **0.30** seems plausible. 

**Final answer: 0.30**. 

(Note: This is a heuristic prediction; the actual value could vary depending on the property's definition.) 

---

**Correction after re-evaluating**: The molecule **C1CCc2ccccc2C1** (tetralin) is -0.75042299, which is partially saturated. Biphenyl is fully aromatic but not fused, so its value should be higher than tetralin but lower than fused aromatics like phenanthrene (0.63499775). 

Thus, a better estimate is **0.10 to 0.20**. 

Given the examples, the closest unsubstituted biphenyl-like system is not present, but **CCC(C)(C)C** is 0.09998256, and biphenyl is more conjugated, so **0.15** seems reasonable. 

**Final revised prediction: 0.15**. 

---

Given the uncertainty, if I had to pick a single value, I'd say:  
**Predicted property for biphenyl: 0.15**. 

(But acknowledging that this is an interpolation and the true value could differ.) 

---

**After further reflection**: The property might be **molar refractivity** or a similar bulk property. Biphenyl is larger than benzene but not as large as fused systems. Given that **C1CCc2ccccc2C1** is -0.75 and **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** is 0.63, biphenyl is likely in between. 

**Final answer: 0.25**. 

---

Given the time spent, I'll settle on:  
**Predicted property: 0.25**.
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.0059558658010702556
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as size, polarity, functional groups, and aromaticity. The molecule in question is **CCCCS** (1-butanethiol), which is a linear aliphatic thiol with a sulfur atom at the end.

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Small aliphatic molecules** (e.g., **CC(C)I**, **CC(O)C(C)(C)C**) tend to have property values close to zero or slightly positive/negative.
2. **Polar or functionalized aliphatic chains** (e.g., **CCNC(=S)NCC**, **CCCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**) tend to have negative values.
3. **Sulfur-containing molecules** in the examples (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O**, **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**) show a range of values, but simple thiols or sulfides are not explicitly represented.
4. **Linear alkanes** (e.g., **CCC1CCCCC1**, **CCCCCC(C)C**) tend to have moderately negative values.

### Prediction for **CCCCS**:
- The molecule is a small aliphatic thiol, similar in size to **CC(C)I** or **CC(O)C(C)(C)C**, but with a polarizable sulfur atom.
- Sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, so the polarity is moderate.
- No aromaticity or complex branching is present.
- Based on the trend, small polar aliphatic molecules tend to have values slightly below zero.

### Estimated property value:
Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for **CCCCS** would be around **-0.3 to -0.5**. A specific estimate could be:

**Predicted property value: -0.42**  

This aligns with the behavior of similar-sized polar aliphatic molecules in the dataset.
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.4471820734605699
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or structural features that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Size**: Larger, more hydrophobic molecules (e.g., alkanes, aromatic rings with few polar groups) tend to have lower (more negative) values. For example:
   - **CCCC/C=C/C**: -0.30858395 (linear alkene)
   - **CCC(C)(C)C**: -0.73008271 (branched alkane)
   - **CC(C)CC(C)O**: -0.13216489 (branched alcohol)

2. **Polar Functional Groups**: The presence of polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NH₂, -NO₂, halogens) can increase or decrease the property value depending on their nature and position. For example:
   - **Cc1cccc(O)c1**: 0.11600551 (phenol, slightly positive)
   - **Nc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: -0.03478007 (nitroaniline, near zero)
   - **ClC(Cl)Cl**: 0.81294313 (chloroform, highly positive)

3. **Branching vs. Linearity**: Branched alkanes tend to have more negative values than linear ones. For example:
   - **CC(C)C**: 0.09998256 (isobutane, slightly positive)
   - **CCC(C)(C)C**: -0.73008271 (more branched, more negative)

4. **Alcohols (-OH)**:
   - **CC(C)CC(C)O**: -0.13216489 (branched alcohol)
   - **CCCC(C)(O)CC**: -0.51391697 (tertiary alcohol, more negative)

### Analysis of **CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
- This is a **branched primary alcohol** (5-carbon chain with a tert-butyl group and a terminal -OH).
- Similar to **CC(C)CC(C)O** (property: -0.13216489) but with a longer/branched alkyl chain.
- The additional branching and size (compared to simpler alcohols) would likely make the property more negative.
- However, the terminal -OH is less sterically hindered than in **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (property: -0.51391697), so the value should be less negative than that.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, a reasonable estimate for **CCCC(C)(C)CO** would be between **-0.2 and -0.4**. A specific prediction could be:  
**-0.35** (reflecting the balance between branching and the polar -OH group). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.35** (approximate predicted value based on structural trends).

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.7060356736382951
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple benzene (**c1ccccc1**) has a relatively high positive value (**0.76385303**).
   - Adding alkyl substituents (e.g., methyl groups) to benzene tends to decrease the property value:
     - **Cc1cccc(C)c1C**: -0.4555042  
     - **Cc1ccc(C)cc1**: -0.14482026  
     - **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1**: -0.45185002  
   - Fused aromatic rings (e.g., naphthalene-like structures) tend to have negative values:
     - **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (methyl-substituted naphthalene) is structurally similar to **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (value: **-0.76599624**) and **c1ccc2ccccc2c1** (unsubstituted naphthalene, not in examples but likely negative).

2. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Methyl groups (**-CH3**) generally reduce the property value compared to unsubstituted aromatics.
   - The position and number of substituents matter. For example, **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (methyl on a fused ring) has a more negative value than **Cc1ccc(C)cc1** (methyl on benzene).

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is a methyl-substituted naphthalene (methyl on one benzene ring of naphthalene).
   - Compare to **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (value: **-0.76599624**), where the methyl is on the same ring as the fusion point. The structure is very similar, but the methyl position differs slightly.

### Prediction:
Given the strong similarity to **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (-0.76599624) and the general trend that adding methyl groups to fused aromatics reduces the property value, the predicted value for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** should be slightly less negative (since the methyl is not on the fused ring directly). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.65**  

(Note: Without more examples of methyl-naphthalenes, this is an approximate interpolation. The value likely falls between -0.45 and -0.75 based on the given data.)  

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at the difference between **c1ccccc1** (0.763) and **Cc1ccccc1** (not provided, but likely ~0.3-0.5 less), and comparing fused vs. non-fused systems, a more precise guess is:  
**Final predicted value: -0.68**  

However, the closest analog is **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (-0.766), so the answer is likely near this.  

**Final answer: -0.70** (rounded conservatively).  

But to match the precision of the given examples, we can suggest:  
**-0.72**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarity. For exact values, computational or empirical models would be needed.)  

However, the most direct comparison is **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (-0.766), and since **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is almost identical (methyl on the other ring), the value should be very close.  

**Final prediction: -0.76**  

But to avoid overfitting, I'll settle on:  
**Predicted property value: -0.73**  

(Note: The true value is likely between -0.70 and -0.80 based on the data.)  

Given the examples, the safest answer is:  
**-0.74**  

But the closest match is **-0.766**, so:  
**Predicted value: -0.75**  

After reconsidering, the most consistent estimate is:  
**-0.73**  

But to align with the given data, the best match is:  
**-0.76** (same as **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12**).  

Thus, the final answer is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.76**  

(Note: This matches the nearly identical example in the dataset.)

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: -0.09537691416508899
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic urea derivative with two carbonyl groups. This is similar to one of the provided examples:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** with a property value of **-0.69687824**.

2. **Substituents**: 
   - The given molecule has an additional **C(C)CCC** substituent on the hydantoin ring, making it bulkier than the reference example (which only has **CC=C**).
   - The **CC=C** group is retained, suggesting some similarity in electronic/steric effects.

3. **Polarity/Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule is polar due to the carbonyl groups and N-H bonds, but the bulky alkyl substituents (**C(C)CCC**) may reduce overall polarity compared to smaller polar molecules in the dataset.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The reference hydantoin derivative (**O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C**) has a value of **-0.69687824**.
- Adding a **C(C)CCC** group (more hydrophobic bulk) would likely further decrease the property value (make it more negative), as larger alkyl groups tend to reduce polarity/solubility-related properties in many cases (e.g., see **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** with **-0.38900569** vs. smaller alcohols with positive values).

However, the effect of the **CC=C** group (unsaturation) might partially offset this, as seen in other unsaturated molecules (e.g., **C1CCC=CC1** has **0.01168832**, which is less negative than saturated analogs).

### Prediction:
Given the reference hydantoin value (**-0.69687824**) and the added bulkiness of **C(C)CCC**, the property value is expected to be slightly more negative. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **-0.75 to -0.80**.

**Final predicted value: -0.76** (rounded to two decimal places for consistency with the provided data). 

This aligns with trends observed for similar bulky, low-polarity structures in the dataset (e.g., **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** at **-0.75376759** or **CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1** at **-0.75758**).

Iteration: 13
SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.06147195210714452
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the given molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene) in the context of the examples:

1. **Presence of a benzene ring (c1ccccc1)**: 
   - Simple benzene derivatives without polar substituents (e.g., CCC=C, C1CCCC1) tend to have property values around **0.1 to 1.5**.
   - Substituted benzenes with halogens or other groups can vary widely. For example:
     - Clc1ccc(I)cc1: **-0.655**
     - Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl: **1.413**
     - Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl: **0.126**

2. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**:
   - The CF3 group is highly electronegative and lipophilic. In the examples, highly halogenated or polar groups tend to push the property value toward **negative or modest positive values** (e.g., Cl-substituted benzenes range from -0.655 to 1.413).
   - No direct example of CF3 is given, but fluorine substituents are likely to have a similar effect to chlorine (electron-withdrawing).

3. **Combined effect**:
   - The CF3 group is more electronegative than Cl, so it may lower the property value compared to Cl-substituted benzenes.
   - The absence of additional polar or bulky substituents (unlike some of the higher-valued examples with multiple halogens or complex functional groups) suggests the value will not be extreme.

### Prediction:
Given the trends, **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is likely to have a property value in the range of **-0.5 to 0.5**. A reasonable estimate, considering the electronegativity of CF3 and the simplicity of the benzene ring, is:

**Predicted property value: -0.3**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. If the property is something like logP or solubility, the reasoning would adjust accordingly.)

Iteration: 14
SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.6189786656666524
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular properties such as **logP (logarithm of the partition coefficient between octanol and water)**, which measures hydrophobicity. The values range from negative (more hydrophilic) to positive (more hydrophobic).

The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar alcohol derivative (likely **sorbitol** or a similar polyol). This structure is highly polar due to the presence of multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups, which strongly favor water solubility over octanol. 

From the examples:
- **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (a similar polyol, likely **mannitol**) has a property value of **-0.58341103**.
- Other hydrophilic molecules with multiple -OH groups or polar groups tend to have negative values.

Given the even higher number of -OH groups in **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** (6 -OH groups vs. 6 in mannitol but with a cyclic structure), we can infer that it will be similarly or slightly more hydrophilic. 

### Predicted property value:  
**-0.65** (estimated range: -0.6 to -0.7, based on structural similarity to the polyol examples). 

This aligns with the trend where highly polar, water-soluble molecules have negative logP values.

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 10.990340751788011
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, particularly influenced by:

1. **Functional groups**: Presence of carbonyls (C=O), hydroxyls (OH), halogens (Cl, Br), and other polar groups often increases the property value.
2. **Ring systems and size**: Larger and more complex ring systems (especially polycyclic structures) tend to have higher values.
3. **Polarity and conjugation**: Extended conjugation or multiple polar groups can elevate the value.
4. **Molecular weight**: Heavier molecules often (but not always) have higher values.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**SMILES**: `CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C`  
This is a **steroid-like polycyclic structure** with:
- **Multiple rings** (4 fused rings, indicative of a steroid backbone).
- **Carbonyl groups (C=O)** in the side chain (`CC(=O)OCC(=O)`) and within the ring system (`=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C`).
- **Hydroxyl groups (OH)** attached to the rings (`C3(O)` and `C(O)`).
- **Conjugation** (`=CC(=O)C=C`).

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
1. **`CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C`** (Property: **10.16138853**)  
   Very similar steroid backbone with carbonyls and ester group (`CCC(=O)OC`). The target molecule has additional hydroxyls and a conjugated enone (`=CC(=O)C=C`), which may slightly increase polarity/complexity.

2. **`CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C`** (Property: **6.62571863**)  
   Smaller steroid-like structure with fewer functional groups. The target molecule is more elaborate.

3. **`OCC3OC(OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C(O)C3O`** (Property: **9.04595398**)  
   A highly functionalized sugar with multiple hydroxyls and a cyano group. The target molecule’s polycyclic core likely outweighs this in complexity.

### Prediction:
The target molecule’s **steroid core with conjugated enone, ester side chain, and hydroxyl groups** places it in the **higher range** of the examples. Its complexity is most comparable to `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (10.161), but with additional features that may modestly increase the value.

**Predicted Property Value: ~10.5**  
*(Likely between 10.1 and 11.0, given the structural similarities to the highest-valued examples.)*  

### Final Answer:
**10.5** (approximate)

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 6.348514010675742
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and the presence of polar or nonpolar groups. 

The molecule in question is:  
**CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**

### Key observations about the molecule:
1. **Steroid-like structure**: The molecule appears to be a steroid or steroid-like scaffold with multiple fused rings (tetracyclic structure).  
2. **Functional groups**:  
   - A carbonyl group (`C=O`).  
   - A hydroxyl group (`OH`).  
   - Mostly aliphatic (saturated hydrocarbon) character.  
3. **Complexity**: High due to the fused ring system and multiple substituents.  

### Comparison with similar examples:
- **OC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O** (property value: **3.60680524**):  
  This is a steroid-like molecule with two hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings. The property value is moderately high (~3.6).  
- **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O** (same as above, property: **3.60680524**).  
- **O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (property: **5.92728756**):  
  This has a more polar and complex structure with multiple carbonyls and aromatic rings, leading to a higher value (~5.9).  

Our molecule is less polar than the second example but has a similar steroid backbone with one hydroxyl and one carbonyl group.  

### Predicted property value:
Given its structural similarity to the first example but with slightly less polarity (only one `OH` and one `C=O`), the predicted value would be slightly lower than **3.60680524**.  

**Final prediction: ~3.2**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or a specific biological activity—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6400619741627114
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH3-CO-NH-)**: Present in the molecule (CC(=O)N-).
   - **Nitro group (NO2)**: Attached to the aromatic ring (N(=O)=O).
   - **Aromatic ring**: A benzene ring with substituents.

2. **Similar Molecules in the Dataset**:
   - **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1**: Contains an aldehyde (C=O) and methoxy (OCH3) on an aromatic ring. Property: **-0.257**.
   - **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: Nitrobenzene with a methoxy group. Property: **-0.310**.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1**: Nitrobenzene. Property: **0.163**.
   - **O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12**: Nitronaphthalene. Property: **-0.729**.
   - **CC(=O)NCc1ccccc1**: Acetamide attached to a phenyl group (no nitro). Not in the dataset, but similar to simpler aromatics.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Nitro groups tend to decrease the property value when attached to aromatic rings (compare nitrobenzene **0.163** vs. nitronaphthalene **-0.729**).
   - Acetamide (CH3-CO-NH-) is polar and may slightly decrease the property value compared to simpler aromatic systems.
   - The molecule is a nitro-substituted acetanilide (CH3-CO-NH-Ph-NO2), which combines the effects of both the acetamide and nitro groups.

4. **Comparison**:
   - Nitrobenzene: **0.163**.
   - Methoxy-nitrobenzene: **-0.310** (methoxy is electron-donating, nitro is electron-withdrawing).
   - Acetanilide (without nitro): Likely close to simple aromatics (e.g., **CC(C)c1ccccc1** has **-0.519**).
   - Adding a nitro group to acetanilide would likely reduce the property value further, similar to how nitro reduces values in other examples.

### Predicted Property:
Given the combination of acetamide (moderately reducing) and nitro (strongly reducing), the property value should be **negative** and between the values of nitrobenzene (**0.163**) and methoxy-nitrobenzene (**-0.310**). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.25** (similar to COc1ccc(C=O)cc1, which is **-0.257**).

### Final Answer:
**-0.25** (approximate).

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 12.452308318542027
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S)(OCC)SC)**: This is a relatively polar and bulky functional group. Similar phosphorus-containing groups are not present in the examples, but polar groups like esters and amides tend to increase the property value (e.g., **CCCC(=O)OC** has 0.29661486, **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** has 2.08375699).
2. **Aromatic Heterocycle (n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12)**: This is a fused aromatic system with a lactam (C=O) and a chlorine substituent. Chlorinated aromatics in the examples (e.g., **Clc1cccc2ccccc12** has -0.72399264, **Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1** has -0.55987804) tend to decrease the property value, but the presence of the polar lactam (C=O) may offset this.
3. **Ethoxy Groups (OCC)**: These are moderately polar and appear in molecules like **CCCO** (1.47580966) and **CCCC(C)O** (0.2151758), suggesting they can contribute positively to the property value.
4. **Sulfur Atoms (S)**: Thioether (S) and thiophosphate (P=S) groups are present. Sulfur-containing molecules in the examples (e.g., **CSSC** has -0.73660748, **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** has 2.08375699) show a wide range, but the polar environment here may increase the value.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule combines polar (P=O, C=O), moderately polar (OCC), and hydrophobic (aromatic, Cl) features. 
- Similar complexity is seen in **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (2.08375699), which has polar amides, sulfur, and aromatics.
- The chlorine substituent may slightly lower the value compared to purely polar molecules, but the overall polarity dominates.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of polar and moderately polar groups, the predicted property value is likely in the range of **1.0 to 2.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 1.45** (specific value interpolated from similar examples). 

This accounts for the polar contributions from P=O, C=O, and OCC, offset slightly by the chlorine and aromatic systems.

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.5430147538069194
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - **CCCCCCC(C)O**: -0.73687274  
   - **CC(C)CO**: 0.931488  
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O**: -0.72765843  
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**: -0.58341103  
   - **CCCC(O)CCC**: -0.58674077  

   Alcohols generally have negative property values, but **CC(C)CO** is an exception with a positive value (0.931488). This suggests that **tertiary alcohols (like CC(C)(C)CO)** may have higher property values than primary or secondary alcohols.

2. **Branching Effects**:
   - **CC(C)CO** (secondary alcohol): 0.931488  
   - **CCCCCCC(C)O** (primary alcohol with branching): -0.73687274  
   - **CC(C)(C)CO** (tertiary alcohol) would likely have a higher value than **CC(C)CO** due to increased branching.

3. **Similar Structures**:
   - **CCC**: 1.65786868 (high value for a simple alkane)  
   - **CC=CC=O**: 1.54772561 (unsaturated aldehyde, high value)  
   - **CC(C)CO**: 0.931488 (branched alcohol, positive value)  

   Tertiary alcohols like **CC(C)(C)CO** are more sterically hindered and less polar than primary/secondary alcohols, which may push the property value higher.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **CC(C)CO** (less branched) has a value of **0.931488**,  
- **CCC** (no OH) has a value of **1.65786868**,  
- **CC(C)(C)CO** is more branched than **CC(C)CO** but still has an OH group,  

The property value for **CC(C)(C)CO** is likely **higher than 0.931488 but lower than 1.65786868**. A reasonable estimate would be around **1.2 to 1.4**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CC(C)(C)CO: 1.25** (approximate, based on trends in the data).  

*(Note: Without a clear mathematical model or additional data, this is an educated estimate based on structural similarities and trends in the given examples.)*

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -0.07739021013171486
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Heterocyclic Core**: The molecule is a fused bicyclic system with two nitrogen-containing rings (imidazole and pyrimidine-like). It resembles purine-like structures but with additional carbonyl (C=O) and NH groups.
2. **Polar Functional Groups**: 
   - Carbonyl (C=O) group: Likely increases polarity and may contribute to hydrogen bonding.
   - Multiple NH groups: Can participate in hydrogen bonding, increasing solubility or interaction potential.
3. **Aromaticity**: The rings are aromatic, which typically contributes to stability and may influence the property (e.g., lipophilicity or electronic effects).

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (property = 0.49770616): This is a similar heterocycle with C=O, NH, and aromaticity. The property is positive and moderate.
- **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1** (property = 0.63079899): Another nitrogen-rich heterocycle with C=O and NH, yielding a higher positive value.
- **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property = -0.53121605): A less polar heterocycle with no NH groups, giving a negative value.

### Key Observations:
1. Nitrogen-rich heterocycles with C=O and NH groups tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., 0.497 to 0.630).
2. The given molecule has **more NH groups and a similar C=O**, suggesting it may have a higher positive value than the examples above due to increased hydrogen bonding capacity.
3. No bulky hydrophobic groups are present to offset the polarity.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (0.497) and **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1** (0.630), but with additional NH groups, the property should be **higher than 0.630**. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **0.7 to 0.9**.

For specificity, we predict:  
**0.75**

### Rationale:
- The extra NH group in the fused ring system likely increases the property further compared to the simpler examples.
- No conflicting hydrophobic groups are present to reduce the value. 

Thus, the predicted property for **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** is **0.75**.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.9563030303469079
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Esters (e.g., CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC, -0.51703172)**: Tend to have moderately negative property values.
   - **Alcohols (e.g., CCCC(C)O, -0.56872035; CC(C)O, 1.66010451)**: Property values vary widely, but simple alcohols like isopropanol (CC(C)O) have positive values, while longer-chain alcohols are negative.
   - **Ketones (e.g., CCC(C)C(=O)C, -0.02230713)**: Tend to have near-zero or slightly negative values.
   - **Ethers (e.g., CCOC(C)C, -0.1993876)**: Tend to have slightly negative values.
   - **Acids or aldehydes (e.g., COc1ccc(C=O)cc1, -0.25700941)**: Aldehydes tend to have slightly negative values.

2. **Methyl Acetate (CC(C)OC=O)**:
   - This is an ester (R-COO-R'), similar to CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC (which is a phosphate ester with a property value of -0.51703172).
   - Methyl acetate is simpler and smaller, so its property value might be less negative than larger or more complex esters.
   - The presence of the carbonyl (C=O) and ether (O) groups suggests a value in the moderately negative range.

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCOC(C)C (ether)**: -0.1993876
   - **CCC(C)C(=O)C (ketone)**: -0.02230713
   - **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1 (aldehyde)**: -0.25700941
   - Esters tend to be more negative than ethers or ketones but less negative than long-chain alcohols.

### Prediction:
Given that methyl acetate is a small ester, its property value is likely in the range of **-0.3 to -0.6**. A reasonable estimate, considering the examples, would be around **-0.4**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is **-0.42**.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Group**: The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl rings attached to the nitrogen atoms (i.e., **N,N'-diphenylurea**). Urea derivatives in the dataset tend to have moderately negative property values (e.g., `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` has a value of `-0.75682223`).
2. **Aromatic Rings**: The presence of two phenyl rings (like in `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` with `-0.70762836`) suggests a contribution toward negative values.
3. **Polarity**: The urea group is polar, but the lack of strongly electron-withdrawing or donating substituents (e.g., no halogens or nitro groups) suggests the value won't be extreme.
4. **Comparable Molecules**:
   - `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` (a carbamate with aromatic rings): `-0.75758`
   - `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (cyclic urea): `-0.75682223`
   - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (amide with aromatic ring): `0.15937794` (less negative due to fewer aromatic rings).

### Prediction:
Given the **diphenylurea structure**, the property value is likely similar to other urea/amide derivatives with aromatic rings, falling in the moderately negative range. The absence of strongly polarizing groups (e.g., halogens, nitro) prevents extreme values, but the two phenyl rings push it toward more negative than simple amides.

**Predicted Property Value**: `-0.72` (approximate, likely between `-0.70` and `-0.75` based on comparable examples).  
**Final Answer**: `-0.72` (specific value chosen based on closest analogs).

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -0.7301962634004132
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (which is fluorene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with three fused rings: two benzene rings fused to a central cyclopentadiene ring), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple aromatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have property values close to zero, often slightly negative or positive. For example:
   - `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a value of **0.36805973**.
   - `Sc1ccccc1` (thiophene derivative) has a value of **0.07891843**.
   - `Brc1ccccc1` (bromobenzene) has a value of **-0.20470451**.

2. **Fused polycyclic aromatics** (e.g., naphthalene, anthracene-like structures) tend to have slightly higher positive values than simple benzenes, likely due to increased conjugation and molecular rigidity. For example:
   - The molecule `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (a larger fused system) has a value of **0.36805973**.

3. **Fluorene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13)** is structurally similar to these fused systems but has a slightly less conjugated central ring (cyclopentadiene) compared to a fully aromatic system like naphthalene. This might reduce the property value slightly compared to fully fused aromatics.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Naphthalene-like systems have values around **0.36**,
- Simple benzenes are closer to zero,
- Fluorene is intermediate in conjugation (less than naphthalene but more than benzene),

the predicted property value for fluorene would likely be **slightly lower than naphthalene-like systems but still positive**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**0.25** (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity, though the examples show higher precision).

### Exact Prediction:
Based on the examples and trends, the predicted property value for **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** is:  
**0.248**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on structural similarity and trends in the data. If the property is something like logP or polarizability, the reasoning would align well.) 

However, looking back at the examples, the closest structurally similar molecule is `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (0.368), and fluorene is smaller, so a value slightly lower than this is plausible. 

Thus, the final predicted value is:  
**0.248**. 

(If higher precision is needed, it could be **0.24835921**, but this is speculative.) 

For consistency with the given examples, I'll predict:  
**0.248**. 

(But since the examples have longer decimal precision, extrapolating further: **0.24835921**.) 

However, given the variability in the data, a more conservative estimate is **0.25**. 

### Final Answer:
**0.24835921** (matching the precision style of the examples). 

But given the uncertainty, the most likely value is:  
**0.25**. 

For exactness, I'll stick with:  
**0.24835921**. 

(Note: This is an extrapolation; the true value would require knowing the exact property or more data.)

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -0.5460072854647684
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **NC(=N)N**: A guanidine-like group (highly polar, basic).
   - **S(=O)(=O)**: A sulfonyl group (polar, electron-withdrawing).
   - **Aromatic ring with -NH2**: An electron-donating amino group on the phenyl ring.

2. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is polar due to the sulfonyl and amino groups but lacks long aliphatic chains or large hydrophobic regions.
   - It is smaller than most of the high-value examples (e.g., **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC** with a value of 8.758) but larger than simple halogenated or small aliphatic molecules.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with sulfonyl groups (e.g., **CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O**) have values around **1.35**.
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12**) have negative values (~**-0.45**).
   - The presence of multiple polar groups (guanidine + sulfonyl + amino) suggests moderate polarity but not extreme hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity.

4. **Trends**:
   - Large hydrophobic molecules (e.g., long alkanes) have high positive values.
   - Small/polar molecules (e.g., halogenated or heterocyclic) tend to have negative or near-zero values.
   - This molecule is intermediate in size and polarity.

### Prediction:
Given the balance of polar groups and moderate size, the property value is likely **between 0.5 and 1.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 0.72**  

This aligns with similar sulfonyl-containing polar molecules in the examples (e.g., **0.808** for **CC(C)(C)C(=O)C(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)n2cncn2**). The exact value may vary, but **0.72** is a plausible prediction based on the given data.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.6195527452730527
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**

### Key structural features:
1. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**: There are two nitro groups attached to the aromatic ring. From the examples, nitro groups tend to increase the property value (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a value of `0.02727993`, and `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` has a value of `1.18045518`).
2. **Trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)**: This is a strongly electron-withdrawing group. In the examples, halogenated aromatic rings (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl`) tend to have moderately negative values, but the presence of nitro groups may counteract this.
3. **Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C))**: This is a branched aliphatic amine attached to the aromatic ring. Amines in the examples (e.g., `CCN(CC)c1ccccc1`) have negative values, but the nitro groups likely dominate here.
4. **Aromatic ring with substitutions**: The ring is heavily substituted with nitro and trifluoromethyl groups, which are polar and likely increase the property value compared to simple aromatic systems (e.g., `c1ccccc1O` has `0.58775623`).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The molecule `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` has a nitro group and a complex structure, yielding `1.18045518`.
- The molecule `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has one nitro group and a hydroxyl, yielding `0.02727993`.
- The molecule `CCC(=C(CC)c1ccc(O)cc1)c2ccc(O)cc2` has two aromatic rings with polar groups, yielding `1.40400104`.

Given the two nitro groups and the trifluoromethyl group, the property value is likely higher than most simple aromatic systems but not as high as large steroid-like molecules (e.g., `CC(=O)OCC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3C(O)CC21C` with `12.126954`). 

### Predicted value:
Considering the strong electron-withdrawing effects and the presence of two nitro groups, the property value is likely in the range of **1.0 to 1.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.25** (specific value could be refined with more data, but this is a plausible estimate based on the given examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend that polar/electron-withdrawing groups and aromatic systems with multiple substitutions tend to increase the property value in the given examples.)

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.9563030303469079
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the given data:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Esters (RCOOR')**: Generally have negative property values (e.g., `COC(=O)c1cccnc1` has -0.14958567, `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` has -0.69149933).
   - **Aldehydes (RCHO)**: The molecule `CCCC=O` (butyraldehyde) has a high positive value (0.97175145), but this seems unusual compared to other aldehydes/ketones (e.g., `O=C1CCCCC1` has -0.21980143). This suggests aldehydes may vary widely.
   - **Ethers (ROR')**: Tend to have negative values (e.g., `CCCCCCCCO` has -0.74885958, `CC(C)CCOC=O` has -0.14625013).
   - **Branched vs. Linear**: Branched molecules often have slightly higher (less negative) values than linear ones (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)O` has 0.40381151 vs. `CCCCCC(C)O` has -0.56872035).

2. **Specific Similar Molecules**:
   - `CC(C)CCOC=O` (similar to the target but with an extra carbon) has a property value of **-0.14625013**.
   - `CC(=O)N` (acetamide) has a very high value (2.42767588), but this is likely due to the amide group, which is not present here.
   - `CCOC(=O)C` (ethyl acetate) is not directly in the list, but esters like it tend to have negative values.

3. **Target Molecule: CC(C)OC=O** (isopropyl formate):
   - This is an ester with a branched alkyl group (isopropyl) and a formate (HCOO-) group.
   - Compared to `CC(C)CCOC=O` (which is not an ester but an ether-aldehyde), the ester group here might slightly lower the property value.
   - The branching (isopropyl) may offset this slightly, leading to a value closer to -0.1 to -0.3.

### Prediction:
Given the trends, the property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is likely in the range of **-0.2 to -0.4**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.25** (similar to `O=C1CCCCC1` but slightly more negative due to the ester nature). 

However, considering the similarity to `CC(C)CCOC=O` (-0.14625013) and adjusting for the formate group (which may lower it further), a more precise guess is:

**Final predicted value: -0.18** (between -0.15 and -0.20). 

But to align better with the ester trend, I'll refine to **-0.22**. 

### Final Answer:
**-0.22**

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.2550902513456276
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **3-methylphenol** (meta-cresol with an OH group), with the SMILES representation:  
**Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**  
- It contains a benzene ring with two substituents:  
  - A methyl group (**-CH3**) at position 1.  
  - Another methyl group at position 3.  
  - A hydroxyl group (**-OH**) at position 5.  

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Simple Aromatic Systems with Polar Groups**:  
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol): Property value = **0.58775623**  
     (Phenol has an -OH group, contributing positively to the property.)  
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde): Property value = **0.23239767**  
     (Carbonyl group adds some polarity but less than -OH.)  
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1** (xylene-like): No direct example, but simpler aromatics with alkyl groups tend to have values closer to zero or slightly negative.  

2. **Methyl Substitution Effects**:  
   - **Cc1ccccc1C** (toluene derivative): Property value = **-0.53700496**  
     (Methyl groups slightly reduce the property compared to phenol.)  
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1** (xylene): No exact example, but likely similar or slightly more negative than toluene.  

3. **Hydroxyl Group Contribution**:  
   - The -OH group tends to increase the property (as seen in phenol's positive value).  
   - In **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, the -OH is competing with two methyl groups, which may dampen its effect.  

4. **Combined Substituent Effects**:  
   - The two methyl groups likely pull the property toward negative values (like toluene or xylene).  
   - The -OH group pulls it toward positive values (like phenol).  
   - The net effect is likely a balance, leaning slightly negative due to the two methyl groups.  

### Closest Analogues:
- **Phenol (c1ccccc1O)**: **0.58775623**  
- **Toluene (Cc1ccccc1)**: No exact example, but **Cc1ccccc1C** is **-0.53700496**.  
- **Xylene-like (two methyl groups)**: Likely closer to **-0.5 to -0.3**.  
- Adding -OH to xylene would partially offset the methyl effect, bringing it closer to zero.  

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the competing effects of the two methyl groups (-0.5 to -0.3) and the -OH group (+0.5 to +0.6), the net value is likely slightly negative but closer to zero.  

**Predicted Property Value: ~ -0.2 to 0.0**  
A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.15**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on interpolating trends from the given examples. If the property is something like logP or solubility, the reasoning aligns with the observed data.)  

---  
**Final Answer:**  
**-0.15** (approximate, based on structural analogues).  

(For higher precision, more examples or the specific property name would be needed.)

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 4.293153664846036
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P=S) Groups**: 
   - Molecules with **COP(=S)(OC)O** fragments tend to have higher property values, especially when combined with aromatic rings and halogen substitutions. Examples:
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl` → **3.57237303**
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl` → **4.24699711**
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` → **2.67931501**
     - `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` → **17.46382783** (very high due to additional bulky groups).

2. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens) tend to decrease the property value slightly (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` → **-0.56283647**).
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., methyl, methoxy) tend to increase the property value modestly (e.g., `Cc1ccc(O)cc1C` → **-0.2597527**).

3. **Thioether (S-C) Group**:
   - The presence of **SC** (thioether) in the aromatic ring is not directly represented in the examples, but sulfur-containing groups (like **P=S**) are associated with higher values. Thioethers may contribute similarly.

4. **Hybrid Structure**:
   - The target molecule combines:
     - A **COP(=S)(OC)O** group (high-value contributor).
     - An aromatic ring with **SC** (thioether) and **C** (methyl) substituents (moderate influence).

### Comparison to Closest Examples:
- The closest analog is `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (property = **2.67931501**), where halogens are replaced with **SC** and **C** in the target molecule. 
- Thioether (**SC**) is less electron-withdrawing than halogens, so the property value may be slightly higher than the chloro analog but lower than the iodo/bromo analogs (which have values ~3.5–4.2). 
- The methyl group (**C**) is weakly electron-donating, which may further increase the value slightly.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** is likely in the range of **3.0 to 3.8**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 3.4** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends). 

### Note:
Without a clear quantitative model or more examples of thioether-containing phosphorothioates, this prediction is qualitative. The actual value could vary slightly depending on subtle electronic or steric effects.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.7031074637517256
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic systems** tend to have **moderate to high positive property values**:
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** → **1.41333947**
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** → **2.27453709**

2. The molecule in question is **even more heavily chlorinated** than the above examples, with **7 chlorine atoms** and a fused biphenyl-like structure. This suggests an **even higher property value** due to increased halogen density and molecular complexity.

3. The presence of **fused aromatic rings with multiple chlorines** (like in the given examples) consistently elevates the property value compared to simpler chlorinated aromatics.

### Prediction:
Given the trend, the property value for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** should be **higher than 2.27453709** (the most similar example) but likely not exceeding **~3.0**, as the increase is not linear with additional chlorines. 

#### Predicted value: **~2.6**  
(Exact prediction: **2.58**, interpolating between the closest examples.)

### Reasoning:
- The molecule is structurally similar to **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (value = 2.27453709) but with slightly fewer chlorines on one ring (replacing a **C-Cl** with **C-H**). However, the fused system and symmetry may compensate, placing it close to this benchmark.  
- If forced to pick a specific number: **2.58**.  

Let me know if you'd like further justification!

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.9182663780210901
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro Group (NO2)**: 
   - The presence of a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) tends to decrease the property value, especially when attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` has a value of -0.103, while `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` has -0.591). 
   - However, when the nitro group is attached to an aliphatic chain (e.g., `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O`), the effect is less pronounced (value = 1.337), but this molecule also has other complex features (aromatic rings, trifluoromethyl groups).

2. **Aliphatic Chains**:
   - Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCC` = 1.657, `CC` = 2.413) tend to have higher property values unless polar or functionalized groups are present.
   - When polar groups (e.g., `C=O`, `OH`, `NO2`) are added, the property value decreases (e.g., `CCCCCC=O` = -0.170, `CCCCCCCCO` = -0.748).

3. **CCCN(=O)=O**:
   - This is a short aliphatic chain (`CCC`) with a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) at the end.
   - The nitro group is likely to reduce the property value compared to pure aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCC` = 1.657), but not as drastically as in aromatic nitro compounds.
   - Similar aliphatic nitro examples are not present in the given data, but we can interpolate:
     - `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` has a value of 1.337, but this is a much larger and more complex molecule.
     - Simpler nitroalkanes like `CCCN(=O)=O` should have a lower value than `CCC` but not extremely negative.

### Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **CCCN(=O)=O** is likely in the range of **0.5 to 1.0**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: 0.75**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.28333222990935986
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends based on substituents and molecular features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogen-Substituted Aromatic Rings**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: Property = -0.52764519  
     (Chlorine and Bromine on benzene)
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: Property = 0.12626767  
     (Multiple chlorines on two benzene rings)
   - **BrC(Br)Br**: Property = -0.54409901  
     (Bromine substituents on a non-aromatic carbon)
   - **COc1ccccc1Cl**: Property = -0.29415702  
     (Chlorine and methoxy on benzene)
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c1**: Not directly given, but similar to the above.

2. **Fluorine-Substituted Aromatics**:
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1**: Property = -0.43725275  
     (Fluorine on benzene with an amide group)
   - No direct example of **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, but we can interpolate.

3. **Bromine-Substituted Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: Property = -0.52764519  
     (Chlorine and Bromine on benzene)
   - **c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12**: Property = -0.76588043  
     (Bromine on a naphthalene ring)

### Analysis for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**:
- The molecule is a benzene ring with **Fluorine (F)** and **Bromine (Br)** substituents.
- Comparing to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (property = -0.52764519), where Cl and Br are present, replacing Cl with F (which is slightly less electronegative than Cl but still electron-withdrawing) might slightly increase the property value (make it less negative).
- Fluorine is smaller and less polarizable than chlorine, so its effect on the property might be slightly weaker than chlorine's.
- The position of substituents (meta in this case) also matters, but the examples don't provide enough positional data to refine further.

### Estimated Property:
Given the similarity to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (-0.52764519) and adjusting for fluorine being slightly less electron-withdrawing than chlorine, the property for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** would likely be slightly higher (less negative). 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.45** (rounded from an estimated range of -0.47 to -0.43).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is approximately **-0.45**.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a bicyclic system (decane-like framework) with two fused rings (one cyclohexane and one cyclopentane). It has a tertiary alcohol group (`C(O)`), two quaternary carbons (`C(C)(C)`), and no highly polar or charged functional groups.
2. **Similar Examples**:
   - **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2**: Property = 6.34456011 (complex, but has aromatic rings and ester groups, which are absent here).
   - **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**: Property = 13.54358019 (steroid-like, highly oxidized).
   - **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**: Property = 9.54325454 (similar bicyclic but more oxidized).
   - **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: Property = 8.18271316 (bicyclic with ketone and alcohol).

### Key Observations:
- The molecule lacks aromaticity, halogens, or highly polar groups (e.g., nitro, sulfonyl).
- It has a simple alcohol and aliphatic character, similar to **CC(C)(C)CO** (property = 0.54301475) but more rigid due to the bicyclic structure.
- Bicyclic alkanes with minimal functionalization (e.g., **CC1CCCO1**, property = 0.15228427) tend to have low-moderate positive values.

### Prediction:
Given the absence of strong electron-withdrawing/donating groups and the neutral/aliphatic nature, the property is likely in the **low-positive range**, similar to simpler alicyclic alcohols. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.85**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural analogies. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 4.619891235509668
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, halogens, and polar groups. The molecule in question is:

**CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**

This molecule shares significant structural similarity with the last example in the provided list:

**CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O**, which has a property value of **15.87138525**.

### Key similarities:
1. Both contain the **P(=S)(OCC)** group (a thiophosphate ester).
2. Both have a **N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** moiety (a phthalimide-like structure).
3. The main difference is the replacement of **SC(CCl)** in the last example with **N2C(=O)** in the new molecule. This substitution slightly reduces the complexity and halogen presence but retains the core structural features.

### Differences:
- The new molecule lacks the **SC(CCl)** group, which likely contributed to the very high property value in the last example (due to sulfur and chlorine). 
- However, the **P(=S)** and phthalimide-like structure are still present, which are strong contributors to the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the high property value of the similar molecule (15.87138525) and the slightly reduced complexity (no sulfur or chlorine in the side chain), the predicted property value for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** would still be very high but slightly lower. 

**Predicted property value: ~14.5** (e.g., 14.5 to 15.0 range). 

For specificity, I would estimate:  
**14.721**. 

This accounts for the retained high-impact features (P(=S), phthalimide) while slightly reducing the value due to the absence of the **SC(CCl)** group.

**Final answer: 14.721**

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -0.7481811885574007
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Presence of aromatic rings (e.g., benzene or heterocycles)**:
   - Aromatic rings alone (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) tend to have property values around **-0.5 to -0.7** (e.g., `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` = -0.59201182).
   - Fused aromatic systems (e.g., `C1Cc2c3c1cccc3cc4c2ccc5ccccc54`) have higher values (~1.92306839), likely due to increased conjugation.

2. **Carbonyl groups (C=O)**:
   - Carbonyl groups in aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCC(=O)C`) can increase the property value (1.09822903).
   - Carbonyls in aromatic or heterocyclic systems (e.g., `O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`) tend to have values around **-0.7 to -0.4**.

3. **Nitrogen-containing heterocycles**:
   - Pyridine-like nitrogens (e.g., `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2`) have values around **-0.4 to -0.5**.
   - Amide nitrogens (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C`) increase the value slightly (0.22680365).

4. **Substituents**:
   - Methyl groups (`C` or `Cc`) tend to slightly lower the value (e.g., `Cc1cccc(C)c1C` = -0.4555042).
   - Oxygen substituents (e.g., `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) lower the value (-0.6260752).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** has:
- A **fused heterocyclic system** with two nitrogens and a carbonyl (C=O).
- A **benzene ring attached to one nitrogen**.
- Two **methyl groups** (`C` at the start and end).

#### Similar Examples:
- `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (similar heterocycle, no carbonyl): **-0.46793559**.
- `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC` (carbonyl + nitrogens): **-0.18968932**.
- `c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32` (fused aromatic + nitrogen): **-0.76033284**.

Given the presence of the **carbonyl in the heterocycle** and the **fused aromatic system**, the value is likely between **-0.4 and -0.7**. The methyl groups may slightly lower it further.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.55** (approximate, based on similar structures). 

For higher precision, the closest analog is `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (-0.46793559), but with the added carbonyl, the value might decrease slightly. Thus, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: -0.50** (rounded to match the trend). 

However, considering the fused aromatic system and carbonyl, a more accurate prediction would be closer to **-0.45 to -0.55**. 

**Final answer: -0.48** (balancing the effects of the carbonyl and aromatic system). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends.)

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.739395516926173
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate), I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Key Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Carbon Chain Length and Saturation**: 
   - Longer carbon chains (e.g., **CCCCC**, property = 0.255) tend to have small positive values unless functional groups significantly alter the property.
   - Unsaturated or branched chains (e.g., **CCC(=C)C**, property = 0.881) can have higher values.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Esters (RCOOR')**: 
     - **CCOC(=O)N** (ethyl carbamate) has a high value (1.207), but this includes an amide-like nitrogen.
     - **CC(C)OC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate) has a moderate value (0.386).
   - **Carboxylic Acids/Esters**: 
     - The presence of **C(=O)O** (ester or acid) tends to give moderate values unless other polar groups dominate.

3. **Polarity and Halogens**:
   - Highly polar or halogenated molecules (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl**, property = 1.413) have very high values.
   - Simple esters without halogens or additional polar groups (like **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**) are less extreme.

4. **Similar Examples**:
   - **CC(C)OC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate, 0.386) is structurally similar (ester with short alkyl chains).
   - **CCCC** (butane, not in the list but simpler chains suggest small positive values).

### Prediction for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is a **6-carbon ester (ethyl hexanoate)** with no additional polar groups or halogens.
- The hexyl chain is longer than in **CC(C)OC(=O)C**, but the ester group is similar.
- Longer chains may slightly reduce the property value compared to shorter esters (due to reduced polarity contribution per atom).
- No strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups are present.

Given these observations, the property value is likely **moderate and positive**, similar to other simple esters but slightly lower due to the longer alkyl chain.

### Estimated Property Value:
**0.35** (approximate, based on comparison to similar molecules like **CC(C)OC(=O)C** (0.386) and adjusting for chain length). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.2717624404765136
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural and functional group trends that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Esters**: 
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate) has a property value of **-0.67080612**.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) has a property value of **-0.62011013**.
   - Both are aromatic esters with similar structures, and their property values are negative and close to each other.

2. **Methyl vs. Ethyl Esters**:
   - The given molecule is **methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1)**, which is structurally similar to ethyl benzoate but with a shorter alkyl chain (methyl instead of ethyl).
   - Shorter alkyl chains (methyl) tend to slightly increase the property value compared to longer chains (ethyl), as seen in other examples (e.g., **CCC(=O)CC** vs. **CC(C)OC(=O)C**).

3. **Substituent Effects**:
   - The absence of an electron-donating or withdrawing group (like -OH in ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate) suggests the property value for methyl benzoate should be slightly higher (less negative) than ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate (-0.67080612) but close to ethyl benzoate (-0.62011013).

4. **Trend for Simple Aromatic Esters**:
   - Simple aromatic esters without additional functional groups tend to cluster around **-0.6 to -0.7** in the given data.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to ethyl benzoate (-0.62011013) and the slightly less negative effect of the methyl group (compared to ethyl), the predicted property value for **methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1)** is approximately:

**-0.61**

### Final Answer:
**-0.61** (estimated based on structural analogs in the dataset).

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 1.3000124417550323
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons with Conjugation or Unsaturation**:
   - **C=C** (e.g., `C/C=C/C` (trans-2-butene)) has a property value of **0.72886708**.
   - **Aromatic rings** (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34` (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon)) has a value of **-0.2611761**.
   - **C=CCC=C** is a conjugated diene, which is more unsaturated than a simple alkene but less aromatic than a benzene ring.

2. **Saturated Hydrocarbons**:
   - `CCCCCCC(=O)OCC` (an ester with a long alkyl chain) has a value of **-0.75423707**.
   - `CCC(C)(C)CC` (a branched alkane) has a value of **-0.37629351**.
   - `C1CCCC1` (cyclopentane) has a value of **0.16275916**.

3. **Polar or Functionalized Molecules**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., Cl, Br, O, N) tend to have more extreme values (either higher or lower depending on the group).
   - Simple hydrocarbons without functional groups typically have values closer to zero.

### Prediction for C=CCC=C:
- **C=CCC=C** is a conjugated diene, which is more unsaturated than `C/C=C/C` (property = 0.72886708) but lacks aromatic stabilization.
- Conjugation typically increases polarity and reactivity compared to isolated double bonds, but not as much as aromaticity.
- The value for `C=CCC=C` should be slightly lower than `C/C=C/C` due to increased conjugation but higher than saturated or non-conjugated hydrocarbons.

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for **C=CCC=C** is:
**0.45** (between the value of `C/C=C/C` and simpler alkanes/cycloalkanes).

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for C=CCC=C: 0.45**

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: -0.5440990104460732
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - **Brominated Aromatics**: 
     - `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (dibromonaphthalene-like): **-0.76588043**
     - `Ic1cccc2ccccc12` (iodinated aromatic): **-0.73475017**
     - `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (chlorinated aromatic): **-0.72263899**
   - **Highly Chlorinated Aliphatics**:
     - `COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (chlorinated phosphate): **-0.32385856**
     - `Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (hexachlorobiphenyl-like): **0.70310746**
   - **Brominated Aliphatics**:
     - `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` (bromochlorotrifluoroethane): **0.01715266**

2. **Simple Halomethanes**:
   - No direct examples of simple trihalomethanes (like CHBr₃) are given, but we can infer from similar compounds:
     - The presence of multiple halogens (especially bromine) tends to lower the property value (more negative) unless the molecule is highly polarizable or has other functional groups (e.g., `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` is slightly positive).

3. **Electronegativity and Size**:
   - Bromine is less electronegative than chlorine but larger and more polarizable. In `BrC(Br)Br`, the three bromines create a heavy, polarizable molecule with no aromatic stabilization or other functional groups to offset the halogen effect.

### Prediction for BrC(Br)Br:
- The molecule is analogous to chloroform (CHCl₃) but with bromines. From the examples:
  - Chlorinated aromatics are more negative than brominated ones (compare `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` at **-0.72263899** vs. `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1` at **-0.76588043**).
  - The aliphatic `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` is slightly positive (**0.01715266**), but this has fluorine (which is highly electronegative) and only one bromine.
  - `BrC(Br)Br` lacks aromaticity or other functional groups, so it will likely have a moderately negative value, similar to other brominated aliphatics but more negative than the fluorinated example.

Given these trends, a reasonable prediction for **BrC(Br)Br** is:  
**-0.45** (approximately midway between the highly negative brominated aromatic and the slightly positive fluorinated/brominated aliphatic).

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at the range:
- Highly brominated/chlorinated aliphatics with no other functional groups tend to cluster around **-0.3 to -0.7**.
- `BrC(Br)Br` is simpler and more symmetric than most examples, so it may be less negative than the brominated aromatic but more negative than the mixed halogen example.

Final predicted value:  
**-0.55** (closer to the brominated aromatic but adjusted for aliphatic nature). 

However, given the example of `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` (which is mixed halogen and slightly positive), and the lack of other simple trihalomethanes, a more conservative estimate might be closer to **-0.35**. 

Given the uncertainty, I would predict:  
**-0.40** (balancing the bromine effects and lack of other functional groups). 

But reviewing again, the brominated aromatic is at **-0.765**, and the aliphatic `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` is at **0.017**, so a simple trihalomethane like `BrC(Br)Br` might be around **-0.30 to -0.50**. 

Final answer:  
**-0.42** (a compromise between the observed trends). 

However, the closest analog is `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` (mixed halogen, slightly positive), and `BrC(Br)Br` is fully brominated, so likely more negative. 

After careful consideration, the predicted property value for **BrC(Br)Br** is:  
**-0.38**

Iteration: 39
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 15.871385254903375
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: 
   - The molecule **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a value of **12.25540834**. This suggests that the presence of a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)) tends to contribute significantly to the property, especially when combined with aromatic rings and halogens (Cl in this case).

2. **Aromatic Rings (c1ccccc1)**:
   - Aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) often contribute negatively to the property when unsubstituted (e.g., **c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2** has **-0.72023745**), but substitutions can modulate this.

3. **Chlorine (Cl)**:
   - Chlorine substitutions tend to reduce the property (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** has **-0.73252503**), but this depends on the context (e.g., in **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl**, the value is **0.14412419**).

4. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - Carbonyl groups in amides or lactams (e.g., **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**) tend to reduce the property (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccccc1** has **-0.68188256**).

5. **Ethoxy Groups (OCC)**:
   - Ethoxy groups (OCC) are present in some molecules but don't seem to dominate the property unless combined with other features.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** has:
- A **phosphorothioate group (P(=S))** with two ethoxy (OCC) groups and a thiolate (SC) linkage.
- A **chlorine-substituted carbon (C(CCl))** attached to the thiolate.
- A **lactam (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)** with a fused benzene ring.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
1. The phosphorothioate group is similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (value: **12.25540834**), but our molecule has:
   - A lactam instead of an amide.
   - A chlorine substitution on the carbon adjacent to the thiolate.
   - No additional aromatic substitution beyond the fused benzene in the lactam.

2. The lactam (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O) is similar to **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccccc1** (value: **-0.68188256**), but our molecule has a more complex fused system.

### Balancing Contributions:
- The phosphorothioate group would push the value higher (toward ~12).
- The lactam and chlorine would reduce the value (negative contributions).
- The ethoxy groups are neutral to slightly positive.

Given these competing effects, the property is likely **lower** than **12.25540834** but still **positive** due to the phosphorothioate dominance. 

### Predicted Value:
Considering the structural similarities and trade-offs, a reasonable estimate is:  
**6.5** (with uncertainty in the range of 5–8). 

However, looking more closely at the examples, the phosphorothioate group's influence is strong, and the other features don't fully counteract it. A more precise estimate is:  
**7.8**. 

But to match the style of the given examples (which often have more decimal places), I'll refine it further to:  
**7.523941**. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is:  
**7.523941**.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 2.093790245193571
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and the presence of polar or bulky substituents. 

The molecule in question is:  
**CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**  

### Key structural features:  
1. **Aromatic ring with chlorine substitution** (Cl on benzene ring) – tends to decrease the property value (e.g., Cl-substituted aromatics in the examples have negative or low values).  
2. **Urea-like fragment (N-C(=O)-N)** – moderately polar but not strongly influential (similar to amides/ureas in the examples, which have values around -0.5 to 0.2).  
3. **Bulky tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)** – increases the property value (e.g., bulky groups like C(C)(C)CO in one example gave 8.037).  
4. **Heterocyclic fragment (n2nc(oc2=O))** – likely decreases the value due to polarity (similar to other N/O heterocycles in the examples with negative values).  
5. **N,N-dimethylamide (CN(C)C=O)** – moderately increases the value (e.g., CN(C)C=O in an example gave 1.013).  

### Comparison with similar molecules:  
- **Bulky + polar groups**: The molecule resembles a hybrid of bulky substituents (like C(C)(C)C) and polar fragments (like Cl-substituted aromatics and heterocycles).  
- **Examples with tert-butyl**: The presence of C(C)(C)C in other molecules correlates with higher values (e.g., 8.037 for C(C)(C)CO).  
- **Chlorine + aromatic**: Cl-substituted aromatics tend to pull the value down (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl: -0.732).  

### Prediction:  
The competing effects of the **bulky tert-butyl group (increasing value)** and the **Cl-substituted aromatic + polar heterocycle (decreasing value)** suggest a **moderate positive value**, but not as high as the purely bulky examples.  

Given the trends, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: ~2.5 to 4.0**  

A specific prediction based on weighting the influences:  
**Final predicted value: 3.25**  

*(This is an educated guess based on the examples, where bulky groups dominate polarity effects in raising the value.)*

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: -0.05454303557126626
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Polar Functional Groups (e.g., -OH, -NO₂, -CN, -COO, -NH₂)**:
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., hydroxyls, nitro groups, amines) tend to have higher (less negative) property values. For example:
     - `OCC(O)C(O)CO` (multiple -OH groups) has a value of **0.3868**.
     - `NC(N)=NC#N` (polar nitrile and amine groups) has a value of **1.9485**.
     - `CCC=O` (aldehyde) has a high value of **1.7665**.

2. **Aromatic Rings and Halogens (Cl, Br, F)**:
   - Aromatic rings with halogens (especially multiple halogens) tend to have negative property values. For example:
     - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` has a value of **-0.5874**.
     - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (multiple Cl substituents) has a value of **-0.7548**.
     - `c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2` has a value of **-0.7420**.

3. **Hybrid Cases (Polar + Aromatic/Halogen)**:
   - Molecules with both polar groups and aromatic/halogen substituents tend to have intermediate values. For example:
     - `Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1` (aromatic + aldehyde) has a value of **0.0912**.
     - `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (aromatic + amine + Cl) has a value of **-0.0143**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** has:
- Two aromatic rings linked by an oxygen (ether linkage).
- Three chlorine substituents (two on one ring, one on the other).
- Two hydroxyl (-OH) groups (attached to each aromatic ring).

This is a hybrid case with both polar (-OH) and halogen (Cl) features. Comparing to similar examples:
- `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (one aromatic ring, one -OH, two Cl) has a value of **-0.3585**.
- `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (one aromatic ring, one -OH, four Cl) has a value of **-0.7548**.
- `Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1` (one aromatic ring, one -OH, one aldehyde) has a value of **0.0912**.

Given that our target molecule has two -OH groups (increasing polarity) but three Cl atoms (increasing negative contribution), the net effect is likely slightly more negative than `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` but less negative than `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`. 

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **-0.45**. This balances the polar contribution of the two -OH groups with the negative contribution of the three Cl atoms and aromatic systems.

**Final Answer: -0.45**

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.7288670784984146
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular weight, polarity, and structural features such as conjugation, branching, and functional groups. 

The molecule in question is `CC/C=C\C`, which is trans-2-pentene (a 5-carbon alkene with a trans double bond). 

From the examples:
- `CC/C=C/C` (likely cis-2-butene or a similar small alkene) has a property value of **0.72886708**.
- `CCCC` (butane) is not in the examples, but small alkanes and alkenes tend to have property values close to zero or slightly positive.
- The presence of a double bond (as in `CC/C=C/C`) seems to increase the property value compared to fully saturated analogs.

Since `CC/C=C\C` is very similar in structure to `CC/C=C/C` (both are small alkenes), but with one additional carbon, we can infer that its property value would be slightly higher due to increased molecular weight and similar polarity/conjugation effects. 

**Predicted property value for `CC/C=C\C`: ~0.75 to 0.85**. 

A reasonable estimate would be **0.80**, interpolating from the given examples. 

(Note: If the property is logP or a similar descriptor, the value aligns with trends for small, nonpolar alkenes.)

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 0.17166360687877014
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes**:
   - **C** (methane): 4.66019978 (very high)
   - **CC#C** (propyne): 2.83865538 (high, likely due to the triple bond)
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): 1.769481 (lower than propyne, but still high due to triple bond)
   - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-octene): -0.60243886 (moderately negative, double bond reduces value compared to alkanes)
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cycloheptane): -0.59183719 (cyclic alkane, moderately negative)

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): 1.66010451 (positive, hydroxyl group)
   - **CCC(O)CC** (2-pentanol): 0.17447455 (positive, but lower than isopropanol, likely due to longer chain)
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (methoxyphenol): -0.00126515 (ether + phenol, near zero)
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate): -0.62011013 (ester, negative)
   - **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate): -0.09073224 (ester, slightly negative)

3. **Ethers**:
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (methoxyphenol): -0.00126515 (aromatic ether, near zero)
   - **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether): No direct example, but ethers seem to have values near zero or slightly positive/negative depending on the structure.

4. **Other Trends**:
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, I) tend to reduce the property value (e.g., **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: -0.65416892).
   - Nitrogen-containing groups (amines, amides, nitro) vary but often give moderately negative values (e.g., **N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: -0.76523672).
   - Highly polar or complex structures (e.g., sugars, steroids) can have very high values (e.g., **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: 11.41870221).

### Prediction for CCCOCC (diethyl ether):
- Diethyl ether is a simple aliphatic ether with no halogens, nitrogens, or other highly polar groups.
- Compared to **COc1ccccc1O** (methoxyphenol, aromatic ether with a phenol group: -0.00126515), diethyl ether is simpler and lacks the aromatic ring or additional hydroxyl group.
- Ethers seem to have values near zero, and aliphatic ethers might be slightly higher than aromatic ethers due to less conjugation.
- The presence of oxygen (like in alcohols) often gives positive values, but ethers are less polar than alcohols, so the value should be lower than **CC(C)O** (1.66010451).

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for **CCCOCC** would be slightly positive but lower than alcohols, likely in the range of **0.2 to 0.5**. 

### Final Prediction:
**0.35** (specific value chosen based on interpolation between similar molecules). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. The property could be logP, solubility, or another descriptor, but the approach remains the same.)

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.9604192183135845
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a **tertiary amide** group (`N(C=O)`), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (as an acceptor).
   - It has two **phenyl rings** (one substituted with a bulky tert-butyl-like group, `C(C)(C)c1ccccc1`, and the other unsubstituted, `c2ccccc2`).
   - The **tert-butyl-like group** (`C(C)(C)`) attached to one phenyl ring adds steric bulk and hydrophobicity.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **Similar to "CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3" (property = 2.08375699)**:
     - Both have a tertiary amide (`N(C=O)`) and two phenyl rings.
     - The given example has a slightly more polar heterocyclic group (`COc1nc2ccccc2s1`), which may increase its property value slightly compared to our molecule's tert-butyl group.
   - **Similar to "CC34CC(O)C1(F)C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4(O)C(=O)CO" (property = 9.11184684)**:
     - This is much larger and more polar (multiple OH and C=O groups), so our molecule's value should be much lower.
   - **Similar to "C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2" (property = -0.59201182)**:
     - This has two phenyl rings but no polar amide, so our molecule should have a higher value due to the amide.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The **amide group** increases the property value compared to purely hydrophobic molecules (e.g., `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` with -0.59).
   - The **tert-butyl-like group** adds hydrophobicity but less than long aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCO` with 0.156).
   - The **two phenyl rings** contribute to a moderate value, similar to other aromatic amides in the examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarities to molecules with values around **2.0 to 2.4** (e.g., `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` at 2.08 and `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(N=CNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` at 2.43), and considering the balance between the polar amide and hydrophobic tert-butyl/phenyl groups, the predicted value is likely in this range. 

**Final Prediction: 2.25** (specific value chosen based on structural weighting between the examples). 

This is an estimate based on the given data and structural trends. For precise predictions, computational tools or experimental measurements would be needed.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.7465021398845683
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a substituted benzene ring (**c1ccc(Br)cc1**) with an acetamido group (**CC(=O)N-**) attached. This is similar to other aromatic systems in the dataset.
2. **Substituents**:
   - **Bromine (Br)**: Bromine is present in several examples, e.g., `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` (-0.283), `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (-0.309), and `c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1` (-0.714). Bromine tends to lower the property value, especially when multiple halogens are present.
   - **Acetamido (CC(=O)N-)**: This is a polar, hydrogen-bonding group. Similar groups like amides or carbonyls appear in molecules with moderately negative property values (e.g., `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2` at -0.765).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` has a property value of **-0.309**. Replacing the hydroxyl (-OH) with an acetamido (-NHC(=O)CH3) group would likely make the property more negative due to increased polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity.
   - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` (two chlorines) has a value of **-0.254**, while `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (multiple chlorines) has **1.423**, suggesting halogens can have complex effects but generally lower values unless heavily substituted.
   - `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` (methyl and amino groups) has **0.050**, but replacing -NH2 with -NHC(=O)CH3 would likely reduce the value further.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of a single bromine and the polar acetamido group, the property value should be moderately negative, similar to or slightly lower than `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (-0.309). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.45** (between -0.3 and -0.6, accounting for the acetamido group's additional polarity). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.45** (approximate predicted value).

Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.7091567806538382
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Benzene Derivatives**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline): **0.04460246**
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): **0.05290516**
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene): **-0.53386492**
   - **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (methylnaphthalene): **-0.70762836**
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1** (cyanobenzene): **0.2885954**
   - **Brc1ccccc1** (bromobenzene): **-0.20470451**

   Benzene derivatives with simple alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl) tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative. Larger or branched alkyl groups (e.g., isobutyl) may further decrease the value.

2. **Alkyl Group Influence**:
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol): **0.931488**
   - **CC(C)CCO** (branched alcohol): **0.29434112**
   - **CCCC(C)O** (branched alcohol): **0.2151758**
   - **CC1CCCCC1** (methylcyclohexane): **-0.54004745**

   Branched alkyl groups (e.g., isopropyl, isobutyl) tend to reduce the property value compared to linear chains, but the effect depends on the rest of the molecule.

3. **Specific Comparison**:
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene) has a value of **-0.53386492**. This is a benzene ring with an ethyl and a methyl group.
   - **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene) has a benzene ring with a larger, branched isobutyl group. The branching and size of the alkyl group would likely further decrease the property value compared to ethyltoluene.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Ethyltoluene (smaller linear alkyl group) has a value of **-0.53386492**,
- Isobutylbenzene (larger branched alkyl group) would likely have a more negative value due to increased steric bulk and hydrophobicity.

A reasonable estimate is slightly more negative than ethyltoluene, around **-0.65 to -0.75**. Looking at similar examples (e.g., **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** at **-0.70762836**), I predict:

**Predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1: -0.68**

### Final Answer:
-0.68
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.23239767492341634
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule has an aldehyde group (–CHO) attached to a benzene ring. 
   - Similar molecules with a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to an aromatic ring include:
     - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (property: -0.12081424) – This is an amide (–CONH2) with an additional hydroxyl (–OH) group.
     - **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (property: 0.11163199) – This is a more complex structure with two aromatic rings and a urea-like core.
   - The aldehyde group is more electron-withdrawing than an amide but less polar than a nitro group (–NO2), which tends to lower the property value (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has a value of -0.29279833).

2. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple benzene derivatives with moderate substituents (e.g., **COc1ccccc1**, property: 0.13863999) tend to have values close to zero.
   - The aldehyde group is more polar than a methoxy group (–OCH3), so I’d expect a slightly lower value than 0.13863999 but higher than -0.12081424 (the amide example).

3. **Comparison to Other Carbonyl-Containing Aromatics**:
   - The aldehyde is less polar than a carboxylic acid or ester (which are absent in the dataset but generally lower), but more polar than simple alkyl groups (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1** would likely have a lower value, though not provided).

### Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde) is likely **between -0.1 and 0.1**. A reasonable estimate would be close to the amide example but slightly higher due to the less polar nature of the aldehyde compared to the amide. 

**Final predicted value: ~0.05** (specific guess: **0.052**). 

However, looking at the trend more carefully, the closest analog is **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (-0.12081424), and since the aldehyde is less polar than the amide+hydroxyl but still electron-withdrawing, I’d adjust slightly upward. 

**Refined prediction: ~0.0 to -0.05**. 

Given the examples, I’ll predict:  
**Predicted property value for O=Cc1ccccc1: -0.08**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on interpolating the trend from similar structures in the dataset.)

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.7552305807489161
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**C(=O)N**), a nitro group (**N(=O)=O**), and a furan-like ring (**N=Cc1ccc(o1)**). 
   - The presence of multiple polar groups (amides, nitro) suggests moderate polarity, which may lower the property value compared to nonpolar hydrocarbons.

2. **Aromaticity and Conjugation**: 
   - The structure includes an aromatic ring (furan-like) and conjugation via the **N=C** linkage, which may stabilize the molecule but not drastically increase the property value.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups (e.g., **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2**) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -0.159).
   - Molecules with multiple amides (e.g., **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1**) also tend to have negative values (e.g., -0.495).
   - The furan-like ring (similar to **c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2**) has a slightly negative value (-0.058).

4. **Overall Trend**:
   - The combination of a nitro group, amides, and aromaticity suggests a property value in the moderately negative range, likely between **-0.4 and -0.6**.

### Predicted Value:
Given the structural similarities to molecules with negative property values and the presence of multiple polar groups, the predicted property value for **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2** is approximately:

**-0.52**  

This aligns with the trends observed in the examples, where nitro and amide functionalities reduce the property value.

Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.7380919786230009
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **0.50630201**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (a diazo compound linking two phenyl rings) has a property value of **-0.75376759**.
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to the diazo compound but replaces the N=N group with an N-N linkage (hydrazine-like). This is less conjugated and less electron-withdrawing than N=N.

2. **Effect of Nitrogen Linkage**:
   - The N-N single bond in **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is less polarizing than N=N, so we expect its property value to be less negative than **-0.75376759** but still lower than simple aniline (**0.50630201**).

3. **Comparison with Other Examples**:
   - The presence of two phenyl rings tends to reduce the property value when linked by non-conjugated or electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** at **-0.75376759**).
   - The N-N linkage is less electron-withdrawing than N=N, so we expect a value closer to **aniline** but still negative due to reduced conjugation.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** but with a less electron-withdrawing N-N group, the property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** should be **less negative** than **-0.75376759** but still negative. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

This accounts for:
- Reduced conjugation compared to N=N.
- Similarity to aniline but with an additional phenyl ring slightly lowering the value. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on trends in the given data.)

Iteration: 50
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -0.7652998119247788
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure (cyclopentane, **CCCC1**). It is a cyclic diamide (imide) with a 5-membered ring fused to another 5-membered ring (cyclic urea-like structure).
2. **Polarity**: The presence of two highly polar amide groups suggests moderate polarity, but the cyclic structure may reduce solubility compared to linear amides.
3. **Similar Examples**:
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property: **-0.75682223**): This is a cyclic urea derivative with two amides and alkyl substituents. The property is negative and moderately low.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property: **-0.18968932**): This is a cyclic imide with alkyl side chains. The property is slightly negative but higher than the previous example due to less symmetry and more alkylation.
   - **O=C1CCCN1** (property: **0.55372488**): A simple cyclic amide (lactam) with a positive property value, likely due to less steric hindrance and polarity.

### Key Observations:
- Cyclic structures with multiple amides tend to have **negative or low-positive property values**, especially if symmetric (e.g., **-0.756** for the cyclic urea).
- The given molecule is symmetric (no alkyl substituents) and has two rigid amide groups, which may lower the property value further compared to less constrained examples like **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (-0.189).
- The lack of flexible alkyl chains or aromaticity (which often increases the property, e.g., aromatic imides like **3.3991649**) suggests a value closer to the cyclic urea example.

### Prediction:
Given the symmetry, rigidity, and lack of aromaticity/alkylation, the property value is likely **negative and moderately low**, similar to **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (-0.756) but slightly higher due to the fused ring system (cyclopentane). 

**Predicted property value: -0.45**  
*(Estimated range: -0.5 to -0.4 based on structural similarity to the examples.)*

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.2986224684770769
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property value tends to increase with the presence of multiple halogen atoms (Cl, Br, I), aromatic rings, and larger molecular size. The molecule in question is **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, which consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with three chlorine substituents (two on one ring and one on the other). 

This structure is similar to **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (property = 2.06276463), which has more chlorine atoms but a comparable aromatic system. The given molecule has fewer chlorines but still exhibits significant aromaticity and halogenation. 

Considering the trend:
- Molecules with multiple chlorines and aromatic systems tend to have property values in the range of **0.2 to 2.0**.
- The presence of two connected aromatic rings (biphenyl-like structure) with chlorines suggests a value on the higher end of this range, but not as high as the heavily chlorinated example (2.062).

Thus, a reasonable prediction for **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** would be slightly lower than 2.062 but still significant. 

**Predicted property value: 1.85** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the given data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured—e.g., logP, solubility, binding affinity—this is an empirical estimate based on the provided examples.)

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.7353151858619423
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, molecular weight, and aromaticity. The molecule in question is **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1**, which is **diethylbenzene** (specifically, the 1,4-isomer based on the symmetry). 

This is a relatively non-polar, aromatic hydrocarbon with no strongly polar or ionizable functional groups. Comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (heptylbenzene) has a property value of **-0.61708777**.  
   - This is a non-polar aromatic with a longer alkyl chain. Diethylbenzene is similar but with shorter alkyl chains.

2. **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline) has a property value of **0.04460246**.  
   - This has a slightly polar NH group, which increases the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

3. **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine) has a property value of **-0.15320896**.  
   - This is a heteroaromatic with a polar nitrogen, yet still relatively low property value.

Given that diethylbenzene is purely hydrocarbon (no heteroatoms or polar groups), its property value should be slightly lower than heptylbenzene due to the shorter alkyl chains reducing hydrophobic contributions. However, the exact value is hard to pinpoint precisely without a clear trend formula, but it should fall in the range of **-0.6 to -0.8**.

### Predicted property value for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1**:  
**-0.70** (approximate, based on similarity to heptylbenzene and other non-polar aromatics in the dataset).  

*(Note: If this property is logP or a related hydrophobicity metric, the value aligns well with expectations for such a molecule.)*

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7580711660694914
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains an **aniline (Nc1ccccc1)** core, similar to some examples like **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (property: -0.03478007) and **c1c(NC(=O)c2ccccc2(I))cccc1** (property: 0.09155639).
2. **Substituent**: The aniline is substituted with a **sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O)**, which is polar and electron-withdrawing, similar to nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**) in other examples (e.g., **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**).
3. **Electron-Withdrawing Nature**: The sulfonamide group is strongly electron-withdrawing, likely reducing the property value compared to simpler anilines (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1** has a property of 0.25918891).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: Property = -0.03478007  
  (Nitro group is electron-withdrawing, similar to sulfonamide but slightly less polar.)
- **c1c(NC(=O)c2ccccc2(I))cccc1**: Property = 0.09155639  
  (Amide substituent is less electron-withdrawing than sulfonamide.)
- **Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O**: Property = -0.55420027  
  (Two nitro groups make it more electron-withdrawing than a single sulfonamide.)

### Prediction:
The sulfonamide group is more polar and electron-withdrawing than a single nitro group but less so than two nitro groups. Thus, the property value should be lower than **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-0.03478007)** but higher than **Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (-0.55420027)**. A reasonable estimate would be slightly more negative than -0.03478007 due to the stronger electron-withdrawing effect of the sulfonamide.

### Predicted Property:
**-0.15** (This is a conservative estimate based on the trend observed in the examples.)  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: -0.2611760968602672
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings, forming a **tetracene-like structure** (though not linear; it's a bent or angular arrangement). The SMILES notation breaks down as:
- **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**: This describes a system where:
  - Ring 1: Benzene (c1ccc...)
  - Ring 2: Fused to ring 1 (c2...)
  - Rings 3 and 4: Additional fused benzene rings (c3..., c4...), creating a "kinked" or angular tetracyclic structure.

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple benzene (e.g., `C1CCCC1` cyclohexane) has a low value (~0.16), but aromaticity increases complexity.
   - Naphthalene-like systems (e.g., `c1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32`) have values around **-0.486** to **0.922** (for larger fused systems).
   - The molecule `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` (a pentacyclic PAH) has a value of **0.9216**, while a similar but less substituted system (`c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54`) has **1.4279**.

2. **Chlorinated/Substituted Aromatics**:
   - Highly chlorinated systems (e.g., hexachlorobenzene derivatives) have very high values (e.g., **7.0229**), but this is due to electronegative halogens.
   - Unsubstituted PAHs tend to have moderate positive values when large.

3. **This Molecule**:
   - It is an unsubstituted tetracyclic PAH (4 fused rings, bent structure).
   - Larger than naphthalene but smaller than the pentacyclic examples (~0.92–1.43).
   - No heteroatoms or electronegative groups to drastically increase the value.

### Prediction:
Given its size and similarity to the pentacyclic PAH with value **1.4279**, but with one fewer ring, a reasonable estimate would be slightly lower. The angular fusion might also slightly reduce the value compared to linear fused systems.

**Predicted Property Value: ~1.20**  
*(A conservative estimate between 0.92 and 1.43, accounting for size and structure.)*  

---
**Final Answer:** **1.20** (approximate).  
*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on interpolation from similar structures in the dataset.)*

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 0.38849826247579716
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and hydrogen bonding potential. 

The molecule in question is:  
**Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**

### Key structural features:
1. **Multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)**: These contribute to hydrogen bonding and polarity, which in the examples often correlate with mid-range positive values (e.g., `Oc1cccc(O)c1` has a value of `0.42242187`).
2. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains fused and linked aromatic rings, which in the examples can lead to moderate values (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45` has `1.41821361`).
3. **Carbonyl group (C=O)**: This adds polarity and may increase the property value slightly.
4. **Ether linkage (Oc)**: Present in some examples with mixed effects on the property value.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The molecule resembles polyphenolic or flavonoid-like structures with multiple -OH groups and aromaticity. Examples like `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl` (value `2.10494578`) or `Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4` (value `2.41521787`) suggest that such features can lead to values in the range of **2.0 to 3.0**.
- The lack of halogens (which sometimes increase or decrease values unpredictably) and the presence of more -OH groups may push the value toward the higher end of this range.

### Predicted property value:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate would be **~2.5**. 

**Final answer:** `2.51234567` (approximated based on structural similarity to examples).

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 0.1290522893485605
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., P=O, P=S)**:
   - Molecules with phosphate/thiophosphate groups tend to have higher property values (often > 2.0). For example:
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` → **2.679**
     - `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` → **2.881**
     - `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` → **17.464** (very high due to multiple functional groups).

2. **Chlorine substitution**:
   - Highly chlorinated aromatic rings increase the property value (e.g., `ClC1(C(=O)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C14Cl)C5(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C45Cl` → **7.023**).

3. **Simple alkanes/alcohols**:
   - Small or linear alkanes/alcohols have low or negative values (e.g., `CCCCC` → **0.255**, `CCC(O)CC` → **0.174**).

4. **Amides/thioamides**:
   - Presence of `NC=O` or `SC=O` groups can moderately increase the value (e.g., `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` → **0.159**).

5. **Combination of P=O and S**:
   - The molecule `COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC` contains:
     - A phosphate group (`P=O`),
     - A thioester (`SC`),
     - An amide (`NC(C)=O`).
   - This combination suggests a higher property value, similar to other phosphorus-containing molecules.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to molecules like `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (property = 2.881) but with fewer chlorines and an amide/thioester instead of chlorinated aromatics, the value should be slightly lower but still in the **~2.0–3.0 range**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** is **2.45**. 

*(This estimate balances the contributions of the phosphate, thioester, and amide groups while accounting for the absence of highly chlorinated or aromatic systems.)*

Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 1.2848896607528124
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes**: 
   - **CC1CCCC1** (cyclohexane): -0.20567234  
   - **CCCC(C)C** (branched alkane): -0.09984496  
   - **CC1=CCCCC1** (cyclohexene): -0.32646692  
   - **CCC=O** (butanal): 1.76648609 (higher due to polar carbonyl)  
   - **CCCC(=C)C** (branched alkene): 0.25528745  

   Simple hydrocarbons tend to have property values close to zero, with slight variations based on branching or unsaturation. Alkenes (C=C) tend to have slightly higher values than alkanes.

2. **Chlorinated Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): 1.41333947  
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (dichlorophenol): -0.35850388  
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (chloroaniline): -0.01426141  
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: -0.63145791  

   Chlorine substituents generally increase the property value compared to non-chlorinated analogs, but the effect depends on the rest of the structure. For example, aromatic chlorination tends to increase the value more than aliphatic chlorination.

3. **Dichloroethene (Cl\C=C/Cl)**:
   - This is a simple alkene with two chlorine atoms. From the examples:
     - **CCC=O** (butanal, polar): 1.76648609  
     - **CCCC(=C)C** (branched alkene): 0.25528745  
     - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)...**: 1.41333947 (aromatic chlorination)  
     - **CCBr**: 0.63708112 (bromine substituent)  

   The presence of two chlorines on an alkene will likely increase the property value compared to a simple alkene or alkane. However, since it's not aromatic, the effect may not be as large as in chlorinated aromatics.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Simple alkenes are around 0.2–0.3 (e.g., **CCCC(=C)C**: 0.25528745).  
- Chlorine substituents add to this, but not as much as in aromatic systems.  
- **CCBr** (bromine substituent) is 0.63708112, and chlorine is less polarizable than bromine, so the effect might be slightly smaller.  

A reasonable estimate for **Cl\C=C/Cl** would be in the range of **0.4 to 0.7**.  

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl: 0.55**  

This is based on the alkene baseline (~0.25) plus the incremental effect of two chlorines (~0.15–0.25 each), but not as high as aromatic chlorination or polar carbonyls.
==================================================
Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 0.973662096176141
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple aromatic rings without polar substituents tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative. For example:
     - **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline): **0.00126515**
     - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43** (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon): **1.42788518**
     - **c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1** (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon): **0.36805973**
   - The presence of nitrogen in the aromatic ring (as in pyridine) may slightly influence the property, but the effect is not drastic in the examples.

2. **Heteroatoms**:
   - Nitrogen in aromatic systems (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2**): **0.64624286**
     - However, this molecule has multiple functional groups, so the nitrogen's contribution is hard to isolate.
   - **COc5cc4OCC3Oc2c1CC(Oc1ccc2C(=O)C3c4cc5OC)C(C)=C**: **7.69571072**
     - This is an outlier with a very high value, likely due to complex structure and multiple heteroatoms.

3. **Simple Heterocycles**:
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (a purine derivative): **-0.53121605**
     - This is a fused nitrogen-containing heterocycle, but pyridine is simpler.
   - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12** (a diazine derivative): **-0.46549442**
     - Again, fused nitrogen heterocycles with more nitrogens than pyridine.

4. **Pyridine-Like Structures**:
   - No exact pyridine examples are given, but **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (a fused nitrogen heterocycle): **-0.74436244**
     - This is more complex than pyridine, so pyridine's value should be less negative.

### Prediction for Pyridine (c1ccncc1):
- Pyridine is a simple aromatic heterocycle with one nitrogen. From the examples, simple aromatic systems with mild polarity (like pyridine) tend to have property values close to zero, slightly negative or positive.
- The nitrogen in pyridine introduces polarity, but not as much as in polycyclic or highly substituted systems.
- Given the trends, I would predict a value slightly negative but close to zero, similar to **CNc1ccccc1** (0.00126515) or **Oc1cccc(Cl)c1** (0.04864546).

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for c1ccncc1: -0.15**  
(Reasoning: Slightly negative due to the nitrogen's electronegativity, but not as negative as fused or polycyclic systems.)

Iteration: 59
SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 4.15134920038744
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size/complexity. Here's how I would approach predicting the property for the molecule:

**Molecule:**  
`OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23`

### Key Features:
1. **Polar functional groups**:  
   - Multiple hydroxyl groups (`OCC(O)CO-`) → Increase polarity (likely decreases the property value, as seen in polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` with value `-0.583`).  
   - Ester (`COC(=O)-`) → Moderate polarity (esters in the examples have negative values, e.g., `CCOC(=O)CC` is `-0.739`).  
   - Aromatic amine (`Nc2ccnc3...`) → Polarity and basicity (amines in the examples vary, but aromatic substitution tends to lower the value).  

2. **Aromatic systems**:  
   - Two fused aromatic rings with a pyridine (`c2ccnc3`) and benzene (`ccc23`) → Aromaticity tends to lower the value (e.g., polyaromatics like `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54` have positive values, but smaller fused systems like `c1ccc2cnccc2c1` are negative).  

3. **Halogenation**:  
   - Chlorine substitution (`cc(Cl)ccc23`) → Halogens can increase or decrease the value depending on context (e.g., `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` is `-0.655`, but `Cl\C=C/Cl` is `1.284`).  

4. **Molecular size/complexity**:  
   - Large, multifunctional molecule → Larger systems with mixed features tend to have moderate negative values (e.g., `CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2` is `-0.592`).  

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The molecule resembles a mix of polyols, esters, and aromatic amines with halogenation.  
- Similar examples:  
  - `CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2` (value `-0.592`) → Ester + aromatic + ether.  
  - `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` (value `-0.593`) → Aromatic amide.  
  - `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (value `-0.754`) → Polychlorinated phenol.  

Given the combination of polar groups, aromaticity, and halogenation, the property value is likely in the moderately negative range, similar to other complex polar aromatics.  

### Predicted Value:  
**-0.65** (approximate, based on the trends observed in the examples).  

This aligns with the observed values for molecules with comparable features (e.g., `-0.592` to `-0.754` for polar aromatic systems with halogens or esters).
==================================================
Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 0.13835058118082824
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, size, and aromaticity. The molecule in question is **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), which is a linear aliphatic alcohol with a hydroxyl group (-OH) at the end of a 5-carbon chain.

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Aliphatic chains with polar groups**: 
   - Molecules like **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tert-butanol) have a property value of **-0.38900569**.
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol) has a value of **-0.75546235**.
   - **CCC(C)Cl** (2-chlorobutane) has a value of **0.33044106**, suggesting that halogens can increase the property value compared to alcohols.

2. **Linear alcohols**:
   - The closest example is **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**, but **CCCCCO** is a simpler linear alcohol. Linear alcohols are more polar than branched ones, which might slightly decrease the property value (more negative).

3. **Trend for aliphatic chains**:
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene) has a value of **-0.57851913**.
   - **CCCCCCCI** (1-iodohexane) has a value of **-0.60477536**.
   - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C** (a complex steroid-like molecule) has a very high value (**10.99034075**), but this is an outlier due to its size and multiple functional groups.

### Prediction for **CCCCCO**:
- The hydroxyl group adds polarity, but the linear chain reduces steric effects compared to branched alcohols.
- Comparing to **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (-0.38900569), **CCCCCO** is likely more negative due to its linearity and lack of branching.
- A reasonable estimate would be slightly more negative than **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** but less negative than **OC1CCCCCCC1** (-0.75546235).

### Predicted property value for **CCCCCO**:
**-0.65** (approximate, based on the trend observed in the examples). 

This is a rough estimate, as the exact property being predicted is not explicitly defined (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), but the value fits the trend for linear aliphatic alcohols in the given data.

Iteration: 61
SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 1.6094001381916783
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: The presence of a benzene ring is common in many examples. For instance:
   - **Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2**: -0.75358369 (two aromatic rings with amino groups)
   - **Oc1ccc(O)cc1**: 0.42242187 (aromatic ring with hydroxyl groups)
   - **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1**: -0.73531519 (aromatic ring with alkyl substitutions)

   Aromatic rings with substitutions often contribute negatively to the property unless polar groups (e.g., -OH, -F) are present.

2. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: Seen in:
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1**: -0.43725275 (amide with aromatic ring and fluorine)
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC**: -0.76592224 (cyclic amide)

   Amides tend to lower the property value, especially when attached to aromatic rings.

3. **Sulfonyl Group (S(=O)(=O))**: This is a polar, electron-withdrawing group. Examples with sulfonyl or similar polar groups:
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: 3.16076349 (phosphorothioate with nitro group)
   - **CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C**: 8.8075239 (complex polar structure)

   Sulfonyl groups can increase the property value, but the effect depends on the rest of the molecule.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring (CCO1)**: The five-membered ring with oxygen and sulfur is somewhat similar to:
   - **Sc2nc1ccccc1s2**: -0.76355069 (heterocyclic with sulfur and nitrogen)
   - **Cc1c[nH]c(=O)[nH]c1=O**: 0.17798563 (heterocyclic with polar groups)

   Heterocycles with polar atoms often have mid-range or negative values.

5. **Alkyl Group (CC)**: The methyl group attached to the heterocycle is a minor contributor unless the molecule is highly aliphatic (e.g., **CCCCCCCCCCCCCC**: 1.32892973).

### Synthesis of Features:
- The molecule combines an aromatic ring (negative contribution), an amide (negative), a sulfonyl group (positive), and a heterocycle (likely negative or neutral). 
- The sulfonyl group is the most polar and likely dominates, but the amide and aromatic ring pull the value down. 
- The closest analog is **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (3.16076349), but our molecule lacks the nitro group and has an amide instead, which would reduce the value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of features, the property value is likely **between 0.5 and 1.5**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 0.85** (moderate polarity from sulfonyl, offset by amide and aromatic ring). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data.)

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 2.195920604928717
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, I'll analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular size, polarity, functional groups, and aromaticity. Here's my reasoning:

**Given Molecule:**
`COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C`

**Key Features:**
1. **Aromatic System**: Contains a benzene ring (`c2ccccc2`) with an electron-withdrawing nitro group (`N(=O)=O`), which increases polarity.
2. **Multiple Ester Groups**: Two methoxycarbonyl groups (`C(=O)OC`), which are polar and moderately large.
3. **Amide-like Structure**: The `NC(=C)` fragment resembles an enamine or amide-like structure, adding polarity.
4. **Substituents**: Methyl groups (`C`) add some hydrophobicity but are outweighed by the polar groups.
5. **Conjugation**: Extended conjugation across the structure (benzene + ester + NC=C) likely increases stability and size.

**Comparison to Examples:**
- Molecules with nitro groups and aromatic systems (e.g., `Cc1cccc(N=O)=O`) have values around -0.2 to -0.7, but this is outweighed by the larger size here.
- Molecules with multiple ester/amide groups and aromaticity (e.g., `CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC`) have high values (~13.3), but this is smaller.
- A closer match is `CC2Cc1ccccc1N2NC(=O)c3ccc(Cl)c(c3)S(N)(=O)=O` (value = 6.504), which has an aromatic system, polar groups (sulfonamide), and moderate size.

**Prediction:**
Given the two ester groups, nitro group, and aromatic system, the property value should be **between 4.5 and 6.5**. A reasonable estimate is **5.8**.

**Final Answer:**  
Predicted property value: **5.8** (estimated range: 5.5–6.2).

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.49975923389641025
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**C(=O)N**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). The amide groups are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding, while the cyclopropane ring introduces strain and rigidity.
2. **Symmetry**: The molecule is symmetric, with two identical amide groups flanking the cyclopropane ring. Symmetric molecules often have predictable properties based on their repeating units.
3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with amide groups (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1**, property = -0.765) tend to have negative property values, but this depends on other substituents.
   - Rigid or strained rings (e.g., **C1CCCCC1**, property = -0.289) often have less negative values compared to flexible chains.
   - The symmetric diketopiperazine-like core (two amides in a ring) is not directly represented in the examples, but similar cyclic diamides or imides might hint at intermediate values.

### Key Observations:
- The cyclopropane ring is small and strained, which could increase the property value slightly compared to larger rings.
- The two amide groups would typically lower the property value (as seen in other amide-containing examples), but the rigidity and symmetry might counteract this effect.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the polar amides (tending toward negative values) and the rigid, strained cyclopropane ring (tending toward less negative or positive values), the property is likely **close to zero but slightly positive**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.25**  

This aligns with:
- Similar small, rigid systems (e.g., **CC(=O)C(C)(C)C**, property = 0.21).
- The symmetry and strain offsetting the polarity of the amides. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, dipole moment, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend of the given data.)

   - **CCC(C)(C)CC** (branched alkane): **-0.37629351**
   - **CCCCC** (pentane): **0.25528745**

   Halogens (especially chlorine) tend to reduce the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons, but the effect depends on the number of halogens and the complexity of the molecule.

2. **Small Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl** (hexachlorinated complex structure): **3.49985116**
   - **ClCC** is much simpler, so we expect a much lower value.

3. **Chlorinated Alkanes**:
   - The simplest chlorinated alkane in the examples is **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) with **0.18646355**. 
   - **ClCC** (chloroethane) is even simpler and lacks aromaticity, so its value should be lower than chlorobenzene but higher than heavily chlorinated or branched structures.

4. **Trend for Small Chloroalkanes**:
   - Small chloroalkanes (like chloroethane) are likely to have property values in the range of **0.1 to 0.5**, but the presence of chlorine pulls it down slightly compared to pure alkanes (e.g., **CCCCC** has **0.25528745**).

### Prediction for **ClCC**:
- Chloroethane is a small, non-aromatic molecule with one chlorine. 
- Compared to chlorobenzene (**0.18646355**), it lacks conjugation/aromaticity, so its value should be lower.
- Compared to pentachlorobenzene (**-0.73252503**), it has only one chlorine, so its value should be higher.
- The closest analog is **CCCCC** (pentane, **0.25528745**), but with chlorine replacing a hydrogen, the value should decrease slightly.

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for **ClCC** is:  
**0.12** (slightly lower than chlorobenzene but higher than heavily chlorinated/branched molecules).

### Final Answer:
**0.12**

Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: -0.765287936782581
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (n1)** substituted with a **chlorine (Cl)** and a **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (trichloromethyl)** group. 
2. **Chlorine Substitution**: The presence of multiple chlorines (4 in total) is notable. From the examples, highly chlorinated molecules like **ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C4(Cl)C5(Cl)C1(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl** (10.115) and **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl** (-0.636) show that chlorination can lead to either very high or moderately negative values, depending on other functional groups.
3. **Aromatic System**: The pyridine ring is aromatic, similar to benzene derivatives in the examples. Aromaticity alone does not strongly correlate with high or low values (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)sc3ccccc23** is -0.542, while **c1ccc2c3c(ccc2c1)c4cccc5cccc3c45** is 1.427).
4. **Trichloromethyl Group**: The **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group is present in **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O** (2.602) and **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (2.062), both of which have positive values > 2. This suggests that **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** tends to increase the property value.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (2.062): This has two aromatic rings and a **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group, similar to our target (but with an extra aromatic ring). The value is positive but not extremely high.
- **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O** (2.602): This has a **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group and additional polar groups (S, N, C=O), leading to a higher value.
- **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl** (-0.636): This is highly chlorinated but has a **N(=O)=O** group, which may suppress the value.

### Prediction:
The target molecule has:
- A pyridine ring (moderate influence, likely negative or neutral).
- A **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group (strong positive influence, as seen in other examples).
- No strongly negative functional groups (like **N(=O)=O**).

Given the **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group's tendency to push the value above 2 in similar contexts, but with only one aromatic ring (unlike the 2.062 example), I predict a slightly lower value. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 1.85**  
(Rationale: Between the 2.062 and 2.602 examples but accounting for the simpler structure.)

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.2513708412916401
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can analyze the given molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (which is 2-hexanol) and predict its property value by comparing it to similar structures in the dataset.

### Observations from the Dataset:
1. **Alcohols with short/linear chains**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (4-heptanol): Property value = **-0.58674077**
   - **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol): Property value = **-0.2245963**
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (1-phenylethanol): Property value = **-0.31511534**
   - **CC(O)CCC** (2-pentanol, not explicitly listed but similar to the above): The trend suggests values around **-0.3 to -0.6**.

2. **Branching effects**:
   - Branching tends to slightly increase the property value (less negative) compared to linear alcohols (e.g., **CCC(C)CCO** is less negative than **CCCC(O)CCC**).

3. **Chain length**:
   - Longer chains (e.g., **CCCC(O)CCC**) tend to have more negative values than shorter ones (e.g., **CCC(C)CCO**).

### Analysis of **CCCCC(C)O**:
- This is **2-hexanol**, a branched alcohol with a 6-carbon chain.
- It is structurally similar to **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol) but with one additional carbon in the main chain.
- The branching (methyl group at the second carbon) will slightly increase the property value compared to a linear alcohol like **CCCC(O)CCC**.
- However, the longer chain (6 carbons vs. 5 in **CCC(C)CCO**) will pull the value slightly more negative.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, I estimate the property value for **CCCCC(C)O** to be between **-0.4 and -0.5**. A reasonable interpolation from the examples suggests:  
**Predicted value: -0.45**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the dataset. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or additional data would be needed.)

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.6977115957757967
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogen Substitution (Cl/Br)**:
   - Molecules with chlorine substitutions tend to have property values that are moderately negative or positive, depending on the number and position of halogens.
   - Example: **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **-0.59012039**.
   - Example: **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** (hexachlorinated biphenyl-like structure) has a higher value of **1.46126842**, suggesting that more halogens increase the property value.

2. **Bromine vs. Chlorine**:
   - Bromine is heavier and more polarizable than chlorine, which may slightly increase the property value compared to chlorine analogs.
   - Example: **CI** (iodomethane) has a value of **0.12579247**, suggesting heavier halogens contribute positively.

3. **Symmetry and Position of Halogens**:
   - Para-disubstituted benzene rings (e.g., 1,4-substitution) tend to have values around **-0.5 to -0.6** for chlorine, but bromine's higher polarizability may offset this slightly.

4. **Comparison to Similar Structures**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**: -0.59012039 (1,4-dichlorobenzene)
   - **Clc1ccccc1**: Likely similar (not in examples, but monochlorobenzene would be lower).
   - Bromine is expected to increase the value slightly compared to chlorine.

### Prediction:
For **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene):
- The property value should be slightly higher than the chlorine analog (**-0.59012039**) due to bromine's greater polarizability and size.
- A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **-0.4 to -0.5**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is **-0.45000000**. 

*(This is an approximate interpolation based on the trend observed in the examples. For higher precision, statistical modeling or more data would be needed.)*

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 1.4037000580560157
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the provided examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds** tend to have **higher positive values** for this property. For example:
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (a hexachlorinated biphenyl-like structure) has a value of **5.69981584**.
   - The given molecule is also a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-like structure**, but with fewer chlorines (6 chlorines vs. 12 in the example above).

2. **Less chlorinated or smaller aromatic systems** have lower values:
   - **ClC(Br)Br** (a simple halogenated alkane) has a value of **-0.22881649**.
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (a nitrotoluene) has a value of **-0.22373086**.

3. The property seems to **increase with the number of chlorines and aromatic rings**.

### Given Molecule:
- The molecule is **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**, which is a **dichlorinated biphenyl with 6 chlorines total** (3 on each ring).
- Structurally, it is similar to the example with 12 chlorines but with half the chlorination.

### Prediction:
- The example with 12 chlorines has a value of **5.69981584**.
- This molecule has **6 chlorines**, so we expect a **lower but still significant positive value**.
- Comparing to other examples, a reasonable estimate would be roughly **half the value of the fully chlorinated biphenyl**, but likely higher due to aromaticity and biphenyl structure.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: ~3.2**  
*(This is an educated guess based on the trend; the actual value may vary slightly.)*  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured—e.g., logP, polarizability, or another descriptor—this is a generalized prediction based on the given data.)*

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 8.289520680198585
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and polarity. The molecule in question is:

**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

This is a relatively large and complex molecule with:
- A central phosphate group (P=O) with two aromatic ester linkages (O-aryl groups).
- Multiple aromatic rings (phenyl groups) with methyl substituents.
- Significant polarity due to the phosphate group and ether linkages.

Comparing this to the examples:
- Molecules with phosphate groups (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O`, property = 15.871) or `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC`, property = 9.671) tend to have high property values due to their polarity and complexity.
- However, this molecule lacks sulfur (which appears to increase the property value in some cases) and has less extreme electronegativity differences than some of the highest examples.

Given its size, polarity, and functional groups, but absence of highly electronegative atoms like sulfur or nitro groups, a reasonable estimate would be **~6.5 to 8.0**. 

A precise prediction based on the trend is challenging without a clear pattern, but a plausible value is:  
**Predicted property value: 7.25**  

*(This is an educated guess based on the examples, assuming the property scales with molecular complexity and polarity.)*

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.726201490206868
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: This is a highly electronegative and lipophilic group. From the examples, molecules with CF3 (e.g., `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` with CF3) tend to have higher property values (e.g., 2.803). 
2. **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The molecule has a benzene ring with a CF3 and a heterocyclic amide group. Aromatic systems with electronegative substituents (e.g., NO2, Cl) often have negative or modest values, but CF3 can increase the property.
3. **Chlorinated heterocycle (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O)**: This is a chlorinated pyrrolidinone-like structure. Chlorine atoms (especially multiple Cl) tend to increase the property (e.g., `ClC1=C(Cl)C(Cl)(C(=C1Cl)Cl)C2(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C(=C2Cl)Cl)Cl` has a high value of 4.385).
4. **Polarity and complexity**: The molecule is polar and structurally complex, similar to some of the higher-valued examples.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The presence of CF3 and multiple Cl atoms suggests a higher property value, similar to molecules like `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` (1.461) or `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` (2.803).
- The heterocyclic amide with Cl might reduce the value slightly compared to purely chlorinated hydrocarbons, but the CF3 counteracts this.

### Predicted Value:
Given the balance of these features, the property value is likely in the range of **1.5 to 2.5**. A reasonable estimate is **1.85**.

### Final Answer:
**1.85**

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.3103848836120938
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a **nitro-substituted anisole** (methoxybenzene with a nitro group). 
   - The nitro group (**N(=O)=O**) is strongly electron-withdrawing.
   - The methoxy group (**OCH3**) is electron-donating (resonance and inductive effects).

2. **Similar Examples**:
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): Property = **-0.2882902**
     - This has two nitro groups, which are strongly electron-withdrawing, leading to a negative value.
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol): Property = **0.58775623**
     - The hydroxyl group is electron-donating, leading to a positive value.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** vs. **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**:
     - The nitro group alone (as in the target molecule) is less electron-withdrawing than two nitro groups, but the methoxy group counteracts this with its electron-donating effect.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The nitro group tends to decrease the property value (more negative).
   - The methoxy group tends to increase the property value (more positive).
   - The net effect is likely a balance between these two opposing influences.

### Predicted Property:
Given the competing effects of the nitro and methoxy groups, the property value is expected to be **moderately positive**, similar to phenol but slightly lower due to the nitro group's influence. 

From the examples:
- Phenol (**c1ccccc1O**) = **0.58775623**
- Dinitrobenzene (**O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**) = **-0.2882902**

The target molecule (**COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**) has one nitro and one methoxy, so the value should lie between these two, likely closer to phenol but adjusted downward. 

**Predicted Property: ~0.35**

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is approximately **0.35**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data. If the property is something like "logP" or "polar surface area," the reasoning would differ.)

Iteration: 72
SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 4.22635588282956
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and the presence of specific functional groups or halogens (Cl, Br, F). The molecule in question is highly chlorinated and has a complex polycyclic structure, which suggests a higher property value due to the cumulative effect of multiple chlorine atoms and steric complexity.

Here’s the reasoning:
1. **Highly chlorinated molecules** in the examples (e.g., `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl`) have property values that are modest (e.g., 0.05951572), but this is for a simpler cyclohexane derivative. The molecule here is far more complex and heavily chlorinated.
2. **Steric complexity**: The molecule is a polycyclic system with multiple fused rings and chlorine substituents, which increases its bulk and likely its property value. Compare to `CC(=O)C3(C)CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (property value: 9.33385248), which is also highly complex but lacks halogens. The chlorines here may offset some of this effect.
3. **Polarity and halogen effects**: Chlorine atoms introduce polarity and electron-withdrawing effects, but in this case, the sheer number of them likely dominates.

Given these factors, the predicted property value for `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` would be **moderate to high**, similar to other highly halogenated or complex structures in the dataset. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 2.5 to 4.0**  
(More precisely, **~3.2**, based on interpolation with similar examples.)  

However, since the examples include very high values (e.g., 9.33 for a steroid-like structure) and lower values for simpler halogenated systems, this molecule's value likely falls in the middle due to its extreme chlorination but lack of other functional groups. 

Final prediction: **3.456** (a weighted guess based on the dataset trends).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.8085180766865039
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains and Functional Groups**:
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexane): -0.5918  
     (Non-polar, aliphatic cyclic hydrocarbon)
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne): 1.7695  
     (Presence of a triple bond increases the property value)
   - **CC#N** (acetonitrile): 2.9749  
     (Nitrile group significantly increases the property value)
   - **CC(Cl)Cl** (1,1-dichloroethane): 0.9209  
     (Chlorine substituents increase the property value)
   - **CC(Cl)CCl** (1,2-dichloroethane): 0.2248  
     (Less clustered halogens reduce the effect compared to CC(Cl)Cl)

2. **Esters and Carbonyl-Containing Compounds**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: -0.6915  
     (Ethyl ester with an aromatic amine substituent)
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2**: 1.7024  
     (More complex ester with ether and aromatic groups)
   - **CC(=O)CCC1C(=O)N(N(C1=O)c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3**: 3.1072  
     (Multiple carbonyls and aromatic rings increase the property value)

3. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl phenyl ether): -0.3151  
     (Ether linkage with aromatic ring)
   - **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**: -0.7552  
     (Complex carbonyl/nitro groups decrease the property value)

4. **Simple Esters**:
   - **CCCOC=O** is a simple aliphatic ester (propyl formate).  
     Similar to **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (-0.6915) but without the aromatic amine.  
     Simpler esters like this tend to have moderately negative property values.

### Prediction for **CCCOC=O**:
- The molecule is a small aliphatic ester with no aromatic or highly polar substituents.  
- Compared to **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (-0.6915), **CCCOC=O** lacks the aromatic ring and amine, which likely reduces the magnitude of the property value.  
- Similar small esters or ethers (e.g., **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2** = 1.7024) have higher values when more complex, but simple esters are closer to **-0.3 to -0.7**.  
- The propyl group is slightly larger than ethyl but not significantly impactful.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, the property value for **CCCOC=O** is likely in the range of **-0.4 to -0.6**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.52**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on interpolating the given examples. The value is most consistent with small aliphatic esters in the dataset.)
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.09642104810033388
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains (Alkanes/Alkenes):**
   - **CC** (ethane): 2.41363215 (very high)
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): -0.61708777
   - **CCC1CCCCC1** (propylcyclohexane): -0.73319954
   - **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (branched aldehyde): -0.70177185
   - **C=CCC=C** (butadiene): 1.30001244 (high due to conjugation)
   - **CCCC=C(CC)C=O** (unsaturated aldehyde): -0.58681423

   Long hydrocarbon chains or aliphatic structures tend to have **negative or low positive values**, unless they are very small (like ethane) or conjugated (like butadiene).

2. **Functional Groups:**
   - **Esters (COOR):** 
     - **COCC(=O)N(...)** (ester with aromatic): 0.57758754
     - **CCOC(=O)...** (ester in complex molecules): varies widely (e.g., 9.83427695 for a phosphorothioate ester, but this is an outlier due to other features).
     - Simpler esters like **CCOC(=O)CC...** are not directly represented, but esters generally seem to have **moderate positive or near-zero values** unless other features dominate.
   - **Carboxylic Acids (COOH):** Not directly present in examples, but **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** is an ester derivative of a fatty acid (decanoyl ethyl ester).
   - **Oxygenated Groups (OH, O-):**
     - **Oc1ccc(O)cc1** (catechol): 0.42242187
     - **OCC(O)C(O)CO** (glycerol): 0.38683729
     - Oxygen tends to **increase the property value slightly** compared to pure hydrocarbons.

3. **Size and Saturation:**
   - Larger aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**) tend to have **lower values** than smaller ones (e.g., **CC**).
   - Unsaturation (e.g., **C=CCC=C**) can **increase the value significantly** due to conjugation.

### Analysis of **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is **ethyl decanoate**, a fatty acid ester with:
  - A long aliphatic chain (**CCCCCCCCC**).
  - An ester group (**C(=O)OCC**).
- The long hydrocarbon chain will **lower the property value** (similar to **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** or **CCC1CCCCC1**).
- The ester group may **slightly increase the value** compared to a pure hydrocarbon, but not drastically (no conjugation or aromaticity).
- No other functional groups (e.g., halogens, nitro, etc.) are present to significantly alter the value.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): -0.61708777 (aromatic + aliphatic chain).
- **CCC1CCCCC1** (propylcyclohexane): -0.73319954 (pure aliphatic).
- **COCC(=O)N(...)** (ester with aromatic): 0.57758754 (ester + aromatic increases value).
- **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (branched aldehyde): -0.70177185 (aliphatic + carbonyl).

Given the long aliphatic chain dominates, but the ester group adds a slight positive contribution, the value should be **slightly higher than pure aliphatics but still negative or near-zero**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.55 to -0.30**.  

A specific prediction:  
**-0.45** (closer to the ester examples but weighted by the long chain).  

However, looking at **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (-0.617) and adjusting slightly upward for the ester, a more precise guess is:  
**-0.50**.  

But since **COCC(=O)N(...)** is 0.577 and **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** is -0.617, the ester seems to add ~1.0 to the value. Thus:  
-0.617 (hexylbenzene) + ~1.0 (ester effect) ≈ **0.38**.  

But this seems too high for such a long chain. Alternatively, the ester effect may be smaller in this context.  

Given the uncertainty, a conservative estimate is:  
**-0.40**.  

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: -0.40** (approximate, likely between -0.6 and -0.2).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.5648203283723155
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol-like core (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)**: Similar to **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = -0.28965535), but with additional substitutions.
2. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: Present in molecules like **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property = 0.64624286) and **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (property = 0.0081724). This group tends to increase the property slightly.
3. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Seen in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = -0.27167709) and **NNc1ccccc1** (property = 0.21684918). Nitro groups can either slightly increase or decrease the property depending on context.
4. **Chlorine substitutions (Cl)**: Present in many examples, with varying effects. Multiple chlorines (e.g., **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**) can decrease the property, but here they are aromatic and may have a less pronounced effect.
5. **Extended conjugation**: The molecule has significant conjugation (aromatic rings + amide + nitro), which may increase the property compared to simpler aromatic systems (e.g., **c1ccccc1** = 0.76385303).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (0.64624286): Shares an amide linkage and chloro-aromatic groups but lacks a nitro group. The nitro group here may slightly increase the property.
- **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (-0.27167709): Simpler nitro-chloro-aromatic system with a lower value. The additional amide and phenol here likely raise the property.
- **CC2Nc1cc(Cl)c(cc1C(=O)N2c3ccccc3C)S(N)(=O)=O** (6.33874122): Contains a sulfonamide and amide, but this is more complex. Our molecule is less polar but still has significant functionality.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of:
- Phenol (-0.28965535),
- Amide (~0.6 in similar contexts),
- Nitro (~0.2 contribution),
- Multiple chlorines (~neutral effect here),
- Extended conjugation (~additive effect),

the property is likely in the range of **0.5 to 1.5**. A reasonable estimate is **~0.85**, balancing the contributions of the functional groups.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 0.85** (rounded to two decimal places).

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 24.583105943940236
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, particularly the presence of heavy atoms (e.g., Cl, S, P), aromatic systems, and functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, nitro groups, halogens). The property values tend to increase with structural complexity, especially when multiple heavy atoms or conjugated systems are present.

Let's analyze the target molecule:  
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**

### Key features:
1. **Phosphorothioate groups (P=S)**: These are present twice, and they significantly increase complexity (similar to the molecule with `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1`, which has a high value of **12.255**).
2. **Aromatic rings with sulfur linkage**: The molecule contains two benzene rings linked by a sulfur atom (thioether) and further substituted with phosphorothioate groups.
3. **Multiple heavy atoms (P, S, O)**: The presence of phosphorus and sulfur (in addition to oxygen) contributes to a higher property value, as seen in other examples with heavy atoms (e.g., Cl-rich molecules have elevated values).

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- The molecule `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` (multiple Cl substitutions) has a value of **1.423**.
- The molecule `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (single P=S but with additional complexity) has a value of **12.255**.
- The molecule `CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (steroid-like structure) has a value of **8.230**.

### Prediction:
The target molecule has **two P=S groups** and a **thioether-linked aromatic system**, making it more complex than most examples but less so than the steroid or the highest-value phosphorothioate example. The symmetry and repetition of functional groups suggest a high value, though not as extreme as the steroid or the most complex phosphorothioate.

**Predicted property value: ~6.5**  
(Reasoning: Between the high-complexity Cl-rich molecules (~1.4–7.0) and the very high-value phosphorothioate (~12.3), but closer to the mid-range due to the repeating P=S motif.)  

**Final answer: 6.8** (rounded estimate based on structural similarity to high-value examples).

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.027279932582217975
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitrophenol-like structures**: 
   - The molecule resembles nitrophenol (phenol with a nitro group). 
   - Example: `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (methyl-substituted nitrobenzene) has a property value of **-0.22373086**.
   - Another example: `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` (hydroxybenzamide) has a value of **-0.12081424**.

2. **Electron-withdrawing groups (NO₂, Cl, etc.)**:
   - Molecules with strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂, Cl) tend to have negative property values. 
   - Example: `Clc1cccc(Br)c1` has **-0.52764519**.
   - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has **-0.6260752**.

3. **Phenol derivatives**:
   - Phenol (`Oc1ccccc1`) is not explicitly in the examples, but substituted phenols with electron-withdrawing groups have negative values.
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, so we expect a negative value.

4. **Comparison to similar structures**:
   - `Nc1cccc(Cl)c1` (chloroaniline) has **-0.01426141**.
   - `CNc1ccccc1` (methylaniline) has **0.00126515**.
   - The nitro group is more electron-withdrawing than Cl or NH₂, so the value should be more negative than these.

### Prediction:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group and the presence of a phenol group, the property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** should be more negative than `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (-0.22373086) but less negative than heavily halogenated phenols like `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (-0.6260752). 

A reasonable estimate would be around **-0.30 to -0.40**. 

Looking at the examples, a plausible predicted value is:  
**-0.35** (specific value: **-0.35000000**). 

However, to match the precision of the given examples, let's pick a value close to the nitrophenol-like structures. A refined prediction is:  
**-0.245** (similar to `CCC1(CCC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2` at **-0.24449189**).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is:  
**-0.245**.

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 11.065757002199978
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is a highly branched oligosaccharide with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) and ether linkages (-O-), which contribute to significant hydrogen bonding and polarity. 

From the examples:
- Molecules with many polar groups (e.g., hydroxyls, sugars) tend to have moderate to high property values (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has -0.26268779, but larger sugars like `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O` have 6.34851401).
- The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages in a large, flexible structure like this suggests a higher property value due to increased molecular interactions.

Comparing to similar structures in the examples, this molecule is most analogous to large, polar, polyhydroxylated compounds. For instance:
- `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O` (6.34851401) is a steroid with hydroxyl and carbonyl groups.
- `CC34CCC1C(CCc2cc(O)ccc12)C3CC(O)C4O` (3.81842227) is another hydroxylated cyclic structure.

This molecule is even more polar and larger, with 10 hydroxyl groups and multiple ether linkages, suggesting a higher property value. 

**Predicted property value: 8.5** (estimated based on its size, polarity, and similarity to other high-value examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 1.7694810004904749
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the given data:
1. **Hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, aromatics):**
   - **Alkanes:** 
     - `CCCC(O)CCC` (heptanol): -0.5867  
     - `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO` (long-chain alcohol): 2.4029  
     - `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO` (very long-chain alcohol): 5.9916  
     - Saturated hydrocarbons with polar groups (e.g., -OH) tend to have higher values as chain length increases.
   - **Alkenes:** 
     - `CCCCCCCCC=C` (nonene): -0.7462  
     - The presence of a double bond slightly lowers the value compared to alkanes.
   - **Alkynes:** 
     - `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (dicyanobenzene): -0.1039  
     - The triple bond here is part of a nitrile group, but pure alkynes are not directly represented. However, alkynes are less polarizable than alkenes, so we might expect a lower value than alkenes.
   - **Aromatics:** 
     - `Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1` (trimethylbenzene): -0.4519  
     - `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32` (polyaromatic): -0.6756  
     - Aromatic rings tend to have negative values, and fused rings lower the value further.

2. **Functional groups:**
   - Polar groups (e.g., -OH, -C=O, -NO2) can increase or decrease the value depending on the context. For example:
     - `CC(=O)C` (butanone): 0.4269  
     - `CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (steroid-like): 9.5013  
     - Carbonyl groups can increase the value significantly in complex structures.
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, I) tend to lower the value:
     - `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1`: -0.5599  
     - `Clc1ccccc1I`: -0.6579  

3. **Small alkynes:**
   - The closest example is `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (dicyanobenzene): -0.1039, but this is not a pure alkyne.  
   - For **CCC#C** (1-butyne), we expect a value similar to or slightly lower than small alkenes (e.g., `CCCCCCCCC=C`: -0.7462) because:
     - The triple bond is less polarizable than a double bond.  
     - It is a small hydrocarbon with no polar groups.  

### Prediction for **CCC#C**:
Given the trends:
- Small hydrocarbons with unsaturation (alkenes/alkynes) have negative values.  
- Alkynes are likely slightly lower than alkenes due to reduced polarizability.  
- The value should be higher than `CCCCCCCCC=C` (-0.7462) because 1-butyne is smaller and less hydrophobic.  

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.2 and -0.4**.  

### Final predicted value:
**-0.25** (interpolated based on the given examples).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. The property could be logP, solubility, or another molecular descriptor, but the approach remains the same.)
==================================================
Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 5.784496106798012
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-Containing Compounds**: 
   - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a very high property value of **12.25540834**. This suggests that the presence of a **P(=S)** group, especially when combined with aromatic rings and halogens (Cl), significantly increases the property value.
   - **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** has a property value of **8.25855675**, which is also high, further supporting the impact of the **P(=S)** group.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Halogens (Cl/Br)**:
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine substitutions on aromatic rings (e.g., **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**) tend to have moderate property values (e.g., **1.41333947**).
   - The presence of **O** or other heteroatoms can modulate the value (e.g., **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** has **-0.1595376**).

3. **Aliphatic Chains and Simple Functional Groups**:
   - Simple alkanes or alcohols (e.g., **CCCCCC**, **CC(C)COC(=O)C**) tend to have low or negative property values.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**. It has:
- A **P(=S)** group, which is strongly associated with high property values in the examples.
- An aromatic ring with **three chlorine substitutions**, which also contributes positively but not as dramatically as the **P(=S)** group.
- An ethoxy group (**CCOP**) and an ethyl group (**CC**) attached to phosphorus, which are less impactful than the **P(=S)** and aromatic Cl substitutions.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog in the examples is **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property value = **12.25540834**). However, the target molecule lacks the **SCC(=O)N** moiety and has fewer substitutions on the aromatic ring.
- Another similar molecule is **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** (property value = **8.25855675**), which has two **P(=S)** groups and ester functionalities, making it more complex.

Given that the target molecule has one **P(=S)** group and a tri-chlorinated aromatic ring but lacks additional polar or complex substituents, its property value should be **lower than 12.25540834 but higher than 8.25855675**. 

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the above, a reasonable prediction for **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** is:

**9.5** (approximate, based on interpolation between the two closest examples). 

However, since the examples suggest that a single **P(=S)** group with aromatic Cl substitutions tends to give values in the **8-12 range**, and the target molecule is less complex than the **12.255** example but more complex than the **8.258** example, a more precise estimate would be:

**10.0** (rounded for simplicity). 

### Final Answer:
**10.0** (predicted property value for **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**).

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.0847405532591261
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (c1nccc)** with a **hydrazide group (C(=O)NN)** attached. 
   - The pyridine ring is aromatic and polar due to the nitrogen atom.
   - The hydrazide group (C(=O)NN) is highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (both donor and acceptor).

2. **Polarity and Functional Groups**:
   - The presence of the hydrazide group suggests significant polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, which often correlates with lower (more negative) property values in the given dataset (e.g., amides and polar groups tend to have negative values).
   - The pyridine nitrogen also adds polarity.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1Cl** (property: -0.0199): Less polar than our molecule (only aniline + chloro substituent).
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (property: -0.7111): Contains a polar amide and chloro groups; our molecule is somewhat similar in polarity but lacks the chloro substituents.
   - **Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2** (property: -0.2589): A polar heterocycle with hydrogen-bonding groups, similar to our molecule but more rigid.
   - **COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1** (property: -0.4205): Polar heterocycle with hydrogen-bonding substituents, similar to our molecule.

4. **Expected Property Range**:
   - Given the polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity, the property value should likely fall in the **moderately negative range**, similar to other polar heterocycles with hydrogen-bonding groups in the dataset (-0.2 to -0.7).

### Prediction:
The molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1** is most comparable to polar heterocycles with hydrogen-bonding substituents in the dataset, which typically have property values between **-0.4 and -0.7**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: -0.55**  

This balances the polarity of the pyridine ring and the strong hydrogen-bonding capability of the hydrazide group.

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 17.463827830287162
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: This is a notable functional group, similar to **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** (property = 1.69046927). The presence of P(=S) often correlates with higher property values (e.g., >1.0 in the examples).
2. **Thioether Linkage (SCC(=O))**: The sulfur atom in the thioether may contribute to the property, though its exact impact is harder to quantify without more examples.
3. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: Present in **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (property = 0.22680365) and other amides, which tend to have moderate positive or negative values depending on the context.
4. **Cyclohexane Ring (N1CCCCC1)**: Aliphatic rings like this often contribute negatively or neutrally (e.g., **C/C1CCCCC1\C** has -0.7030919), but the substitution here may alter this.
5. **Alkyl Chains (CCCO and OCCC)**: These are neutral or slightly negative contributors unless functionalized (e.g., **CCCCCOC(=O)CC** has -0.73939552).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** (property = 1.69046927), which shares the P(=S) group and aromatic substitution. Our molecule lacks the aromatic nitro group but has additional complexity (thioether, amide, and cyclohexane).
- **CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1** (property = 1.00974867) includes a thioether-like linkage and amide, supporting a positive property value.
- The presence of **P(=S)** and **SCC(=O)** suggests a higher value than simple amides or aliphatic chains.

### Synthesis of Features:
- The **P(=S)** group is a strong positive contributor (likely >1.0).
- The **amide** and **thioether** may add modestly (e.g., +0.2 to +0.5 combined).
- The **cyclohexane** and **alkyl chains** may slightly offset this (e.g., -0.3 to -0.5).

### Predicted Property:
Given the dominance of **P(=S)** and the structural similarity to molecules with values ~1.5–2.0, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property = 1.85** (with an expected range of 1.7–2.0 based on the examples).

### Final Answer:
**1.85**
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.7296059313642568
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, functional groups, and aromaticity. The molecule in question is **CCCCCCCC** (octane), which is a simple, non-polar, aliphatic hydrocarbon with no functional groups or aromatic rings.

From the examples:
- **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol) has a property value of **-0.60231999**. This is slightly more polar due to the hydroxyl group but is still a long aliphatic chain.
- **CCCC/C=C/C** (an unsaturated hydrocarbon) has a value of **-0.30858395**, suggesting unsaturation increases the property slightly compared to fully saturated chains.
- **CCCCCC** (hexane) isn't in the examples, but simpler alkanes like **CCC(C)C** (isobutane) and **CC(C)CCO** (isobutanol) have values around **0.29434112** and **0.931488**, respectively, though these are shorter and branched.

Since **CCCCCCCC** is a longer, fully saturated, and non-polar alkane, its property value should be lower than **CCCCCCCO** but higher than very small alkanes. Based on the trend, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCC: ~-0.65**  

This aligns with the trend that longer, non-polar alkanes have lower (more negative) values compared to shorter or functionalized chains. For example:
- **C/C1CCCCC1\C** (a cyclohexane derivative) has **-0.7030919**, which is structurally more constrained but similarly non-polar.
- **CCCCCC1CCCC1** (a cyclic alkane) has **-0.63328328**, close to the predicted range.

Thus, **-0.65** is a plausible interpolation for octane.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 5.936480993398469
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, double bonds, carbonyl groups, hydroxyl groups, and other substituents. Higher values seem associated with molecules containing multiple rings, carbonyl groups, hydroxyl groups, and conjugated systems, while lower values are associated with simpler aliphatic structures or less polar functionalities.

Let's analyze the target molecule:  
**CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**

### Structural features:
1. **Multiple fused rings**: The molecule contains a complex steroid-like fused ring system (4 rings), which is associated with higher property values in the examples (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` has a value of 5.56194673).
2. **Carbonyl group (=O)**: Present in the structure, which often increases the property value (e.g., `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` has a value of 8.03615229).
3. **Hydroxyl groups (-OH)**: Two hydroxyl groups are present, which contribute to higher values (e.g., `OCC2OC(OC1(CO)OC(CO)C(O)C1O)C(O)C(O)C2O` has a value of 1.54826163).
4. **Alkyne group (C#C)**: This is a less common feature, but its presence may slightly increase the value due to additional unsaturation.
5. **Steroid-like backbone**: Similar to some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` at 5.56194673 and `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` at 8.03615229).

### Comparison with similar examples:
- The molecule is most similar to steroid-like structures with carbonyl and hydroxyl groups, which have values in the range of **5.5 to 9.5**.
- The presence of an alkyne might slightly increase the value compared to purely saturated or carbonyl/hydroxyl-containing steroids.

### Predicted value:
Given the structural complexity, the presence of two hydroxyl groups, a carbonyl group, and an alkyne, the predicted property value is likely in the **higher end of the steroid-like examples**.  

**Predicted value: ~8.5**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the examples. If the property is something like "logP" or "polar surface area," the reasoning would differ.)  

**Final answer: 8.5** (approximate, based on structural similarity to high-valued examples).  

(If you can clarify the property being predicted, I can refine this further!)

Given the complexity and size of the molecule **COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67**, we can analyze its structural features to predict the property value based on the provided examples. Here's the reasoning:

### **Key Structural Observations:**
1. **Polycyclic and Heterocyclic Components**: The molecule contains multiple fused rings (e.g., benzene, furan-like O-heterocycles, and sugar-like moieties).  
   - Example: **c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45** (polycyclic) → **1.418**  
   - Example: **C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21** (large polycyclic) → **21.388**  

2. **Oxygen-Rich Functional Groups**:  
   - Multiple ether (**OCH3**, **OC**), hydroxyl (**OH**), and carbonyl (**C=O**) groups.  
   - Example: **COP(=O)(OC)OC(Br)C(Cl)(Cl)Br** (P=O, ethers) → **1.124**  
   - Example: **C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21** (many O-groups) → **21.388**  

3. **Glycosidic and Sugar-Like Motifs**:  
   - The presence of **OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O** resembles carbohydrate structures, which often contribute to higher property values due to their complexity and polarity.  

4. **Aromatic and Conjugated Systems**:  
   - Benzene and furan-like rings contribute to conjugation, but the oxygen substitution reduces hydrophobicity compared to pure hydrocarbons.  

### **Comparison with Given Examples:**
- The molecule is most similar to **C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21** (steroid-like, many O-groups, large size → **21.388**).  
- However, it is slightly less bulky and has more oxygenated fragments, which may slightly reduce the value compared to steroids but still keep it high.  

### **Predicted Property Value:**
Given the structural similarity to large, oxygen-rich polycyclic systems, the predicted property value is:  

**~15.5**  

*(This is an estimate based on the trend that large, oxygenated polycyclic structures in the dataset yield high values, but not as extreme as the steroid example.)*

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 0.04275566283180693
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities in the structures and their corresponding property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (4-nitrophenol): Property value = **0.02727993**
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (2-nitrophenol, same SMILES but likely ortho): Property value = **0.021468**
   - Phenol itself (not explicitly given, but substituted phenols are present) tends to have property values close to zero when substituted with moderately polar groups (e.g., nitro).

2. **Chlorinated Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (4-chloroiodobenzene): Property value = **-0.65792107**
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl): Property value = **-0.58736682**
   - Chlorine substituents on aromatic rings tend to pull the property value into the negative range, but the exact value depends on other substituents.

3. **Combined Substituents (OH and Cl)**:
   - The molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** has both an electron-donating hydroxyl group (-OH) and an electron-withdrawing chlorine (-Cl) on the aromatic ring. The interplay of these substituents will likely result in a property value between the nitrophenol examples (slightly positive) and the chlorinated aromatics (more negative).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Nitrophenols (with strong electron-withdrawing -NO2) have property values ~0.02 to 0.03.
- Chlorinated aromatics (with -Cl) have property values ~-0.6 to -0.7.
- The hydroxyl group is less electron-withdrawing than -NO2 but more electron-donating, while -Cl is moderately electron-withdrawing.

The property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is likely slightly negative but closer to zero than the purely chlorinated aromatics. 

### Estimated Property Value:
**-0.15**

### Rationale:
- The hydroxyl group will partially counteract the electron-withdrawing effect of chlorine, bringing the value closer to zero than, say, **Clc1ccccc1I** (-0.657).
- It is less negative than chlorinated biphenyls or heavily chlorinated aromatics but more negative than nitrophenols.

Thus, the predicted property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is approximately **-0.15**. 

(Note: This is an educated estimate based on the given examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -0.41835077373142376
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - **Chlorine atoms (Cl)**: Present at the alkyne terminal (ClCC#) and on the aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1). From the examples, Cl substituents can contribute positively or negatively depending on context (e.g., Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)... has a value of 2.27, while ClC1C(Cl)...C1Cl has 0.06).
   - **Alkyne (C#C)**: Rare in the examples, but alkynes are generally hydrophobic and may lower the property value slightly.
   - **Ester-like linkage (OC(=O)N)**: Similar to amides/carbamates. Examples with C(=O)N or C(=O)O (e.g., COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC has -0.74) tend to have negative values.
   - **Aromatic ring with Cl substituent**: Similar to Clc1cccc(Cl)c1, which might align with moderately negative values (e.g., Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has -0.72).

2. **Polarity and Size**:
   - The molecule is moderately sized with polar groups (Cl, C=O, N) but also has hydrophobic regions (aromatic ring, alkyne). This balance suggests a value in the low-to-moderate range.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl**: Multiple Cl atoms, value = 1.41.
   - **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**: Complex with Cl/F, value = 0.73.
   - **CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1**: Ether + amide, value = -0.77.
   - **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1**: Aromatic + Cl, value = -0.72.

Given the presence of two Cl atoms, an alkyne, and a polar carbamate (OC(=O)N), the molecule likely has a **moderately negative value**, similar to other Cl-containing aromatics with polar groups.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.55**  
*(This estimate balances the negative contribution of the polar carbamate and Cl substituents with the alkyne's hydrophobicity, aligning with examples like Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (-0.72) and CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1 (-0.77).)*

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 2.1049457756486563
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, presence of halogens (Cl, Br), aromatic systems, and functional groups like alcohols, amines, and carbonyls.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a central carbon attached to:
   - A hydroxyl group (**OH**), which is polar and can form hydrogen bonds.
   - A chlorinated phenyl ring (**c1ccc(Cl)cc1**), which adds lipophilicity and electron-withdrawing effects.
   - A pyrimidine-like heterocycle (**c2cncnc2**), which is aromatic and polar due to nitrogen atoms.
   - Another chlorinated phenyl ring (**c3ccccc3Cl**), contributing similar effects as the first one.

2. **Key Features**:
   - Two aromatic rings (both with Cl substituents).
   - A polar heterocycle (pyrimidine-like).
   - A hydroxyl group (polar, H-bond donor).
   - Multiple Cl atoms (electron-withdrawing, lipophilic).

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with **multiple Cl atoms** and aromatic systems tend to have property values in the range of **0.5 to 2.0** (e.g., ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl: -0.487, Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc2Cl: 1.403).
- Molecules with **polar groups (OH, N-heterocycles)** and aromaticity often fall in the **0.5 to 1.5** range (e.g., Nc1nc[nH]n1: 1.503, O=C1N(COC(=O)C)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3: 2.242).
- The presence of **two Cl-substituted phenyl rings** is similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (property: 2.062), but our molecule has additional polar features (OH and N-heterocycle).

### Prediction:
Given the combination of:
- Two Cl-substituted phenyl rings (lipophilic, electron-withdrawing).
- A polar heterocycle (pyrimidine-like, aromatic N).
- A hydroxyl group (polar, H-bonding).

The property value is likely in the **1.5 to 2.5 range**, leaning toward the higher end due to the polar heterocycle and hydroxyl group. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 1.85**  

This aligns with similar molecules in the examples while accounting for the additional polar features.

Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 0.19763282856547001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - Molecules with **aliphatic esters (e.g., CCOC=O)** tend to have moderately negative values (e.g., **CC(=O)OCC**, -0.262).
   - **Aldehydes (e.g., CCCCC=O)** have slightly negative values (-0.170).
   - Formate esters (like **CCCCOC=O**) are structurally similar to these examples.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCBr**, -0.359) tend to have more negative values than shorter ones.
   - The presence of an **ether linkage (O)** in **CCCCOC=O** may slightly increase the value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate): -0.262
   - **CCCC=O** (pentanal): -0.170
   - **CCCCOC=O** is intermediate in structure between these two, with an ether linkage and a formyl group.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate, -0.262) but with a slightly longer chain and a formyl group instead of an acetyl group, the property value for **CCCCOC=O** is expected to be **slightly more negative** than -0.262 but less negative than pure hydrocarbons like **CCCCBr** (-0.359).

### Final Prediction:
**-0.30** (estimated based on interpolation from similar examples). 

This is a reasonable estimate given the data, though the exact value would depend on finer structural details or additional examples.

Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1.3464812526401042
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the given molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) in the context of the provided data.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Alkanes**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of **0.62709419**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene) has a property value of **-0.7596985**.
   - **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(NC=O)...** (a heavily chlorinated compound) has a property value of **3.00823551**.

2. **Small Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - **ClCCCl** is a small, symmetric dichlorinated alkane with a positive property value (0.627).
   - **ClCCl** is even smaller and symmetric (dichloromethane), so we might expect a similar or slightly higher value due to reduced size and increased symmetry.

3. **Other Small Molecules**:
   - **CNN** (a small, polar molecule) has a high value of **2.83865538**.
   - **CCCC** (butane) has a value of **0.8819795**, showing that small alkanes can have positive values.

### Prediction for ClCCl:
- **ClCCl** is smaller and more symmetric than **ClCCCl**, which has a value of **0.62709419**.
- It has two chlorines (like **ClCCCl**), but no additional carbons, which may slightly increase the property value due to higher polarity and compactness.
- No other small dichlorinated methanes are in the dataset, but **ClCCCl** is the closest analog.

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for **ClCCl** would be slightly higher than **ClCCCl**, perhaps in the range of **0.7 to 1.0**. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for ClCCl: 0.85** (a conservative estimate, balancing symmetry and size effects). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data.)

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.2643937816508541
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Hydroxyl (-OH) Groups**:
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol): Property = **0.42242187**
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol): Property = **0.02727993**
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (methyl-substituted phenol): Property = **-0.72765843**
   - **c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC** (alkyl-substituted dihydroxybenzene): Property = **-0.47876051**

   Phenols with electron-donating groups (e.g., -OH, -CH3) tend to have property values in the range of **-0.7 to +0.4**, depending on substitution patterns.

2. **Methyl Substitution**:
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (two methyl groups + phenol): Property = **-0.72765843**
   - **Cc1ccc(C)cc1O** (one methyl group + phenol) is structurally similar but with fewer methyl groups, which may slightly increase the property value compared to the above.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - The molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (specifically, 2,4-dimethylphenol). 
   - It has two methyl groups (like **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O**, which is likely 2,6-dimethylphenol), but the substitution pattern is different (2,4 vs. 2,6). 
   - Ortho-substitution (2,6) tends to sterically hinder the -OH group more than meta-substitution (2,4), which may slightly increase the property value for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**.

### Prediction:
Given the above trends, the property for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** (2,4-dimethylphenol) is likely **higher** than **-0.72765843** (the value for 2,6-dimethylphenol) but lower than simple phenol derivatives like **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (0.42242187). 

A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **-0.4 to -0.2**. 

### Final Predicted Value:
**-0.35** (a compromise between the steric and electronic effects of the methyl groups and the -OH group). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. If the property is something like logP or polarity, the reasoning would adjust accordingly.)

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.12626767121370838
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = 0.71899678  
     (Highly chlorinated biphenyl-like structure)
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl**: Property = 1.41333947  
     (Even more chlorinated biphenyl-like structure, higher value)
   - **Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl**: Property = -0.75477788  
     (Chlorinated phenol, but with an -OH group, which lowers the value compared to fully chlorinated aromatics)

2. **Structural Similarity**:
   - The molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** is a **chlorinated biphenyl** with 5 chlorine atoms, similar to the second example above but with slightly fewer chlorines (the second example has 7 chlorines and a property of 1.41333947). 

3. **Trend**:
   - More chlorines on aromatic rings tend to increase the property value, especially in biphenyl-like structures. 
   - The presence of polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2) can reduce the property value.

### Prediction:
The given molecule is a **tetrachlorinated biphenyl** (4 chlorines on one ring, 1 on the other, totaling 5 chlorines). Comparing to the examples:
- The 7-chlorinated biphenyl has a value of 1.41333947.
- The 5-chlorinated biphenyl would likely have a slightly lower value but still higher than the 4-chlorinated biphenyl (0.71899678).

Given the trend, a reasonable estimate would be between **0.9 and 1.2**. Splitting the difference, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 1.1** (approximate, likely in the range of 1.0 to 1.2). 

For specificity, let's say **1.05**. 

However, looking back at the examples, the jump from 4 chlorines (0.718) to 7 chlorines (1.413) is roughly linear per chlorine (~0.23 per chlorine). For 5 chlorines, this would suggest:  
0.718 + (0.23) = **0.95**. 

Given the uncertainty, I'll refine the prediction to:  
**Predicted property value: 1.0** (rounded). 

But the second example (7 chlorines) is 1.413, so 5 chlorines might be closer to 1.0. 

Final answer: **1.0**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the data.) 

---
**Answer: 1.0** (approximate). 

If more precision is needed, a closer look suggests the value could be **1.05**, but given the examples, **1.0** is a reasonable rounded estimate.

**Final predicted value: 1.0**.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.9502602112586261
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isobutylene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Branches**:
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): -0.74616049  
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane): -0.72960593  
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): -0.73008271  
   - **CC(=O)C** (methyl ethyl ketone): Not directly given, but simpler branched/unsaturated hydrocarbons tend to have values around **-0.7 to -0.5**.

2. **Unsaturation (Double Bonds)**:
   - **C=C** in **COC(=O)C=C**: 1.49205772 (but this also has an ester, which skews the value).  
   - **CC=C** in **CCCCC(CC)C=O**: -0.70177185 (this also has an aldehyde, but the unsaturated hydrocarbon part is similar to isobutylene).  

3. **Branched Unsaturated Hydrocarbons**:
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a branched alkene (isobutylene). From the examples, purely hydrocarbon structures (especially branched/unsaturated) tend to have property values close to **-0.7**.  

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Branched alkanes (e.g., **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**) are around **-0.73**.  
- Linear alkenes (e.g., **CCCCCCCCC=C**) are around **-0.746**.  
- **CC=C(C)C** is a branched alkene, so its value should be slightly higher (less negative) than linear alkenes but similar to branched alkanes.  

Thus, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value for CC=C(C)C: -0.71**  

### Final Answer:
**-0.71**
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1.3464812526401042
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values vary based on molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features. Let's analyze the given molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) in the context of the examples:

1. **Simple Chlorinated Alkanes**: 
   - **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (tetrachloroethylene) has a property value of **0.14412419**.
   - **Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobenzene derivative) has a much higher value of **3.26565196**, likely due to its aromaticity and multiple chlorines.
   - **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl** (a complex polycyclic chlorinated hydrocarbon) has a value of **4.22635588**.

2. **Dichloromethane (ClCCl)**:
   - This is a very simple molecule with only two chlorines and no aromaticity or complex branching.
   - Compared to **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (0.14412419), which has more chlorines and a double bond, **ClCCl** would likely have a lower value due to its simplicity.
   - The presence of chlorines tends to increase the property value slightly compared to non-halogenated simple alkanes (e.g., **CC(C)C** has -0.41577518), but not as much as in highly chlorinated or aromatic systems.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Given that **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** is 0.14412419 and **ClCCl** is simpler, I would estimate its value to be slightly lower but still positive due to the chlorines.
   - A reasonable guess would be in the range of **0.05 to 0.10**.

**Final predicted property value for ClCCl: 0.08** (approximate, based on the trend observed in the examples). 

This is a rough estimate, as the exact property being predicted is not explicitly defined (e.g., logP, polarizability, etc.), but the trend suggests simple chlorinated molecules have small positive values.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.6285113945284341
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values when combined with other functional groups (e.g., **OC1C=CC2C1C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl** has a value of **1.725**).
   - However, simple polychlorinated aromatics like **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** (bromine analog) and **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** have negative values (**-0.715** and **-0.626**, respectively).

2. **Phenol (OH) + Chlorine**:
   - The molecule **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (trichlorophenol) has a property value of **-0.626**.
   - The new molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is also a trichlorophenol but with a slightly different substitution pattern (1,2,4-trichlorophenol vs. 2,4,6-trichlorophenol in the example).

3. **Substitution Pattern**:
   - The property value seems sensitive to the position of substituents. For example, symmetric substitution (2,4,6-) gives **-0.626**, while asymmetric (1,2,4-) might slightly alter the value.

4. **Other Functional Groups**:
   - The presence of **OH (phenol)** combined with **Cl** generally leads to negative values unless other complex features (e.g., fused rings, additional polar groups) are present.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (-0.626) but with a less symmetric substitution pattern, the property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is expected to be slightly higher (less negative) due to reduced symmetry and potential minor electronic effects. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**-0.55** (range: -0.60 to -0.50).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is **-0.55**.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 26.236017434602214
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse set of molecules and their associated property values, it appears that the property in question is likely related to **molecular weight** or a **logarithmic partition coefficient (logP)**, but the range of values suggests it might be something more complex, possibly **molar refractivity** or a **calculated molecular descriptor** (e.g., topological polar surface area, etc.). 

However, observing the examples:
- Small, nonpolar molecules (e.g., `C#C`, `CCCCl`) have values ranging from small positive to larger positive numbers.
- Large, complex molecules (e.g., steroids like `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO`) have very high values (e.g., 8.9).
- Polar or functionalized molecules (e.g., `O=C1CNC(=O)N1`) have intermediate values.
- Aromatic systems with substitutions (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl`) have small positive or negative values.

The molecule to predict is:
```
COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
```
This is a **highly complex, polycyclic, and heavily functionalized molecule** with multiple ethers, alcohols, a ketone, and fused rings. Given its size and polarity, it is most similar to the steroids or large cyclic systems in the examples, which have values in the **6–9 range**. 

### Breakdown:
1. **Size**: The molecule is very large (comparable to `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO`, which has a value of 8.9).
2. **Polarity**: It has many polar groups (ethers, alcohols, ketone), which may reduce the value slightly compared to purely hydrophobic systems.
3. **Structural similarity**: The presence of multiple fused rings and oxygenated groups aligns with high values in the examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted value is likely in the **7.5–8.5 range**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**≈ 8.2**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data. If the property is something else, the prediction may differ.)

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.385562658875162
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** (with S and N atoms) fused to a **pyrimidine-like ring** (with N and C=O groups). This is a heterocyclic system with polar and hydrogen-bonding capabilities.
2. **Substituents**:
   - **Methylthio group (S-CH3)**: Moderately hydrophobic but with some polarity due to the sulfur.
   - **Tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)**: Highly hydrophobic and bulky.
   - **Amide (C=O and NH)**: Polar and capable of hydrogen bonding.
3. **Overall Polarity**: The molecule has both polar (amide, N, S) and nonpolar (tert-butyl) regions, suggesting intermediate polarity.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Similar to heterocyclic/polar examples**:
  - **Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1** (property = 0.1445659): Contains a polar heterocycle with amide and NH groups.
  - **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property = 0.33444052): Contains a polar heterocycle with amide, N, and S, plus a tert-butyl group (very similar to our molecule).
- **Other polar/nonpolar hybrids**:
  - **COc1ccccc1** (property = 0.13863999): Simple aromatic with polar methoxy group.
  - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (property = -0.12081424): Aromatic with polar amide and hydroxyl.

### Key Observations:
1. The presence of the **tert-butyl group** tends to increase the property value slightly (as seen in **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** = 0.33444052).
2. The **thioether (S-CH3)** and **amide (C=O, NH)** groups add polarity but are balanced by the hydrophobic tert-butyl group.
3. The property values for similar heterocyclic/polar molecules range from **-0.2 to +0.5**, with tert-butyl pushing it toward the higher end.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property = 0.33444052), but with slightly less polarity (no OH group), the predicted property value for **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C** would be slightly lower but still positive.

**Predicted property value: 0.25** (approximate, likely between 0.2 and 0.3). 

### Exact Prediction:
After closer comparison, the closest analog is **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property = 0.33444052). Our molecule lacks the OH group but retains the tert-butyl and thioether, so the value should be slightly lower. 

**Final predicted property value: 0.28**.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6201101303617748
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) tend to have negative property values unless other functional groups dominate. For example:
     - `o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` (polycyclic aromatic): -0.765  
     - `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (diphenyl ether): -0.766  
     - `c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12` (brominated aromatic): -0.766  
   - The presence of an aromatic ring (`c1ccccc1`) in **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** suggests a negative contribution.

2. **Ester Group (`COO`)**: 
   - Esters (e.g., `CCOC(=O)`) appear in several molecules with moderately negative values:
     - `COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C`: 0.578 (note: this has additional complex substituents)  
     - `CCCC(=O)OCC`: -0.575  
     - `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2`: 6.795 (this is an outlier due to the sulfonamide and other groups).  
   - The ester group alone (without strongly polar or charged groups) seems to contribute slightly negatively.

3. **Ethyl Group (`CCO`)**: 
   - Ethyl groups (e.g., `CCO`) are neutral or slightly negative unless paired with highly polar groups. For example:
     - `CCC(C)(C)CO`: -0.064  
     - `CCC(C)CO`: 0.252 (smaller alkyl chain).  

4. **Combined Features in CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**:
   - The molecule is **ethyl benzoate**, consisting of:
     - A benzene ring (aromatic, negative contribution).  
     - An ester group (moderately negative).  
     - No strongly polar or charged groups to offset the negative trend.  

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl butyrate): -0.575  
- `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (diphenyl ether): -0.766  
- `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (aromatic diketone): -0.754  

Given these observations, **ethyl benzoate (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1)** is expected to have a property value **between -0.5 and -0.8**, closer to the aromatic-dominated examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.65** (estimated based on the average of similar aromatic + ester-containing molecules).  

*Note*: This is an educated guess based on the provided examples, as the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.) is not specified. The value aligns with the trend of aromatic + ester groups yielding moderately negative values in the dataset.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.7334310058461448
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkyl Halides (e.g., C-Br, C-Cl):**
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: Property = -0.30308148  
     (Polychlorinated biphenyl, moderately negative value)
   - **CI**: Property = 0.12579247  
     (Iodomethane, small positive value)
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1**: Property = -0.76588043  
     (Bromonaphthalene, moderately negative value)
   - **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**: Property = -0.45336506  
     (Brominated heterocycle, moderately negative value)

   Halogens (Cl, Br, I) tend to contribute to negative property values, but the magnitude depends on the rest of the structure. Simple alkyl halides like **CI** have small positive values, while larger/bulkier halogenated molecules tend to have more negative values.

2. **Alkyl Chains:**
   - **CCCC (=O)CCC**: Property = -0.50311264  
     (Ketone with alkyl chain, moderately negative)
   - **CCCCC (=O)CCCC**: Property = -0.76509321  
     (Longer alkyl chain ketone, more negative)
   - **CCCCCCCO**: Property = -0.60231999  
     (Alcohol with long alkyl chain, moderately negative)
   - **CCCCCCC=C**: Property = -0.60243886  
     (Alkene with long alkyl chain, similar to alcohol)

   Longer alkyl chains tend to correlate with more negative property values, especially when combined with polar groups (e.g., C=O, OH). Pure hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCCCCC=C**) also have moderately negative values.

3. **Brominated Alkyl Chains:**
   - **CCCCCCCBr** is a simple linear alkyl bromide (1-bromoheptane). It has:
     - A long alkyl chain (7 carbons), which would typically contribute a moderately negative value (similar to **CCCCCCCO** or **CCCCCCC=C**).
     - A bromine atom, which (based on **CI** and **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1**) could contribute a small positive or moderately negative value depending on the context.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Long alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCO**, **CCCCCCC=C**) have property values around **-0.60**.
- Simple halogenated alkanes (e.g., **CI**) have small positive values, but larger/bulkier brominated molecules (e.g., **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1**) have more negative values.
- **CCCCCCCBr** is intermediate: the bromine is not as bulky as in aromatic systems, but the long alkyl chain pushes the value toward the negative side.

A reasonable estimate is slightly more negative than **CCCCCCCO (-0.60231999)** but less negative than **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (-0.76588043)**. 

### Final Prediction:
The property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is approximately **-0.65**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples. For precise predictions, computational methods or experimental data would be needed.)
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 3.5817370787527794
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property value for **CO (methanol)**:

1. **Simple alcohols**: Molecules like `CCC(C)CO` (2-methyl-1-butanol) have a property value of **0.25201304**, and `OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O` (a sugar-like polyol) has a value of **-0.60500477**. Methanol (`CO`) is simpler than these but still polar due to the -OH group.
2. **Small polar molecules**: `CCCCOC=O` (butyl formate) has a value of **0.19763283**, and `COC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1` (methyl salicylate) has **-0.36954512**. Methanol is smaller and less complex but similarly polar.
3. **Trend for -OH groups**: `OC1CCCCCC1` (cycloheptanol) has **-0.62424856**, but methanol lacks the hydrophobic ring, so its value should be less negative.

Given these observations, methanol (`CO`) is a small, highly polar molecule with no significant hydrophobic contributions. Its property value is likely **close to 0 but slightly positive**, similar to other small polar molecules in the dataset.

### Predicted property value for **CO**:  
**~0.15** (estimated based on trends in the data).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)*
