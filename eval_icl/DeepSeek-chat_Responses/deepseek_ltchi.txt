SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 468.3691482210056
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values tend to increase with the size and complexity of the molecule, especially when functional groups like carbonyls (C=O), esters (COOR), or aromatic rings are present. 

The molecule in question is **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**, which is a linear alkyl chain (10 carbons) with an ester group (COOCH3) at the end. 

Comparing this to similar molecules in the dataset:
- **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (10-carbon ester) vs. **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (12-carbon ester, property = 889.28873773): The 12-carbon ester has a higher property value, but the trend suggests that longer alkyl chains with polar groups (like esters) contribute positively to the property.
- **CCCC(C)O** (property = -763.34786219) and **CCCCCC(C)O** (property = -131.96847793) show that even simple alcohols with longer chains have less negative (or more positive) values.
- **CCCCCCCC(C)O** (property = 78.49131683) is a longer-chain alcohol with a positive value, indicating that size and functional groups matter.

Given that **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** is a 10-carbon ester (smaller than the 12-carbon ester but larger than many other examples), and esters tend to have higher property values than simple alkanes or alcohols, a reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than the 12-carbon ester but still significantly positive. 

**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC: ~750.0**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. For precise predictions, computational methods or more extensive training data would be needed.)

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -356.55063576705464
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a benzofuran-like structure with a lactam (cyclic amide) fused to a benzene ring. Specifically:
   - A benzene ring with a chlorine substituent (Cl).
   - A fused 5-membered ring containing an oxygen (O) and a lactam (C=O and NH).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Chloro-substituted benzene (Clc2ccc...).
   - Lactam (oc(=O)[nH]).
   - Fused heterocyclic system (benzofuran-like with N and O).

### Comparison with Given Examples:
- **Chlorinated Aromatics**: 
  - Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (730.47) and Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (123.71) show that chlorination increases the property value, but multiple chlorines have varying effects.
- **Lactams/Amides**: 
  - O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC (585.07) and O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1 (-1011.07) show that cyclic amides can have widely varying values depending on substitution.
- **Fused Heterocycles**: 
  - Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (-354.79) and Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C (160.62) suggest that fused rings with electronegative atoms can have moderate positive or negative values.

### Key Observations:
- The presence of a chlorine on the benzene ring tends to increase the value (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl is 730.47).
- The lactam (oc(=O)[nH]) is similar to cyclic amides in the examples, which can range from highly negative (-1011.07) to moderately positive (585.07), but here it is part of a fused system.
- The fused benzofuran-like structure with N and O is somewhat unique in the examples, but similar to Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C (160.62), which has a fused ring with N and Cl.

### Prediction:
Given the chlorine substituent and the fused lactam structure, the property value is likely to be in the low-to-moderate positive range. Comparing to similar molecules:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (730.47) is higher due to multiple chlorines.
- Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C (160.62) is a closer match due to the fused N/O system and Cl.

Thus, the predicted property value for **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2** is approximately **200.0**. 

### Final Answer:
**200.0** (estimated based on structural similarity to given examples).

Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -1046.566314842155
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with the molecular structure, including functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular complexity. 

The molecule in question is **CC(C)N(=O)=O**, which is **isopropyl nitrite** or a nitro compound with a tertiary carbon (tert-butyl nitrite would be similar but with an additional methyl group). 

From the examples:
- Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) appear in molecules like `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` with a property value of **-347.47893379**.
- Simple aliphatic nitro compounds (e.g., `CCCOCC` with no nitro group) have negative values (e.g., **-746.23343964**), but nitro groups seem to increase the property value (make it less negative).
- The molecule `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` has a nitro-like group and a value of **915.77754059**, but it is more complex.

Given that `CC(C)N(=O)=O` is a relatively simple nitroalkane, but not as simple as `CCCOCC`, and considering the nitro group's effect, a reasonable estimate would be between **-300 and -400**. 

Looking at `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` (-347.47893379), which has a nitro group and some complexity, `CC(C)N(=O)=O` is simpler but still has the nitro group. Thus, a plausible prediction is:

**Predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O: -320.0**  

(This is an educated guess based on the trend; the actual value may vary slightly.)

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 2357.594797278652
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values appear to correspond to molecular energies (likely calculated at a certain level of theory, such as DFT or semi-empirical methods). The values range widely based on molecular size, functional groups, and complexity.

The molecule in question is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, hydroxyl groups, and a carbonyl group:

**CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**

### Observations:
1. The molecule is large and polycyclic, similar to some of the higher-energy examples (e.g., `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` with a value of **2247.60287677**).
2. It contains polar groups (OH, C=O) and has significant rigidity due to the fused ring system.
3. Compared to simpler molecules, this will have a much higher (more positive) energy value.

### Closest Analogues:
- `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` (2247.60287677): This is a steroid-like molecule with carbonyl groups and fused rings, very similar in complexity.
- `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (2204.02421507): Another large, rigid polycyclic system.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to the steroid-like example with a value of **2247.60287677**, and accounting for the additional polar groups (OH, C(=O)CO) which may slightly increase the energy, the predicted value should be in the same range but slightly higher due to the extra functionalization.

**Predicted property value: ~2300.0**  
(Exact prediction: **2300.5**)  

This is an estimate based on the trend observed in the examples. For a precise value, computational chemistry tools would be required.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 801.479380973629
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substitutions and one with a chlorine substitution), similar to many examples provided (e.g., `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1`, `CN(C)c1ccccc1`).
2. **Substituents**:
   - Two fluorine atoms on one ring (similar to `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` with a value of -646.86843358).
   - A chlorine atom on the other ring (similar to `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` with a value of -551.05437608).
3. **Amide Linkage**: The molecule has two amide groups (`C(=O)NC(=O)N`), which are polar and can influence the property. Examples with amide-like groups (e.g., `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1`) have values around -401.00893903.
4. **Size and Complexity**: The molecule is larger and more complex than most examples, which typically increases the property value (e.g., larger molecules like `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` have high positive values).

### Comparison with Examples:
- The presence of halogens (F, Cl) tends to reduce the property value (negative contributions).
- The amide linkage may add some polarity but not drastically change the value.
- The molecule is larger than simple halogenated aromatics but smaller than very large alkanes or complex polycyclics.

### Estimated Property:
Given the balance of:
- Negative contributions from halogens (similar to `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` at -646.868 and `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` at -551.054).
- Moderate size and amide groups (no direct examples, but likely small positive or neutral effect).

A reasonable estimate is **between -500 and -300**. Given the additional complexity and amide groups, I predict:  
**Predicted property value: -412.34567890**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the data. For precise predictions, computational methods or more data would be needed.)

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -580.1297795600221
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl propyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - Molecules with ether groups tend to have moderate to high property values, but the exact value depends on other structural features (e.g., branching, size).
   - Example: `CCOC(=O)CC` has a value of **-757.54500267**, but this also includes an ester group, which complicates direct comparison.
   - Example: `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (a polyol ether) has a value of **-329.44566401**, suggesting that ethers with polar groups can have less negative values.

2. **Branching and Size**:
   - Branched alkanes or ethers often have more negative values than linear ones.
   - Example: `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (branched alcohol) has a value of **-473.24806633**.
   - Example: `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` (branched alkane) has a value of **-146.44895834**.
   - Linear ethers like `CCCCCO` (pentanol) have a value of **-732.86052306**, which is quite negative.

3. **Specific Comparison**:
   - The molecule `CCCOC(C)C` is a branched ether (isopropyl propyl ether). It is structurally similar to `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (branched alcohol) but with an ether linkage instead of a hydroxyl group.
   - Ethers are less polar than alcohols, so the property value might be less negative than the corresponding alcohol but more negative than a pure hydrocarbon.

4. **Estimated Value**:
   - Given that `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` is **-473.24806633** and `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` is **-146.44895834**, the ether `CCCOC(C)C` is likely somewhere between these two.
   - The presence of the ether oxygen adds some polarity but not as much as a hydroxyl group, so the value should be less negative than **-473.24806633** but more negative than **-146.44895834**.
   - A reasonable estimate would be around **-300 to -400**.

### Final Prediction:
Considering the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **CCCOC(C)C** is approximately **-350.0**. 

**Answer:**  
The predicted property value for `CCCOC(C)C` is **-350.0**.

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 430.9872247172209
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O** by analyzing structural features and trends in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogen Substitution (Br)**:  
   - Molecules with Br substitution tend to have moderately negative or positive values (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` has -108.16, while `CCCCCCCBr` has +139.50).  
   - The presence of Br here suggests a possible positive contribution, but not extremely high.

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:  
   - Molecules with multiple carbonyl groups (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` at -12.94) often have values in the mid-range.  
   - This molecule has two carbonyls, which may contribute moderately.

3. **Heterocyclic Structure (with N and O)**:  
   - Heterocycles with N and O (e.g., `Nc1nccs1` at -774.97 or `COc2cnc1cncnc1n2` at -377.77) often have negative values, but this depends on other substituents.  
   - Here, the heterocycle is substituted with Br and carbonyls, which may offset negativity.

4. **Alkyl Groups (CCC(C))**:  
   - Alkyl groups alone (e.g., `CCC(C)CC` at -613.01) tend to give negative values, but combined with polar groups, the effect is less predictable.

5. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:  
   - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (-108.16) has a Br and carbonyl but is simpler; this molecule is more complex, likely increasing the value.  
   - `CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1` (+111.75) has a similar N-heterocycle with Cl and alkyl groups, suggesting a positive value is plausible here.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of Br, two carbonyls, and an alkylated heterocycle, the property value is likely **positive but not extremely high**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: ~250 to 400**  

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**315.0**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural analogies in the dataset. For precise predictions, computational methods or a larger training set would be needed.)

Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -81.2632521679324
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, size, and functional groups. The molecule in question is **biphenyl** (`c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`), which consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond.

From the examples:
- Simple aromatic systems like `Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C` (methyl-substituted naphthalene-like structure) have a property value of `-13.62837615`.
- Larger conjugated systems like `Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34` (a polycyclic aromatic structure) have a higher value of `912.12480066`.

Biphenyl is larger and more conjugated than a single benzene ring but less complex than polycyclic systems like the one above. Interpolating from the examples:
- The value for `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` (a large polycyclic aromatic) is `1767.72471256`, while simpler fused rings like `C1CCc2ccccc2C1` (a benzene fused to a cyclohexane) have `-96.79945932`.

Given biphenyl's intermediate size and conjugation, a reasonable estimate would be **between 200 and 500**. Looking at the examples, a plausible value is **~400**. 

However, the exact value seems to follow a non-linear trend, and the closest analog is `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` (large polycyclic) vs. smaller systems. For biphenyl, a more precise estimate based on the given data is **approximately 450**.

But reviewing the examples again, the value for `Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34` (a polycyclic aromatic with 3 rings) is `912.12480066`, while biphenyl (2 rings) would likely be roughly half that. Thus, a refined prediction is **~450-500**.

**Final predicted property value for biphenyl (`c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`): 475.0** (interpolated from the examples). 

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends.)*

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -677.1073948839634
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, halogens, and heteroatoms. The property tends to increase with more complex structures (e.g., rings, multiple functional groups, halogens) and decrease for simpler, aliphatic structures.

For the molecule **CCCCS** (1-butanethiol), which is a simple linear aliphatic thiol:
- It lacks rings, halogens, or multiple functional groups.
- It is structurally similar to **CCCCCC(C)C** (property: -208.09120506) and **CCC1CCCCC1** (property: -139.98808124), which are simple alkanes or cycloalkanes with low or negative property values.
- The presence of sulfur (S) might slightly increase the property compared to pure hydrocarbons, but not drastically (e.g., **CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2**, which has multiple functional groups and a ring, has a high value of 450.08417282, while **CC(C)I**, a simple halogenated alkane, has -692.78220108).

Given its simplicity and the trend in the examples, the predicted property for **CCCCS** would likely be a **moderate negative value**, similar to other simple aliphatic compounds but slightly higher due to the sulfur atom. 

**Predicted property for CCCCS: ~ -300.0**  
*(This is an estimate based on the trend; the exact value would require a more rigorous model or experimental data.)*

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -435.22542697879464
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, I will analyze the given examples and identify structural and functional group trends that correlate with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Branches**:
   - **CCC(C)(C)C** (neopentane): -717.14943648
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): -146.44895834
   - **CCCC/C=C/C** (unsaturated hydrocarbon): -521.26250829
   - **CC/C=C\C** (another unsaturated hydrocarbon): -942.1820978
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ester): -547.08520792
   - **CC(=O)OCC(COC(=O)C)OC(=O)C** (ester with multiple polar groups): 37.82617061

   Hydrocarbons with more branching or unsaturation tend to have lower (more negative) property values, while polar groups (like esters) can increase the value.

2. **Alcohols (OH Group)**:
   - **CC(C)CC(C)O** (branched alcohol): -613.56697356
   - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (tertiary alcohol): -387.0361056
   - **CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O** (cyclic alcohol): 221.18528655

   The presence of an OH group tends to increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons, especially if the OH is on a less substituted carbon (primary/secondary alcohols have higher values than tertiary alcohols).

3. **Specific Structure of CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
   - This is a **primary alcohol (OH on a terminal carbon)** with a **branched hydrocarbon chain (neopentyl-like structure)**.
   - Comparing to similar molecules:
     - **CC(C)CC(C)O** (branched primary alcohol): -613.56697356
     - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (tertiary alcohol): -387.0361056
     - **CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O** (cyclic alcohol): 221.18528655

   The primary alcohol here is less branched than **CC(C)CC(C)O**, so the property value should be higher (less negative) than -613.56697356 but lower than the cyclic alcohol's value.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- The primary alcohol **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is less branched than **CC(C)CC(C)O**, so its value should be higher (less negative).
- It is not cyclic, so it won't reach as high as 221.18528655.
- A reasonable estimate is between **-400 and -200**.

Looking at the closest analog (**CCCC(C)(O)CC**, tertiary alcohol: -387.0361056), the primary alcohol here should have a higher value (less negative) because primary alcohols are less sterically hindered and more polarizable.

### Final Prediction:
**Property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO: -350.0**  
*(This is an educated estimate based on the trends in the given data.)*

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -189.01153844896226
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - **Benzene (c1ccccc1)**: Property = -953.14228584
   - **Naphthalene-like systems**: 
     - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12**: Property = -11.10998725
     - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1**: Property = 404.77282445
     - **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: Property = 524.38700138
   - Aromatic systems with more rings or substitutions tend to have higher (less negative) property values compared to benzene.

2. **Methyl Substitutions**:
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1C**: Property = -429.51118786
   - **Cc1ccc(C)cc1**: Property = -607.41273906
   - Methyl substitutions generally reduce the property value (make it more negative) compared to unsubstituted aromatics, but the effect depends on the position and number of substitutions.

3. **Structure of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**:
   - This is a **methyl-substituted naphthalene** (methyl group on one of the rings). 
   - Compare with:
     - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (methyl-substituted naphthalene): Property = -11.10998725
     - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (methyl-substituted anthracene/phenanthrene-like): Property = 404.77282445
   - The given molecule has one fewer ring than the anthracene-like example, so its property should be lower (more negative) than 404.77 but higher (less negative) than -11.11.

4. **Other Similar Examples**:
   - **c1ccccc1**: -953.14
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1C**: -429.51
   - **Cc1ccc(C)cc1**: -607.41
   - The naphthalene core increases the property significantly compared to benzene.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Naphthalene with one methyl substitution (Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12) has a property of -11.10998725,
- The molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is very similar (methyl-substituted naphthalene, but with the methyl on a different position), the property should be close to this value.

The slight difference in methyl position may not drastically change the property, so we can estimate it to be in the same range. 

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is approximately **-50.0**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., heat of formation, energy, or another molecular descriptor—this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the given data. The value is likely close to the methyl-naphthalene examples, which range from -11.11 to slightly more negative for less conjugated systems.) 

However, comparing more closely with **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (-11.11) and noting that the methyl group in **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is on a terminal ring (similar to the first example), the property is likely very similar. 

Thus, the most precise estimate based on the given data is:  
**Predicted property: -15.0** (slightly more negative than -11.11 due to minor structural differences). 

But given the data, the closest match is **-11.10998725**, so the prediction is likely in the range of **-10 to -20**. 

For a single definitive value, I would predict:  
**-12.5**. 

(Note: This is a heuristic estimate; exact prediction would require knowing the specific property and a larger training set.) 

However, reviewing the examples again, the naphthalene-like systems with methyl substitutions have properties around -11.11 to 404.77, and the simpler methyl-naphthalene is -11.11. Thus, the most reasonable prediction is:  

**Predicted property for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1: -11.1** (very close to the provided example of Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12). 

### Final Answer:  
**-11.1** (approximating the very similar example in the data).

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to estimate the property.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a cyclic imide group (**O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1**) similar to the example:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C**, which has a property value of **-202.88577786**.
   - The core imide structure is identical, but the substituents differ.

2. **Substituents**:
   - The given molecule has a **C(C)CCC** group and a **CC=C** group attached to the cyclic imide.
   - The example has a **CC=C** group and a **methyl (C)** group.
   - The **C(C)CCC** group is a branched alkyl chain (isopentyl-like), which is larger and more hydrophobic than a simple methyl group.

3. **Comparison with Other Examples**:
   - Larger alkyl groups (e.g., **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**) tend to increase the property value compared to smaller ones (e.g., **CC(C)C**).
   - The **CC=C** group is present in both the given molecule and the example, so its contribution is similar.

4. **Adjustment for Substituents**:
   - The example with the smaller substituent (**methyl + CC=C**) has a value of **-202.88577786**.
   - The given molecule has a larger substituent (**C(C)CCC + CC=C**), which would likely increase the property value (less negative or more positive) due to increased size and hydrophobicity.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the larger substituent, we can estimate that the property value will be higher (less negative) than the example. A reasonable prediction would be in the range of **-100 to 0**, considering the trends in the data.

#### Final Prediction:
**-150.0** (approximate, based on structural similarity and substituent effects). 

This is an educated guess, as the exact property is not explicitly defined in the examples, but the trend suggests a value less negative than **-202.88577786** but still negative due to the imide core. 

For higher precision, more examples with similar substituents would be needed.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -646.8684335835525
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and substituents. Here are some trends:

1. **Simple alkanes (e.g., CCCCC)**: Tend to have negative values (e.g., -778.79 for CCCCC).
2. **Aromatic rings (e.g., c1ccccc1)**: When unsubstituted or with simple substituents, the values are often negative or moderately positive.
3. **Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens, nitro, carbonyl)**: These can increase the property value, especially if multiple are present (e.g., Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a high value of 1137.59).
4. **Fluorinated compounds**: The presence of fluorine (especially CF3 or multiple F atoms) tends to increase the property value significantly due to high electronegativity and polarizability.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1**
- This is **benzotrifluoride (Ph-CF3)**, where a benzene ring is substituted with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3).
- The -CF3 group is strongly electron-withdrawing and polar, which likely increases the property value.
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (di-halogenated benzene) has a value of -256.08.
  - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (multiple Cl substituents) has a value of 727.95.
  - The -CF3 group is more polarizable and electron-withdrawing than Cl or I, so we expect a higher value than -256.08 but not as high as 727.95 (since there are fewer substituents).

### Prediction:
Given the strong effect of -CF3 and the aromatic ring, a reasonable estimate would be in the range of **200 to 400**. 

Looking at the examples:
- **CN2C(=C(O)c1ccccc1S2(=O)=O)C(=O)Nc3ccccn3** (complex heterocycle with multiple polar groups) has a value of 1617.19.
- **CC1CCCCC1NC(=O)Nc2ccccc2** (amide + aromatic) has a value of 890.76.
- **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is simpler but has a very polar -CF3 group, so a value around **300-400** seems plausible.

### Final Predicted Value:
**350.0** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., dipole moment, polarizability, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

Iteration: 14
SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -295.66190108851447
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values tend to be influenced by the molecular structure, including functional groups, ring systems, and overall polarity. The molecule in question is:

**OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**

This is a sugar-like molecule (a hexose derivative, likely a form of glucose or a similar carbohydrate) with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and an oxygen in the ring (pyranose or furanose structure). 

From the examples, we can note that:
1. Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`, which is sorbitol or a similar polyol) have a property value of **-329.44566401**.
2. The presence of additional oxygen atoms in the ring (as in this case) may slightly modify the property value compared to a linear polyol.

Given the structural similarity to `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` but with an additional ring oxygen and slightly more constrained geometry, we might expect the property value to be somewhat more negative (due to increased stability or reduced strain). 

A reasonable prediction for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** would be in the range of **-350 to -400**. 

For specificity, we can estimate:  
**Predicted property value: -375.0**  

This is based on interpolation from the given examples, particularly the polyol structure, adjusted for the cyclic nature of the molecule.

Iteration: 15
SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 2642.06661304481
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, carbonyl groups, halogens, and conjugated systems. The molecule in question is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural features:
1. **Multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)**: There are three carbonyl groups (two ketones and one ester), which generally increase the property value (e.g., compare CCCCC(=O)CCCC with 25.68 to CCC(=O)OC with -993.54; the latter is simpler but has an ester).
2. **Steroid-like polycyclic structure**: The molecule has a fused 4-ring system (steroid-like), similar to some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C with 2094.99 and CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C with 2547.22).
3. **Hydroxy groups (OH)**: Two hydroxy groups are present, which can moderately increase the value (e.g., OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO has -329.45, but this is outweighed by other features here).
4. **Conjugated double bond (=CC=O)**: The α,β-unsaturated ketone (C=CC=O) adds to the complexity.

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- The closest examples are the steroid-like structures:
  - **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C**: 2094.99 (fewer carbonyls, no ester).
  - **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: 2547.22 (similar but with an ester and one fewer hydroxy group).

This molecule has **more functional groups (3 C=O, 2 OH, ester)** than the first example but **one fewer C=O** than the second. The presence of the conjugated system and additional hydroxy groups likely places it between these two.

### Predicted value:
Given the above, the property value should be **~2300–2500**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 2380.0**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarity and trends in the data. For precise predictions, computational tools or QSAR models would be needed.)

Iteration: 16
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 2055.335671266737
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, halogens, and heteroatoms. The molecule in question is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, hydroxyl groups, and a ketone, which suggests a relatively high property value due to its complexity and functionalization.

Breaking it down:
- The molecule has four fused rings (steroid backbone), which increases complexity.
- It contains a hydroxyl group (`-OH`) and a ketone (`C=O`), both of which are polar and likely contribute positively to the property value.
- The size and rigidity of the structure also suggest a higher value compared to simpler molecules.

Looking at similar complex molecules in the examples:
- `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` has a property value of **1611.36569478**. This is a steroid-like molecule with fused rings and hydroxyl groups, similar to the query molecule.
- `OC(C1=CC2C5C(C1C2=C(c3ccccc3)c4ccccn4)C(=O)NC5=O)(c6ccccc6)c7ccccn7` has a very high value of **3702.04656986**, but it is far more complex with additional aromatic systems and heteroatoms.

The query molecule is less complex than the second example but comparable to the first. Given this, the predicted property value should be in the range of **1600–1700**.

### Predicted property value: **1660.0** (approximate, based on structural similarity to the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., energy, polarizability, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

Iteration: 17
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -273.67430340139845
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CC(=O)N)**: This is a polar group that can contribute to the property value. From the examples, molecules with amide groups (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` with a value of 594.717) tend to have positive or moderately high values.
   - **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: This is a strongly electron-withdrawing group. Examples like `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (-742.918) and `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (-520.235) show that nitro groups can lead to negative values, but when combined with other polar/electron-donating groups, the effect may be balanced or reversed.
   - **Aromatic ring (c1ccc(cc1))**: This provides stability but is neutral unless substituted with polar groups.

2. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` has an amide and nitro group, with a value of **573.699**.
   - `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has a nitro group and methoxy (electron-donating), with a value of **-520.235**.
   - The presence of the acetamide group (CC(=O)N) in our molecule is more polar/electron-withdrawing than a methoxy group, which may push the value toward the positive side, similar to the first example above.

3. **Combined Effect**:
   - The nitro group tends to decrease the value, but the acetamide group (especially in conjugation with the aromatic ring) may increase it. The net effect is likely a moderately positive value, similar to `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` (573.699) but possibly slightly lower due to the nitro group's stronger influence.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance between the acetamide and nitro groups, a reasonable estimate would be around **500 to 600**. Averaging the closest examples, I predict:

**Predicted value: 550.0** (rounded to one decimal place for simplicity). 

This aligns with the trend where amide + nitro combinations yield positive but not extremely high values. 

---
**Final Answer: 550.0**  
*(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the data. For precise predictions, computational methods or more data would be needed.)*

Iteration: 18
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 2801.529514480957
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse set of molecules and their corresponding property values, it appears that the property in question is likely related to a computed molecular property such as **heat of formation**, **molecular polarizability**, or **a quantum-chemical energy value** (e.g., DFT-computed energy). The values span a wide range, from highly negative to highly positive, with no obvious linear trend based on simple molecular features like size or functional groups alone.

### Observations from the Training Data:
1. **Aromatic systems** with substitutions (e.g., `c1ccccc1`, `Clc1cccc2ccccc12`) tend to have moderate values (e.g., -158.31, 325.86).
2. **Highly conjugated or polycyclic systems** (e.g., steroids like `CC34CC(=O)C1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4(=O)`) have very large positive values (1850.28, 2706.63).
3. **Small aliphatic molecules** (e.g., `CC#N`, `CCC#N`) have highly negative values (-1490.40, -1254.41).
4. **Phosphorus- or sulfur-containing compounds** (e.g., `CSSC`) have moderately negative values (-132.56).
5. **Chlorine substitutions** often lead to negative values (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` = -551.05), but some cases are positive (e.g., `Clc1cccc2ccccc12Cl` = 325.86).

### Target Molecule Analysis:
The molecule to predict is:  
**`CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12`**  
This is a **phosphorodithioate ester** linked to a **chlorinated benzofuran** (or similar heterocycle). Key features:
- **Phosphorodithioate group (`P(=S)(OCC)S`)**: Likely contributes a moderately negative or positive value (similar to `CSSC` but with phosphorus).
- **Chlorinated aromatic system (`cc(Cl)ccc`)**: Tends toward negative values (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` = -551.05).
- **Heterocycle (`n1c(=O)oc2`)**: Could add complexity, but no direct training examples.

### Prediction Strategy:
1. The molecule is larger than simple aliphatics but lacks the polycyclic complexity of the high-value steroids.
2. The presence of `P=S` and `S-C` bonds may contribute similarly to `CSSC` (-132.56), but the aromatic system and chlorine will pull the value downward.
3. The closest analog in the training set is likely `Clc1cccc2ccccc12` (-158.31) or `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (-551.05), but with additional contributions from the phosphorus and heterocycle.

### Final Prediction:
Given the size and functional groups, the value is likely **moderately negative but not as extreme as small aliphatics**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: `-450.0`**  

This balances:
- The negative contribution from the chlorinated aromatic (~-500 to -300).
- The phosphorus/sulfur contribution (~-100 to +100).
- The heterocycle's uncertainty (neutral to slightly negative).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on the training data trends. For precise predictions, the actual property being modeled and more examples would be needed.)

SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -881.6780710945781
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as branching, presence of halogens, aromaticity, and polar groups. 

The molecule in question is **CC(C)(C)CO**, which is a branched primary alcohol (tert-butanol derivative). Comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol) has a property value of **-1003.99922394**.
2. **CCCC(C)O** (a branched pentanol) has a property value of **-130.16611321**.
3. **CC(C)(C)O** (tert-butanol) is not explicitly listed, but **CC(C)CO** is close.

The molecule **CC(C)(C)CO** is more branched than **CC(C)CO** but less branched than some of the larger aliphatic alcohols in the dataset (e.g., **CCCCCCCC(C)O** with a positive value). Given the trend that increased branching and smaller size tend to decrease the property value (more negative), but the addition of a methylene group (**-CH2-**) seems to moderate this effect, I estimate the property for **CC(C)(C)CO** to be slightly less negative than **CC(C)CO** but still in the same range.

### Predicted property value for **CC(C)(C)CO**:  
**-850.0** (approximate, based on interpolation from similar structures).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., energy, solubility, etc.—this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)*

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -639.521081210457
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with the molecular complexity, functional groups, and aromaticity. The molecule in question is:

**O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**

This is a purine-like structure with two fused rings (imidazole and pyrimidine), multiple nitrogens, and a carbonyl group (C=O). It is highly aromatic and has hydrogen-bonding capabilities due to the NH groups.

Looking at similar molecules in the examples:
- **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (a similar heterocycle with carbonyl and NH) has a property value of **-866.28747276**.
- **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1** (another heterocycle with NH and carbonyl) has a property value of **-910.75716572**.
- **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (a fused heterocycle without NH but with methoxy) has a property value of **-373.53114458**.

The molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** is more similar to the first two, with multiple NH groups and a carbonyl. Given its aromaticity and hydrogen-bonding potential, its property value is likely in the same range but slightly less negative than **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1** due to the additional nitrogen and fused ring system.

### Predicted property value: **-850.0** (estimated based on structural similarity and trends in the given data).

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -1011.3102921632682
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate) by comparing its structural features to the molecules in the dataset and identifying trends.

### Observations from the dataset:
1. **Simple aliphatic compounds** (e.g., CCCCCC(C)O, CC(C)O, CCC(C)(C)C) tend to have **negative property values**, often in the range of -300 to -1200.
2. **Compounds with aromatic rings** (e.g., c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43, Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccccc13) tend to have **positive property values**, often in the hundreds or thousands.
3. **Compounds with polar or functional groups** (e.g., CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC, CCOC(C)C) can have either positive or negative values, but smaller aliphatic esters/ethers (like CCOC(C)C) tend to be negative.
4. **Halogenated compounds** (e.g., Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1, ClCCCCl) tend to have **negative property values**, likely due to increased molecular weight and electronegativity effects.

### Analysis of CC(C)OC=O:
- It is a **small aliphatic ester** (methyl acetate), structurally similar to **CCOC(C)C** (ethyl isopropyl ether), which has a property value of **-580.12977956**.
- It lacks aromaticity or heavy halogens, so it likely falls into the **negative range**.
- The presence of the **ester group (C=O)** might slightly increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons or ethers, but not enough to make it positive.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
1. **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): **-1200.26441756**
2. **CCOC(C)C** (ethyl isopropyl ether): **-580.12977956**
3. **CC(=O)O** (acetic acid, not in dataset but analogous): Likely very negative.
4. **CC(=O)OC** (methyl acetate, our molecule): Expected to be between -600 and -300.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **CCOC(C)C** (ethyl isopropyl ether) is **-580.12977956**,
- **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) is **-1200.26441756**,
- **CC(=O)O** would likely be more negative than **CC(C)O**,
- **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate) is an ester, which is less polar than an alcohol but more polar than an ether,

A reasonable estimate for **CC(C)OC=O** is **-450.0**.

### Final predicted property value:
**-450.0** (estimated based on structural similarity and trends in the dataset).

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 320.346291385225
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might help us estimate the value.

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Aromatic Rings (e.g., benzene derivatives):**
   - Simple benzene derivatives (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl`) have negative values around -600 to -700.
   - Substitution with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `Cl`, `Br`) tends to increase the value (less negative or positive).
   - Substitution with electron-donating groups (e.g., `OH`, `NH2`) tends to decrease the value (more negative).

2. **Amides and Ureas:**
   - Amides (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1`) have values around -100 to -700.
   - Ureas or similar structures (e.g., `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1`) have positive values (~74.6).

3. **Symmetry and Conjugation:**
   - Symmetrical or conjugated systems (e.g., `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2`) may have higher values due to stabilization.

4. **Specific Examples:**
   - `CN(C)C=Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1C` has a value of ~73.65 (similar to urea-like structures).
   - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` has a value of ~-741.33 (amide with aromatic ring).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. It is symmetrical and conjugated, which may stabilize the structure and increase the property value compared to simpler amides.

Given that:
- Simple amides are in the range of -100 to -700.
- Urea-like structures (e.g., `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1`) have positive values (~74.6).
- The phenyl groups add conjugation and may push the value higher.

### Prediction:
The molecule is a **diaryl urea**, which is more conjugated and stabilized than simple amides or aliphatic ureas. Based on the examples, we can estimate a **positive value** in the range of **50 to 150**. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: ~120.0**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given data. For precise predictions, computational methods or experimental measurements would be required.)

Iteration: 23
SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 146.21857899082661
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Molecules with fused aromatic rings (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) tend to have higher property values. For example:
     - `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (a large fused aromatic system) has a value of **820.65563616**.
     - `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (two connected benzene rings) has a value of **85.9317314**.
   - The presence of multiple aromatic rings increases the property value, likely due to increased conjugation or polarizability.

2. **Simple Aromatic Systems**:
   - Single benzene rings or smaller aromatic systems with simple substituents tend to have lower or negative values. For example:
     - `CNc1ccccc1` has a value of **-675.04761507**.
     - `Sc1ccccc1` has a value of **-708.37586264**.

3. **Fused Aromatic Rings**:
   - The molecule `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` is **fluorene**, which consists of two benzene rings fused to a central five-membered ring. This is a smaller fused system compared to larger polycyclic aromatics but larger than simple benzene derivatives.

### Comparison to Given Examples:
- The molecule `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a value of **820.65563616**.
- The molecule `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (two connected benzene rings) has a value of **85.9317314**.
- The molecule `c1c(OC)c(OC)C2C(=O)OCC2c1` (a fused aromatic system with substituents) has a value of **76.40261285**.

### Prediction:
The molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (fluorene) is a fused aromatic system with three rings (two benzene rings fused to a five-membered ring). It is larger than simple benzene derivatives but smaller than large polycyclic aromatics. Based on the examples:
- It should have a higher value than `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (85.93) but lower than `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (820.66).
- A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **300-600**.

Given the compactness of the fluorene structure and its intermediate size, I predict a value of approximately **450.0**.

### Final Answer:
**450.0** (predicted property value for `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13`).

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 361.5842025315878
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogens, and heteroatoms (N, O, S, etc.). The property appears to increase with larger, more complex structures (e.g., polycyclic aromatics, long aliphatic chains) and certain functional groups (e.g., sulfonyl, nitro, carbonyl), while simpler or highly halogenated molecules tend to have lower or negative values.

Let's analyze the target molecule:  
**NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**  

### Structural features:
1. **Sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N)**: This is a polar and electron-withdrawing group, which in the examples tends to contribute positively to the property (e.g., molecules with sulfonyl groups like `CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O` have high values).
2. **Guanidine-like moiety (NC(=N)N)**: This is a highly polar and basic group, which may contribute to the property value.
3. **Aromatic ring with an amine (c1ccc(N)cc1)**: Aromaticity and additional nitrogen substitution tend to increase the property value (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3c2ccc4c5ccccc5ccc43` has a very high value due to polycyclic aromaticity).
4. **Overall molecular size**: The molecule is medium-sized, not as large as some high-value examples but more complex than low-value ones.

### Comparison with similar examples:
- `O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12` (property: -433.05) has a similar size but lacks sulfonyl or additional nitrogen groups, resulting in a negative value.
- `O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O` (property: 164.44) has multiple nitrogens and a nitro group, leading to a positive value.
- `CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O` (property: 1121.73) has a sulfonamide and aromatic system, resulting in a high value.

### Prediction:
The target molecule has a sulfonamide, a guanidine-like group, and an aromatic amine, all of which should contribute positively. However, it is not as large as some of the highest-value examples. Given the trends, I estimate the property value to be in the **mid-to-high positive range**, similar to molecules with sulfonamide and aromatic nitrogen groups.

**Predicted property value: ~650.0**  
*(This is an educated guess based on the examples, likely between 500 and 800.)*  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molecular weight, boiling point, or a computed chemical descriptor—this is a rough interpolation from the given data.)*

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 907.0838399621643
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values are influenced by molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromatic rings, halogen substitutions, nitro groups, and branching. 

The molecule in question is:  
**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic ring** with two **nitro groups (N(=O)=O)** (strongly electron-withdrawing, likely increasing the property value).  
2. **Trifluoromethyl (C(F)(F)F)** substitution (highly electronegative, likely increasing the property value).  
3. **Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C)** with an **alkene (C=C)** branch (moderate influence).  
4. Overall **highly substituted and polar structure**, similar to some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O → 1075.1).  

### Comparison to similar examples:
- **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O** (1075.1): Contains nitro groups, aromatic systems, and polar substitutions.  
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1** (838.25): Less polar but still has nitro-like contributions.  
- **CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23** (870.95): Similar amine + aromatic + polar group influence.  

Given the **two nitro groups + trifluoromethyl group + extended conjugation**, this molecule is likely **more polarizable and higher in property value** than most examples but not as extreme as very large steroids or long alkanes.  

### Predicted property value:  
**~1250.0** (estimated between 1075.1 and the next tier of large polar molecules).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured—e.g., molar refractivity, heat of formation, etc.—this is an empirical extrapolation from the given data.)  

**Final answer: 1250.0** (rounded to reasonable precision based on trends).

Iteration: 26
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -1011.3102921632682
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including functional groups, branching, and the presence of heteroatoms (e.g., O, N, Cl, Br, S). 

The molecule in question is **CC(C)OC=O**, which is an ester with the structure: isopropyl formate (or methyl acetate-like structure with an isopropyl group). Breaking it down:
1. It has an ester group (**OC=O**), which is polar and contributes to the property value.
2. It has a branched alkyl group (**CC(C)**), which typically reduces the property value compared to linear chains (as seen in examples like CCCCCC(C)O vs. CCCCCCCCO).
3. No heteroatoms beyond the ester oxygen are present.

Comparing to similar molecules in the examples:
- **CC(=O)N** (acetamide) has a property value of -1377.09279953, but it includes a highly polar amide group.
- **CC(=O)O** (acetic acid) is not in the examples, but esters like **CCOC(=O)C** (ethyl acetate) have a value of -362.15846777.
- **CC(C)CCOC=O** (branched ester) has a value of -606.7134741, which is more negative due to the longer/branched chain.

Given that **CC(C)OC=O** is a smaller branched ester, its property value should be less negative than **CC(C)CCOC=O** but more negative than simple linear esters like **CCOC(=O)C**. 

A reasonable estimate would be between **-400 and -600**. Splitting the difference and considering the branching effect, a predicted value could be around **-500**. 

However, looking more closely at **CC(C)CCOC=O** (-606.7134741) and **CCOC(=O)C** (-362.15846777), **CC(C)OC=O** is smaller than both (shorter chain than the former, more branched than the latter), so a value closer to **-500** seems plausible. 

**Final predicted property value: -500.0** (rounded to one decimal place for consistency with the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., Gibbs free energy, heat of formation, etc.—this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the data.)

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -550.8872788980608
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and substituents. The molecule in question is **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, which is a methyl-substituted phenol (specifically, 2,4-dimethylphenol). 

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Phenol derivatives (with -OH)**:
   - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol) has a value of **-896.61682568**.
   - `Oc2ccc1CCCCc1c2` (a fused ring with -OH) has a value of **-40.27399916**.
   - `O=Cc1ccccc1` (benzaldehyde) has a value of **-770.01658936**.
   - `Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3` (a complex polyphenol) has a value of **828.01640538**.

2. **Methyl-substituted aromatics**:
   - `Cc1ccccc1C` (toluene derivative) has a value of **-368.90150079**.
   - `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (xylene derivative) has a value of **-696.36351466**.

3. **Combined effects**:
   - Adding methyl groups tends to decrease the property value (more negative or less positive).
   - Adding -OH to an aromatic ring tends to increase the property value (less negative or more positive) compared to pure hydrocarbons.

### Prediction for **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**:
- This is a dimethylphenol (2,4-dimethylphenol), with two methyl groups and one -OH on the benzene ring.
- Compared to phenol (`c1ccccc1O`, **-896.61682568**), the addition of two methyl groups would likely make the value less negative (since methyl groups are less polar than -OH and disrupt the phenol's strong polarity).
- Compared to toluene derivatives (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1C`, **-368.90150079**), the addition of -OH would increase the value (make it less negative or more positive).

Given these trends, the property value for **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** should be between the values for phenol and toluene derivatives, likely closer to the toluene value but less negative due to the -OH group. 

### Estimated value:
A reasonable prediction is **-500 ± 100**, based on interpolation from the examples. 

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**-450.0** (this is an approximate interpolation; exact values would require a model or more data). 

However, looking at similar molecules:
- `c1ccccc1O` (phenol): **-896.61682568**
- `Cc1ccccc1C` (toluene derivative): **-368.90150079**
- `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (xylene derivative): **-696.36351466**

The molecule is between phenol and xylene in complexity, so a value around **-500 to -600** is plausible. 

### Final prediction:  
**-550.0** (a compromise between the effects of the -OH and methyl groups). 

(Note: Without a clear mathematical pattern or model, this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 1733.2116780370106
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: 
   - Molecules with the **COP(=S)(OC)** fragment tend to have high positive property values (e.g., 1430.31351677, 1605.00937205, 1725.28751349, 3290.01308369). This suggests that the presence of this group significantly increases the property value.

2. **Aromatic Ring Substitutions**:
   - Substitutions on aromatic rings (e.g., Cl, Br, I, SC) further modulate the property value. For example:
     - **Cl** substitutions increase the value (e.g., 1430.31351677 for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**).
     - **SC** (thioether) substitutions are less common in the examples, but sulfur-containing groups (like **S(N)(=O)=O**) contribute positively (e.g., 69.49093044 for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**).

3. **Methyl Group (C)**:
   - A methyl group (**C**) on the aromatic ring (as in **c(C)c1**) is present in some examples but doesn't drastically alter the high values imposed by the **P(=S)** group.

4. **Comparison to Closest Example**:
   - The closest example is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** with a value of **1430.31351677**. 
   - Replacing the **Cl** groups with **SC** and **C** (thioether and methyl) would likely result in a similar or slightly lower value, as **SC** is less electron-withdrawing than **Cl**.

### Prediction:
Given the dominance of the **COP(=S)(OC)** fragment and the moderate contributions from **SC** and **C**, the property value for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** should be in the same range as the other phosphorothioate examples but slightly lower due to the less electronegative **SC** substitution compared to **Cl**.

**Predicted Property Value: ~1350.0**  
(Approximate, likely between 1300 and 1400 based on the trend.)  

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at the examples:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: 1430.31351677  
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl**: 1605.00937205 (Br increases value)  
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl**: 1725.28751349 (I increases value further)  

Since **SC** is less electronegative than **Cl**, the value should be slightly lower than 1430.31351677. A reasonable estimate is:

**Final Predicted Property Value: 1350.0** (rounded to one decimal place).  

This aligns with the observed trends while accounting for the substituent effects.

Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 934.0300778473065
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` by comparing its structure and substitution pattern to similar molecules in the dataset. 

### Observations:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Aromatic Systems**: 
   - The molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure with multiple chlorine substitutions on both aromatic rings. 
   - Similar molecules in the dataset with high chlorine substitution tend to have high positive property values. For example:
     - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a property value of **1137.59242163**.
     - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a property value of **1343.67315432**.

2. **Structural Similarity**:
   - The target molecule is very similar to the two examples above but with a slightly different substitution pattern (one ring has `c(Cl)ccccCl` instead of `c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)Cl`). 
   - The property value seems to increase with the number of chlorines and the symmetry of substitution.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The target molecule has 6 chlorine atoms (same as the first example above but with a less symmetrical substitution pattern than the second example). 
   - Its value is likely between the two examples but closer to the first one due to the less symmetrical substitution.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, I predict the property value for `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` to be approximately:  
**1200.0** (with an expected range of ±100 based on the trend). 

This is slightly higher than `1137.59242163` (due to the additional chlorine) but lower than `1343.67315432` (due to less symmetry). 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 1200.0** (estimated). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an interpolation based on the given examples. The property could be related to molecular energy, polarizability, or another descriptor correlated with chlorination.)

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -1000.0820098527237
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O** (1-nitropropane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`)**: 
     - The molecule `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (trinitrobenzene) has a property value of **-322.47159723**. This suggests that nitro groups can contribute negatively to the property, but the effect depends on the rest of the structure.
     - The molecule `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (dicyanobenzene) has a value of **-627.11318187**, while `Nc1ccccc1O` (aminophenol) has **-810.18443899**. This indicates that nitrogen-containing groups (especially nitro) may lower the property value.
   - **Alkyl chains**:
     - `CCC` (propane) has a value of **-1199.71127271**, while `CC` (ethane) has **-1374.06187535**. Longer alkyl chains seem to increase the property value (less negative).
     - `CCCCCCCCC` (nonane) has a positive value (**63.04749582**), suggesting that longer alkanes can invert the trend.

2. **Combination of Alkyl and Nitro Groups**:
   - The molecule `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` has a high positive value (**1117.54363472**), but this is likely due to the complex structure (two nitro groups, trifluoromethyl, and extended conjugation). This is an outlier and not directly comparable.
   - Simpler nitroalkanes like `CCCN(=O)=O` are not explicitly in the examples, but we can infer from the trends.

3. **Nitroalkane Approximation**:
   - The nitro group is electronegative and polar, which may reduce the property value (like in trinitrobenzene).
   - The propyl group (`CCC`) has a value of **-1199.71127271**, and adding a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) might reduce this further but not as drastically as in trinitrobenzene (since there's only one nitro group here).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Propane (`CCC`) has a value of **-1199.71127271**.
- Adding a nitro group (which tends to decrease the property, but not extremely) might adjust the value to somewhere between **-1000 and -500**.

Looking at similar molecules:
- `CC(=C)C` (isobutene) has **-1225.24432731**.
- `CCCN(CCC)...` (complex nitro) has **+1117.54363472**, but this is not directly comparable.
- `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (trinitrobenzene) has **-322.47159723**.

For **CCCN(=O)=O**, a reasonable estimate would be slightly higher (less negative) than propane but still negative due to the nitro group. 

### Final Prediction:
**-800.0** (approximate, based on interpolation of trends). 

This is a rough estimate given the limited examples, but it aligns with the observed trends for nitroalkanes and simple alkanes.

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -535.4511716334298
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values are influenced by the presence and type of substituents on aromatic rings, as well as the overall molecular structure. 

For the molecule `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` (4-bromofluorobenzene), we can compare it to similar structures in the dataset:
1. `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` (4-bromochlorobenzene) has a property value of **-376.3585208**.
2. `COc1ccccc1Cl` (4-chloroanisole) has a property value of **-529.41540916**.
3. `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a property value of **727.94934516**.

The presence of halogens (F, Cl, Br) tends to decrease the property value compared to non-halogenated or less halogenated analogs. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine but less bulky, while bromine is larger and less electronegative than chlorine. 

Given that `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` has one fluorine and one bromine (similar in substitution pattern to `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` but with F instead of Cl), we can expect the property value to be slightly higher (less negative) than `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` because fluorine is less polarizable than chlorine, but bromine is larger and may offset this effect. 

### Predicted Property Value for `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`:  
**-350.0** (approximate, based on interpolation from similar structures).  

This is a rough estimate, as the exact property being predicted (e.g., energy, solubility, etc.) is not explicitly defined, but the trend suggests a value in this range.

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 168.12327709161949
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value. Here's my reasoning:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Molecular Framework**: The molecule is a bicyclic structure with a hydroxyl group (OH) and two tertiary carbons (attached to methyl groups). It resembles steroid-like or terpene-like frameworks in the given examples (e.g., **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**, which has a property value of **2914.87848018**).
2. **Functional Groups**: 
   - One hydroxyl group (OH), which is polar and can form hydrogen bonds.
   - No halogens, double bonds, or aromatic rings, which simplifies the prediction compared to more complex examples.
3. **Size and Complexity**: 
   - The molecule is medium-sized (10 carbons, 1 oxygen) but less complex than the large polycyclic examples with high property values (e.g., >2000).
   - It is more complex than simple linear/branched chains (e.g., **CCCCBr**, property = -491.88305474) but lacks the additional functional groups that drive values higher.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**: This is a much larger polycyclic molecule with multiple functional groups (ketone, alcohol, ester), yielding a high value (**2914.87848018**). Our molecule is smaller and less functionalized.
- **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2**: This has a similar bicyclic core but with additional aromatic rings and halogens, giving a value of **2054.76448026**. Our molecule lacks these features.
- **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**: Another large polycyclic with ketone and alcohol groups, value = **2474.12615754**.
- **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: Similar bicyclic framework with a ketone and alcohol, value = **2305.0967426**.

### Key Observations:
1. The presence of a hydroxyl group and polycyclic structure tends to increase the property value compared to simple alkanes.
2. Smaller polycyclic molecules without additional functional groups (e.g., ketones, halogens) have lower values than the large examples above but higher than linear/branched chains.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the molecule's size and functionalization, it is most comparable to **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (value = **2305.0967426**) but smaller and less functionalized. A reasonable estimate would be **~1000–1500**. 

However, looking at simpler bicyclic examples (none are provided directly), I would lean toward the lower end of this range. A plausible prediction is:

**Predicted Property Value: 1250.0**  
*(This is an educated guess based on interpolation between the given examples.)*

Iteration: 33
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 1788.3022754994176
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property value for the molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` by comparing its structural features to those in the training data. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Training Data:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P=S) Group**: The molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` has a P=S group and a similar structure (with an additional SC(CCl) group) and a property value of **3143.03423032**. This suggests that the P=S group contributes significantly to high property values.

2. **Lactam Ring (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: The presence of a lactam ring (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O) is also seen in the training data (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` with value 3143.03423032 and `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCCC1)C(=O)N2` with value 233.63174876). The lactam ring alone does not seem to contribute as much as the P=S group, but in combination, they lead to very high values.

3. **Ethoxy Groups (CCO)**: The ethoxy groups (OCC) are present in both `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (value 3143.03423032) and the target molecule. These likely contribute moderately to the property value.

### Comparison to the Target Molecule:
The target molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` is very similar to `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (value 3143.03423032), except it lacks the `SC(CCl)` group. The `SC(CCl)` group likely adds some additional bulk and polarity, but the core P=S and lactam features are the dominant contributors.

### Adjusting for Missing `SC(CCl)` Group:
Removing the `SC(CCl)` group would likely reduce the property value, but not drastically, since the P=S and lactam are the primary contributors. The training example `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` has a value of 3143.03423032, and the target molecule is simpler. 

Looking at other examples with P=S or lactam groups, the values are still high (e.g., 3143.03423032 for the full structure). The absence of `SC(CCl)` might reduce the value by ~500-1000 units (this is a rough estimate based on the impact of similar substituents in other examples).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, I predict the property value for `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` to be approximately **2500-2800**. 

To narrow it down further, since the molecule is very similar to the one with value 3143.03423032 but missing a significant substituent (`SC(CCl)`), I'll estimate a reduction of ~600-700 units, leading to a prediction of:

**Predicted property value: ~2540.0** (rounded to one decimal place for consistency with the training data). 

This is a rough estimate based on structural similarity and trends in the training data. For a more precise prediction, a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model or additional similar examples would be needed.

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 103.44670278809313
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might help us estimate the value.

### Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Heteroatoms and Substituents**:
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (especially fused or substituted) tend to have higher positive values. For example:
     - **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (826.02533145) has a fused aromatic system with N and O.
     - **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32** (59.04327767) has a simpler fused aromatic system with N.
   - The presence of carbonyl (=O) groups often increases the value, especially when conjugated with aromatic systems.

2. **Aliphatic Chains and Simple Functional Groups**:
   - Simple aliphatic chains or small functional groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -Br) tend to have negative values. For example:
     - **CCCCOC** (-783.07805728)
     - **CCCCI** (-321.78407586).

3. **Hybrid Systems**:
   - Molecules with both aromatic and aliphatic parts (or multiple functional groups) can have intermediate or high values depending on the complexity. For example:
     - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (321.60174129) has two aromatic rings linked by an aliphatic chain.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**
- This molecule has:
  - A fused aromatic system with two nitrogen atoms (n1 and n2) and a carbonyl group (=O).
  - A methyl group (C) attached to the nitrogen (n1) and another methyl group on the aromatic ring (Cc1).
  - A phenyl ring (c2ccccc2) attached to the nitrogen (n2).
- This is structurally similar to **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (value: 826.02533145), which also has a fused aromatic system with N and O, though the exact arrangement differs.
- The presence of the carbonyl group (=O) and the aromatic system suggests a relatively high positive value.

### Prediction:
Given the similarities to the example with a value of ~826 and accounting for the slightly less complex fused system in the target molecule, a reasonable estimate would be slightly lower but still in the same range. 

**Predicted property value: ~750.0** (exact value could be between 700-800 based on the given examples). 

However, looking more closely, the target molecule is less fused (no fully fused third ring like in the example) and has fewer conjugated systems, so a more precise estimate might be closer to **600-700**. 

Given the examples, a plausible specific prediction is:  
**650.0** (this is an educated guess based on the trends). 

But to match the precision of the given examples, let's refine this further. The molecule is somewhat between **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32** (59.04) and **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (826.03), but closer to the latter due to the carbonyl and additional aromatic ring. 

Thus, a more accurate prediction might be:  
**700.0** (rounded to one decimal place: **700.00000000**). 

However, looking at the examples again, the presence of the =O and the two aromatic rings (one fused) suggests a value closer to **500-600**. For instance, **O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (two aromatic rings linked by =O) has a value of 109.89, but the fused system here increases it. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest prediction is:  
**600.00000000**. 

But to be more precise, let's average the closest examples: 
- **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O**: 826.03 
- **O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: 109.89  
The target molecule is structurally between these, so perhaps ~450-500. 

Given the complexity, the final predicted value is:  
**500.00000000**. 

However, this is still uncertain. The most reasonable estimate based on the given data is:  
**550.00000000**. 

After reconsidering, the best match is likely between 500-600, so the predicted value is:  
**550.00000000**. 

### Final Answer:
**550.00000000**
==================================================
Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -126.16561840785009
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I will attempt to predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate) by identifying patterns in the data.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Esters (e.g., COC=O, CCOC(=O)N)**: Tend to have negative property values (e.g., -1424.71836464 for COC=O, -1082.48862763 for CCOC(=O)N).
   - **Carboxylic acids/derivatives**: Some esters or carbonyl-containing molecules have positive values (e.g., 257.90935347 for CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC), but simpler esters are negative.
   - **Chain Length**: Longer aliphatic chains with polar groups (e.g., CCCCCCCCI = 309.59530841) can have positive values, but neutral esters like this one may not follow that trend.
   - **Ethyl Hexanoate (CCCCCC(=O)OCC)**: This is a neutral ester with a 6-carbon chain and an ethoxy group. Similar examples (e.g., CCOC(=O)N = -1082.48862763) suggest negative values for simple esters.

2. **Specific Comparisons**:
   - **CCC(=C)C** (small alkene): -989.25147795
   - **CCCCCC** (hexane): Not in the list, but **CCCCC** (pentane) is -778.7916832. Adding a carbon might trend toward more negative.
   - **CCOC(=O)N**: -1082.48862763 (ester-like, similar to ethyl hexanoate but with an amide).
   - **CCCCCCCC(=O)OC**: 257.90935347 (longer-chain ester, positive value).

3. **Prediction**:
   - Ethyl hexanoate is a neutral ester with moderate chain length. Given that smaller esters (e.g., COC=O) are highly negative and longer-chain esters can be positive, this molecule likely falls in the middle. 
   - The presence of the ester group may dominate, leading to a negative value, but the chain length could moderate it.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is:  
**-450.0** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar molecules).  

(Note: Without a clear mathematical model or more examples of esters with this chain length, this is an educated guess based on the provided data.)  

Would you like me to refine this further with additional reasoning?

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -541.828004145602
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on the molecular structures. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** COC(=O)c1ccccc1  
**Structure:** Methyl benzoate (a benzene ring with a carboxylate ester group: -COOCH3)

From the examples, we can compare this to similar structures:
1. **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC** (a diester with a longer alkyl chain) has a property value of **2050.29184928**.
2. **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) has a property value of **-294.52359175**.
3. **CCOC(=O)c1cncn1C(C)c2ccccc2** (a more complex ester with additional rings) has a property value of **720.35684913**.

Methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1) is simpler than ethyl benzoate (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1) but has a similar functional group. The property value for ethyl benzoate is **-294.52359175**, and methyl benzoate is likely to have a slightly lower (more negative) value due to the shorter alkyl chain (methyl vs. ethyl).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is:  
**-310.0** (estimated based on the similarity to ethyl benzoate and adjusting for the shorter chain). 

However, looking more closely at the examples, the presence of the ester group seems to correlate with values in the range of **-200 to -800** for simpler structures. Since methyl benzoate is very similar to ethyl benzoate but with one fewer carbon, we can estimate a slight decrease in the property value. 

A more precise estimate would be slightly lower than ethyl benzoate's **-294.52359175**, so:  
**Predicted property value: -300.0** (rounded for simplicity). 

But to match the precision of the given examples, we could suggest:  
**-305.0** (interpolating between ethyl benzoate and other similar esters). 

Given the data, the closest analog is ethyl benzoate (**-294.52359175**), and methyl benzoate should be very close. Thus, the predicted value is likely in the range of **-290 to -310**. 

### Final Predicted Value:
**-300.0** (approximate, based on the trend). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples.) 

For higher precision, if we assume the property scales linearly with small changes in structure, we might predict:  
**-300.0** (intermediate between ethyl benzoate and other similar molecules). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is:  
**-300.0**. 

(If more examples were provided, a more accurate prediction could be made.) 

---

**Answer:** The predicted property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is approximately **-300.0**. 

(Note: This is an estimate based on the limited examples provided. The actual value may vary depending on the specific property being predicted.) 

---

**Refined Prediction:**  
Looking again at the examples, the simplest aromatic ester (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1) has a value of **-294.52359175**, and the non-aromatic ester (CC(C)OC(=O)C) has **-827.43419195**. Methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1) is almost identical to ethyl benzoate but with a methyl instead of an ethyl group, so the value should be very close to **-294.52359175**. 

Thus, a more precise prediction would be:  
**-290.0** (very slightly less negative than ethyl benzoate due to the shorter chain). 

However, since methyl groups are often slightly less stabilizing than ethyl groups in such contexts, the value might be slightly more negative. 

**Final refined prediction:**  
**-300.0**. 

---

Given the uncertainty, the most reasonable prediction is:  
**-300.0**. 

---

**Conclusion:**  
The predicted property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is **-300.0** (based on interpolation from the given examples).
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -1107.6226535009166
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with the molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features of the molecules. For instance:

- Simple hydrocarbons like `CC/C=C/C` (butadiene-like structure) have negative property values (e.g., `-942.1820978`).
- Molecules with more complex functional groups (e.g., halogens, carbonyls, aromatic rings, etc.) tend to have higher (often positive) property values.
- The presence of double bonds (`C=C`) in simple hydrocarbons also seems to contribute to negative property values (e.g., `C=Cc1ccccc1` has `-697.38858521`).

The molecule in question is `C=CCC=C` (1,3-butadiene), which is a simple hydrocarbon with two double bonds. Comparing it to similar molecules in the examples:

1. `CC/C=C/C` (similar to butadiene but with a slightly different structure) has a property value of `-942.1820978`.
2. `C=Cc1ccccc1` (styrene-like structure) has `-697.38858521`.
3. `CCCc1ccccc1` (propylbenzene) has `-333.82486833`.

Given that `C=CCC=C` is simpler than `CC/C=C/C` (no branching) but has the same number of carbons and double bonds, we can infer its property value would be slightly less negative (closer to zero) than `-942.1820978`. 

A reasonable prediction for `C=CCC=C` would be around **`-850.0`**, interpolating between the given examples. 

### Predicted property value for `C=CCC=C`: **`-850.0`** (approximate, based on trend). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. The property could relate to molecular polarizability, boiling point, or another descriptor, but the pattern suggests simpler/less polar molecules have more negative values.)
==================================================
Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: -363.1476074050583
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with the molecular weight and the presence of heavy atoms (like halogens: Cl, Br, I) or complex functional groups (like phosphates, nitro groups, etc.). The property values tend to increase with the molecular weight and the presence of heavy or polarizable atoms.

Let's analyze the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane):

1. **Molecular structure**: The molecule consists of a central carbon atom bonded to three bromine atoms. Bromine is a heavy halogen, and its presence significantly increases the molecular weight and polarizability.

2. **Comparison with similar molecules**:
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** has a property value of **-681.99896263**. This molecule contains fluorine, chlorine, and bromine, which are all halogens but with varying atomic weights. The presence of fluorine (lighter) and chlorine (intermediate) likely reduces the property value compared to a molecule with only bromine.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a very high property value of **1343.67315432**, which is consistent with the high molecular weight and multiple heavy atoms (chlorine).
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a property value of **13.86349831**, which is relatively low despite the presence of bromine, likely due to the aromatic system balancing the effect.

3. **Tribromomethane (BrC(Br)Br)**:
   - Molecular weight: C (12) + 3 × Br (3 × 80) = 252 g/mol.
   - The molecule is small but has three heavy bromine atoms, which should contribute significantly to the property value. 
   - Given that **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (with lighter halogens) has a negative value and **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (with one Br and an aromatic system) has a small positive value, **BrC(Br)Br** should have a higher positive value due to the three bromines.

4. **Prediction**:
   - The property value is likely positive and moderately high, but not as high as molecules with many more heavy atoms or complex structures.
   - A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **200–400**.

Given the examples, I predict the property value for **BrC(Br)Br** to be approximately **312.45678901**. 

(Note: The exact value cannot be determined without knowing the specific property being calculated, but this is a plausible estimate based on the trend in the given data.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 3143.034230321042
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values vary widely based on the molecular structure, size, and functional groups. The molecule in question is:

**CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: Present in some of the larger molecules in the examples (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` with a property value of 2780.5857532). This group tends to contribute significantly to the property value.
2. **Aromatic ring (c1ccccc1)**: Common in many examples, with varying contributions depending on substitutions.
3. **Chloroalkyl group (C(CCl))**: Similar to `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (-141.41129961) but here it's part of a larger structure.
4. **Lactam ring (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: Similar to `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` (1122.86739964), but without the chloro substitutions.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The molecule is structurally most similar to `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property = 2780.5857532), but with a lactam ring instead of a chloroaromatic group and a smaller alkyl chain.
- The lactam ring contribution is similar to `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` (1122.86739964), but without the chloro substitutions, which would reduce the value slightly.
- The phosphorothioate group is a major contributor, as seen in the example with a value of 2780.5857532, but the rest of the molecule is less complex.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the contributions:
1. Phosphorothioate + ethyl groups: ~2500 (scaled down from 2780 due to smaller size).
2. Lactam ring: ~1000 (scaled down from 1122 due to lack of chloro substitutions).
3. Chloroalkyl group: ~-100 (small contribution, slightly negative).

Adding these, the estimated property value is approximately **3400**. However, looking at the examples, the largest value is 3505.13746391 for a very large molecule, and this molecule is smaller but still complex. A more precise estimate would be slightly lower, around **3000-3200**.

### Final Prediction:
After balancing the contributions, the predicted property value for `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` is:

**3120.45** (approximate, based on structural similarity and contributions from functional groups). 

This is a rough estimate given the complexity and lack of a clear linear trend in the examples. For a more precise value, computational methods would be needed.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 1303.12626736437
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values appear to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, halogens, and heteroatoms. The molecule in question is:

**CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**

### Key structural features:
1. **Amide group**: **C(=O)N** (similar to examples like CN(C)C(=O)C and CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, which have values around -767 to -1027).
2. **Aromatic ring with chlorine substitution**: **c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)** (similar to Cl-substituted aromatics like Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has -541.87).
3. **Heterocyclic ring with N and O**: **n2nc(oc2=O)** (similar to structures like c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32, which has 59.04).
4. **Bulky tert-butyl group**: **C(C)(C)C** (increases steric bulk, similar to C(C)C in CCC(C)C, which has -839.47).
5. **Polar and conjugated system**: The molecule has multiple polar groups and conjugation, which may increase the property value.

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** has a value of -767.85679824 (simpler amide).
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has -541.87476809 (chloro-nitro aromatic).
- **Nc1cccc2ccccc12** has -275.44392515 (aromatic with N).
- **CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O** has 476.11620538 (heterocyclic with polar groups).

Given the additional complexity (chlorine, heterocycle, bulky group, and conjugation), the property value is likely **higher than simpler amides but lower than highly polar or large systems**. 

### Predicted value:
Considering the contributions:
- Base amide: ~ -767
- Chloro-aromatic: adds ~ +200 (from comparison)
- Heterocycle (n2nc(oc2=O)): adds ~ +300
- Bulky group: adds ~ +100
- Conjugation/polarity: adds ~ +200

Approximate sum: **-767 + 200 + 300 + 100 + 200 = ~ +33**

However, the examples show that such complex molecules often have **positive values in the hundreds**. Given the closest analogs (e.g., 476.116 for a heterocyclic amide), I predict:

**Predicted property value: 487.326** (rounded to 3 decimal places). 

This accounts for the combined effects of the amide, chloro-substitution, heterocycle, and steric bulk.

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 650.0406559007541
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might help us estimate the value.

### Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Presence of Chlorine (Cl)**: 
   - Molecules with multiple Cl atoms tend to have moderately negative to positive values. For example:
     - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` → -492.01052702
     - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` → 325.8614354
     - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` → -82.36745055
   - The more Cl atoms, the less negative (or more positive) the value seems to become.

2. **Presence of Oxygen (O) and Hydroxyl (OH) Groups**:
   - Molecules with OH groups often have negative values, especially if they are polyols (multiple OH groups). For example:
     - `OCC(O)C(O)CO` → -827.42066505
     - `OCC3OC(OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C(O)C3O` → 2413.71605258 (this is an outlier due to its large size and multiple functional groups).

3. **Aromatic Rings and Substitution Patterns**:
   - Aromatic rings with Cl and OH substitutions tend to have negative values unless there are many Cl atoms or other bulky groups. For example:
     - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` → -492.01052702
     - `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` → -668.18433317

4. **Symmetry and Size**:
   - Larger, more symmetric molecules with multiple aromatic rings and substitutions tend to have less negative or positive values. For example:
     - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` → 325.8614354 (two aromatic rings with Cl substitutions).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, which consists of:
- Two aromatic rings connected by an oxygen bridge (O).
- Each ring has one Cl substitution and one OH substitution.
- An additional Cl substitution on the second ring.

This is similar to:
- `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (-492.01052702), but with an additional aromatic ring and Cl substitution.
- `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` (325.8614354), which has two aromatic rings with Cl substitutions but no OH groups.

Given that the target molecule has two OH groups and three Cl atoms, the OH groups will contribute to a more negative value, while the Cl atoms will push it toward less negative or positive. The symmetry and size (two aromatic rings) will also increase the value compared to single-ring analogs.

### Estimated Value:
Given the trends:
- The base value for a single-ring system with OH and Cl is around -500 (e.g., -492 for `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl`).
- Adding another aromatic ring with OH and Cl would likely reduce the negativity (since larger systems tend to have less negative values).
- The additional Cl substitution would further push the value toward less negative or positive.

Given these competing effects, a reasonable estimate would be slightly less negative than -492 but not as positive as 325 (since the OH groups dominate over the Cl substitutions). 

**Predicted Property Value: -350.0** (This is an educated guess based on the trends observed in the given examples.) 

However, looking more closely at `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (-82.36745055), which has 4 Cl atoms and 1 OH, the value is much less negative. Our target has 3 Cl and 2 OH, so it might be slightly more negative than -82 but less negative than -492. 

A better estimate might be around **-200 to -300**. 

Given the examples, a reasonable prediction is:  
**-275.0** (This balances the effects of the OH and Cl groups and the larger size of the molecule.) 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** is approximately **-275.0**.
==================================================
Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -942.1820977970831
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as conjugation, halogenation, and ring systems. 

The molecule in question is `CC/C=C\C`, which is trans-2-pentene (or a similar alkene with the double bond in the middle). This is a simple, unconjugated alkene with no additional functional groups or rings. 

Comparing this to similar molecules in the dataset:
- `CC/C=C/C` (likely cis-2-pentene or similar) has a property value of `-942.1820978`.
- `CCCC(=O)OC` (a simple ester) has a property value of `-794.38962031`.
- `CCCCCC` (hexane) is not in the dataset, but simpler alkanes like `CC(C)C` (isobutane) have negative values (e.g., `-629.01079457` for `CCCC(C)C`).

Since `CC/C=C\C` is very similar to `CC/C=C/C` (only differing in the stereochemistry of the double bond, which likely has a minimal effect on the property in this context), we can predict that its property value will be close to that of `CC/C=C/C`. 

Thus, the predicted property value for `CC/C=C\C` is approximately:

**-942.1820978** (same as `CC/C=C/C`, as stereochemistry is unlikely to significantly alter the property in this case). 

If the dataset had shown a consistent difference between cis and trans alkenes, we might adjust slightly, but here we lack that evidence. Therefore, the value is likely very close to the given example.
==================================================
Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -746.2334396419095
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether) by comparing its structure and functional groups to the molecules in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Functional Group and Size**: The molecule is an ether (R-O-R') with a relatively small size (6 carbons, 14 hydrogens, and 1 oxygen). Ethers are polar but not as polar as alcohols or carbonyl-containing compounds. 

2. **Similar Molecules in the Dataset**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): Property = -1200.26441756. This is an alcohol, which is more polar than an ether, and smaller (3 carbons). The property is highly negative.
   - **CC(C)Cl** (isopropyl chloride): Property = -1033.38883389. This is a halide, also polar, with 3 carbons. The property is negative but less so than the alcohol.
   - **CCC(O)CC** (3-pentanol): Property = -747.35089634. This is a larger alcohol (5 carbons), and the property is less negative than the smaller alcohol.
   - **CCOC(=O)C** (ethyl acetate): Not in the dataset, but esters are more polar than ethers.
   - **CCCCCC** (hexane): Not in the dataset, but alkanes are nonpolar and would likely have very negative properties (similar to **C**, which is methane, with property = -1794.98146486).

3. **Trends**:
   - Oxygen-containing functional groups (alcohols, ethers, carbonyls) tend to have less negative (or more positive) properties compared to pure hydrocarbons.
   - Larger molecules tend to have less negative properties than smaller ones (compare **C** vs. **CC#C** vs. **CCC#C**).
   - Ethers are less polar than alcohols, so their properties might be less negative than alcohols of similar size.

4. **Prediction for CCCOCC**:
   - It is larger than **CC(C)O** and **CC(C)Cl** but less polar (ether vs. alcohol/halide). 
   - It is similar in size to **CCC(O)CC** (5 carbons vs. 6 carbons), but an ether is less polar than an alcohol.
   - The property is likely less negative than **CCC(O)CC** (-747.35089634) but more negative than some of the larger/polar molecules in the dataset.

Given these observations, a reasonable prediction for **CCCOCC** would be in the range of **-500 to -700**. A specific estimate could be around **-600**. 

However, looking at the dataset more closely, **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (isopropyl acetate) has a property of -633.29716865, which is an ester (more polar than an ether) with 5 carbons. Since **CCCOCC** is an ether with 6 carbons, it might be slightly less negative, say around **-550**.

But to pick a specific value, I'll average the trends and predict:  
**Predicted property for CCCOCC: -580.0**.

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited dataset and trends. The actual property could vary depending on the specific property being predicted, which isn't explicitly defined here.)

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 1012.5179096009449
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromatic rings, branching, and polar substituents. The molecule in question is:

**CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: Two phenyl rings (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`) contribute positively to the property value, as seen in similar structures (e.g., `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has a value of 321.60174129).
2. **Tertiary Amide Group**: The `N(C(=O)N...)` group is polar and likely increases the property value, similar to other amide-containing molecules (e.g., `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` has a value of 1300.83848568).
3. **Tertiary Carbon Substituent**: The `C(C)(C)` group adds steric bulk but is less polar, which may moderate the increase from the aromatic and amide groups.
4. **Symmetry and Conjugation**: The molecule is symmetric with conjugated systems, which often increases property values (e.g., symmetric aromatic systems like `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` have high values).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule is structurally similar to `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` (value = 1300.83848568), but with a simpler linker (`NC(C)(C)` instead of `COc1nc2ccccc2s1`). The latter has an additional heterocyclic ring, which likely contributes more to its higher value.
- The presence of two phenyl rings and a tertiary amide suggests a value in the range of **1000–1500**, based on analogous examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the balance between aromaticity, amide polarity, and reduced complexity compared to the 1300.838 example, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 1250.0** (rounded to one decimal place for consistency with the provided data). 

This aligns with the trend where aromatic + amide groups yield values in this range, while simpler linkers (like `NC(C)(C)`) reduce the value slightly compared to more complex linkers.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -108.15805611694087
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Bromine (Br) Substituents**: 
   - Molecules with Br substituents tend to have positive or moderately positive property values (e.g., `c1ccccc1n2ncc(N)c(Br)c2(=O)` → 343.10, `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` → -535.45, `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` → -520.88). 
   - The presence of Br alone does not guarantee a positive value, but it often contributes to higher values compared to similar molecules without Br.

2. **Amide Group (N-C=O)**:
   - Molecules with amide groups (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` → 1012.52, `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` → 74.64) often have positive property values, especially when combined with aromatic rings.

3. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing or donating substituents can significantly influence the property value. For example, `Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1` → -713.49 (aldehyde + hydroxyl), while `CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` → 734.56 (amide + two aromatic rings).

4. **Combination of Features**:
   - The molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** contains:
     - An amide group (`CC(=O)N`).
     - An aromatic ring (`c1ccc(Br)cc1`).
     - A bromine substituent.
   - Similar molecules with these features (amide + aromatic + Br) are not explicitly present in the examples, but we can interpolate:
     - `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` → -520.88 (no amide, just Br + hydroxyl).
     - `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` → 1012.52 (bulkier amide + two aromatic rings).
     - `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` → 74.64 (cyclic amide).

### Prediction:
Given the presence of the amide group and bromine on an aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be **positive and moderate**, similar to other amide-containing aromatic compounds but lower than bulky or multi-ring systems. 

A reasonable estimate would be between **50 and 150**, considering:
- The amide group adds a positive contribution.
- The bromine adds a moderate positive contribution.
- The simplicity of the structure (single aromatic ring) limits the value compared to more complex examples.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1: 85.0**  
*(This is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -184.04397970285754
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate the molecular structure with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Benzene Derivatives**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene): -693.84512575
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene): -697.38858521
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene): -371.4198897
   - **Cc1cccc2ccccc12** (methylnaphthalene): -186.49314955
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1** (phenylacetonitrile): -791.38692831
   - **Brc1ccccc1** (bromobenzene): -577.40247569

   The property values for benzene derivatives with simple substituents (methyl, ethyl, vinyl, bromo, cyano) range between -700 and -100, with the exact value depending on the substituent's nature and size.

2. **Alkyl Substituents**:
   - Adding alkyl groups (e.g., **CC(C)C**) tends to decrease the property value (make it less negative or more positive) compared to just a methyl group. For example:
     - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol): -1003.99922394
     - **CC(C)CCO** (isobutyl alcohol): -793.53942918
     - **CC(C)CCCO** (isoamyl alcohol): -583.07963443

3. **Combined Alkyl-Benzene Structures**:
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene): -371.4198897
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene): -210.32743803
   - **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isobutylbenzene) is structurally similar but with a longer alkyl chain than isopropyltoluene. The property value should be less negative than isopropyltoluene (-210.32743803) but more negative than ethyltoluene (-371.4198897).

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- Toluene: -693.84512575
- Ethyltoluene: -371.4198897
- Isopropyltoluene: -210.32743803

The addition of an isobutyl group (**CC(C)C-**) to benzene would likely result in a property value less negative than isopropyltoluene but more negative than larger or more complex substituents. 

A reasonable estimate for **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is **-250.0**, interpolating between the given examples.

### Final Answer:
**-250.0** (predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1).
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -770.0165893561809
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with the molecular structure, including functional groups, aromaticity, and substituents. Let's analyze the given molecule and compare it to similar examples:

**Molecule to predict:**  
`O=Cc1ccccc1` (benzaldehyde)

This molecule consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group (`O=C`). Let's look for similar structures in the examples:

1. `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` (property: -619.03469019) – This is a benzene ring with an amide (`NC(=O)`) and a hydroxyl (`O`) group. The amide is somewhat similar to the aldehyde, but the additional hydroxyl group likely lowers the property value further.
2. `COc1ccccc1` (property: -732.97775294) – This is a benzene ring with a methoxy group (`OCH3`), which is less polar than an aldehyde but still electron-donating.
3. `c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45` (property: 1138.86371719) – This is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), which has a very high property value due to its extended conjugation.
4. `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (property: -530.17677119) – This is a benzene ring with two nitro groups (`NO2`), which are strongly electron-withdrawing.

The aldehyde group in `O=Cc1ccccc1` is electron-withdrawing but not as strongly as nitro groups. It is also more polar than a simple methoxy group. Given this, the property value for benzaldehyde should be between the values for the methoxy-substituted benzene (-732.97775294) and the nitro-substituted benzene (-530.17677119), but likely closer to the latter because the aldehyde is more electron-withdrawing than the methoxy group.

**Prediction:**  
A reasonable estimate for the property value of `O=Cc1ccccc1` is around **-600**. 

However, looking more closely at the examples, the amide-substituted benzene (`NC(=O)c1ccccc1O`) with an additional hydroxyl group has a value of -619.03469019. Since benzaldehyde lacks the hydroxyl group but has a similar carbonyl (aldehyde instead of amide), its value might be slightly higher (less negative). 

Thus, a more refined prediction would be:  
**Predicted property value: -550.0** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the data). 

This is an educated guess given the limited examples and the absence of a clear linear trend or simple functional group contribution rule. For a more accurate prediction, a larger dataset or a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model would be needed.
==================================================
Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 80.71928672108382
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and presence of nitro or carbonyl groups. 

The molecule in question is:  
**O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**

### Key structural features:
1. **Two carbonyl groups (C=O)**: These are present in the form of amides (or urea-like structure), which are polar and can contribute positively to the property value.
2. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: This is a strongly electron-withdrawing group, often associated with higher property values in the examples (e.g., Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 has a high value of 600.17641483).
3. **Heterocyclic and conjugated system**: The molecule includes a fused ring system with nitrogen and oxygen, which can enhance the property value due to conjugation and rigidity.
4. **Aromatic ring with oxygen (o1)**: This adds to the complexity and polarity.

### Comparison with similar examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups and aromatic systems tend to have high positive values (e.g., 600.17641483, 934.89811861).
- Urea or amide-like structures (e.g., CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2) also have high values (1012.5179096).
- The presence of multiple polar groups (C=O, N=O) suggests a significant positive contribution.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to high-value examples (nitro + amide + aromatic), I predict this molecule will have a **high positive property value**, likely in the range of **800–1000**. 

A precise estimate based on the examples would be:  
**Predicted property value: 912.45678901**  

(This is an interpolation based on the observed trends for nitro-aromatic and amide-containing molecules in the dataset.)

Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 129.19654258735747
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **-869.22828805**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (a diazo compound linking two phenyl rings) has a property value of **85.9317314**.
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is structurally similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but with a single N-N bond instead of a double N=N bond.

2. **Effect of Nitrogen Connectivity**:
   - Single N-N bonds (as in hydrazines or similar structures) tend to have lower (more negative) property values compared to double N=N bonds (as in diazo compounds), which are less negative or even positive.
   - The presence of two phenyl rings attached to nitrogen (as in **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**) is similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but the single N-N bond should reduce the property value compared to the diazo compound.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is a diphenylhydrazine derivative. Compared to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property = **85.9317314**), the single N-N bond should result in a lower value.
   - Given that **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a value of **-869.22828805**, and the diazo compound has a positive value, the diphenylhydrazine structure is likely intermediate but closer to the diazo compound due to the two phenyl rings stabilizing the system.
   - A reasonable estimate would be slightly negative or near zero, but less negative than aniline.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is approximately **-50.0**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples provided. For precise predictions, computational methods or more extensive training data would be required.)

Iteration: 50
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 23.171954006898616
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide (N-C=O) groups and a cyclic ketone (C=O) embedded in a bicyclic structure.
   - It resembles a cyclic imide (two amides fused to a ring) with an additional cyclohexane ring (CCCC1).

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (Property: 585.07176892): This is a similar cyclic imide with alkyl substituents. The property is moderately positive.
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (Property: 74.63612753): Another cyclic imide with smaller substituents, yielding a smaller positive value.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** has a larger structure than the given molecule but shares the imide core. The given molecule lacks the additional alkyl chains, so its property should be lower than 585 but higher than 74.6.

3. **Ring Strain and Symmetry**:
   - The molecule has a bicyclic structure with a cyclohexane fused to a 5-membered imide ring. Cyclohexane is strain-free, and the imide ring is planar and stable.
   - Symmetry and rigidity often correlate with higher property values in the examples (e.g., aromaticity and fused rings increase the value).

4. **Polarity**:
   - The two amide groups introduce significant polarity, which may increase the property value compared to less polar examples.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2** should be:
- Higher than **74.6** (smaller imide) but lower than **585** (larger imide with alkyl chains).
- Closer to **300–500** due to the balanced size and polarity.

A reasonable estimate is **~400**. However, looking for closer analogs:
- The molecule is structurally similar to succinimide derivatives but with a fused cyclohexane. Succinimide-like structures in the examples (e.g., **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1**) have values ~74, but the added ring here would increase it.

Given the lack of exact matches, a conservative prediction is **~350–450**. 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 420.0** (interpolated based on structural similarity and trends).
==================================================
Iteration: 51
SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 526.9053902798572
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene): Property = **-548.53598718**
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (hexachlorodiphenylmethane): Property = **1296.03874641**
   - **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O**: Property = **1075.1000566**

   The presence of multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings tends to increase the property value, especially when the molecule is larger or more complex.

2. **Symmetry and Substitution**:
   - Symmetrical molecules with multiple chlorines (e.g., **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**) have high positive values.
   - Simpler chlorinated aromatics (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1Cl**) have negative values.

3. **Target Molecule**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is a **trichlorinated biphenyl** (three chlorines: two on one ring, one on the other). It is larger than dichlorobenzene but smaller and less substituted than hexachlorodiphenylmethane.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Dichlorobenzene: **-548.53598718**
- Hexachlorodiphenylmethane: **1296.03874641**

The trichlorinated biphenyl is intermediate in size and substitution. Its property value should be higher than dichlorobenzene but lower than hexachlorodiphenylmethane. 

From the examples, a reasonable estimate would be in the **positive range but not as high as 1296**. A plausible prediction is around **500–800**. 

Looking at similar-sized chlorinated aromatics:
- **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O** (property = 1075.1000566) is larger but has additional functional groups.
- The trichlorobiphenyl lacks additional functional groups, so its value should be lower.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is:  
**678.42531953**  

(This is an educated guess based on interpolation of the given examples.)

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -135.42704033517035
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values appear to correlate with molecular weight, polarity, and structural complexity (e.g., presence of functional groups, rings, and heteroatoms). The molecule in question is **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1**, which is **diethylbenzene** (specifically, 1,4-diethylbenzene based on the symmetry). 

This is a relatively simple, non-polar hydrocarbon with no heteroatoms or highly polar functional groups. Comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset:
- **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (heptylbenzene) has a property value of **297.55451593**.
- **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline) has a property value of **-693.84512575**, but this includes a polar -NH2 group.
- **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine) has a property value of **-603.29875988**, but this includes a nitrogen heteroatom.

Since **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is less polar than methylaniline or ethylpyridine but similar in complexity to heptylbenzene (though smaller), its property value should be positive but lower than heptylbenzene. 

### Predicted property value for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1**:  
**Approximately 150.0** (based on interpolation of the given examples).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated estimate based on the trend in the data. If the property is something like "molar refractivity" or "partition coefficient," the value would differ, but the trend holds.)

Iteration: 53
SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 69.4909304372595
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **4-amino-N-sulfonylaniline**, with the following features:
1. An aromatic benzene ring.
2. An amino group (-NH₂) at the para position.
3. A sulfonamide group (-S(=O)₂-NH₂) at the para position relative to the amino group.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules in the Dataset:
1. **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (4-nitroaniline):
   - Property value: **-659.00472518**
   - This has a nitro group (-NO₂) instead of the sulfonamide group. The sulfonamide group is bulkier and more polar than the nitro group, which may influence the property value.

2. **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12** (adenine-like structure):
   - Property value: **-627.8693778**
   - This is a heterocyclic compound with multiple nitrogens, showing that nitrogen-rich structures tend to have negative property values.

3. **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** (target molecule):
   - The sulfonamide group is more polar and bulky than a nitro group but less polar than some of the highly negative examples (e.g., **CNN** with **-1463.01265095**).
   - The aromatic ring with two substituents (amino and sulfonamide) suggests moderate polarity.

### Trends Observed:
- Molecules with nitro groups (-NO₂) or highly polar groups tend to have negative property values.
- Sulfonamides are polar but not as extreme as some nitro or small nitrogen-rich compounds.
- The presence of an aromatic ring with moderate substituents (like amino + sulfonamide) suggests the property value will be negative but not extremely so.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- 4-nitroaniline (with -NO₂) has a value of **-659.00472518**,
- The sulfonamide group is somewhat similar in polarity but bulkier,

I predict the property value for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** will be slightly less negative than 4-nitroaniline because the sulfonamide group is less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group but still contributes to polarity.

### Final Prediction:
**-550.0** (approximate, based on the trends in the dataset). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the correlation between molecular features and the given values.)

Iteration: 54
SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 547.5977431945522
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34`, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the examples provided. 

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings. It appears to be a **tetracene derivative** (a linear arrangement of four fused benzene rings). The structure can be represented as:

```
      4
    /   \
1---2   3---4
    \   /
      2
```

This is a **tetracene** (also known as naphthacene), which is a larger conjugated system compared to naphthalene (two rings) or anthracene (three rings).

### Observations from Examples:
1. Aromatic systems with more fused rings tend to have higher property values. For example:
   - `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` (a pentacene-like structure) has a value of **1001.07557626**.
   - `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` (a larger PAH) has a value of **1141.3821061**.
   - `c1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32` (a phenanthrene-like structure) has a value of **407.29121336**.

2. The property value increases with the size of the conjugated system (more rings = higher value).

### Prediction:
The given molecule (`c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34`) is a tetracene, which is smaller than the pentacene-like structure (1001.075) but larger than the phenanthrene-like structure (407.291). 

Given the trend, a reasonable estimate would be between **600 and 800**. Comparing to similar-sized structures in the examples, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 750.0** (approximate, based on interpolation of the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molecular polarizability, boiling point, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.) 

Would you like me to refine this further based on additional reasoning?

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 828.0164053794498
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, halogens, and conjugated systems. The molecule in question is:

**Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH)**: These are present on the aromatic rings and likely contribute negatively to the property value (as seen in similar molecules like `Oc1cccc(O)c1` with -840.09).
2. **Aromatic rings and conjugation**: The molecule has two fused aromatic rings (benzofuran-like structure) and an additional aromatic ring, which increases complexity and likely contributes positively.
3. **Carbonyl group (C=O)**: This is part of a cyclic structure and may add to the property value.
4. **Ether linkage (Oc)**: This connects the rings and may have a moderate effect.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl` has a value of 1305.67. This molecule has two aromatic rings, halogens, and a polar group, similar in complexity to our target.
- `Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4` has a value of 1374.40. This is structurally very similar to our target (fused aromatic systems with hydroxyls and a carbonyl).
- `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (simpler dihydroxybenzene) has -840.09, showing how hydroxyls can reduce the value.

### Prediction:
The target molecule is more complex than `Oc1cccc(O)c1` but less halogenated than `OC(...)Cl` examples. It closely resembles `Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4` (1374.40) but with slightly fewer rings and no additional carbonyl outside the fused system. The hydroxyls will reduce the value somewhat.

**Predicted property value: ~1250.0**

### Refined Estimate:
Given the strong similarity to the 1374.40 example but with fewer conjugated/extended features, I'd adjust downward slightly. A reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted value: 1265.75**

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 729.0841049681273
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., P=O, P=S)** tend to contribute significantly to higher property values. For example:
   - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **1430.31351677**.
   - `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **1471.51467951**.
   - `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` has a very high value of **3290.01308369**.

2. **Chlorine atoms** also increase the property value, especially when multiple are present (e.g., polychlorinated aromatics).

3. **Smaller or simpler molecules** (e.g., alkanes like `CCCCC`) have negative or low values.

4. **Functional groups like amides, esters, and nitro groups** can contribute to intermediate or higher values depending on their context.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, which has:
- A **phosphate group (P=O)** with an amide linkage (`NC(C)=O`).
- A **thioether (S-C)** group.
- No chlorine atoms or aromatic rings.

Given the presence of the **P=O** group and the **amide**, this molecule is likely to have a **moderately high property value**, but not as high as the heavily substituted phosphorus compounds or polychlorinated aromatics in the examples.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (1471.51) has multiple chlorines and a P=O group.
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (1430.31) is similar but with P=S.
- `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` (3290.01) is much larger and more complex.

Our molecule lacks chlorines and is smaller, so its value should be lower than these but still positive and significant due to the P=O and amide.

### Estimated Value:
Given the trends, I predict the property value for **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** to be in the range of **800–1200**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1050.0** (rounded to a plausible figure based on the examples). 

This is based on:
- The presence of P=O (contributing ~1000–1500 in other examples).
- The absence of chlorines or aromatic rings (reducing the value compared to the higher examples).
- The amide group adding some contribution but not as much as heavy substitution. 

Thus, **1050.0** is a balanced estimate.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -1103.5618263338451
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values appear to correspond to molecular properties such as **molecular polarizability** or **molecular dipole moments**, though the exact property isn't explicitly stated. The values are highly dependent on molecular structure, functional groups, and substituents.

For the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (trans-1,2-dichloroethene), we can make an educated prediction based on the following observations from the dataset:

1. **Chlorine substituents** tend to increase the property value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a high value of **1137.59242163**, while `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` has a negative value but still higher than non-chlorinated aromatics).
2. **Small, symmetric molecules** with halogens (like `CCBr` = **-912.80264425**) can have very negative values, but conjugated systems (like `Cl\C=C/Cl`) may behave differently due to π-electron effects.
3. The **trans-configuration** of `Cl\C=C/Cl` leads to a net dipole moment cancellation (unlike the cis-form), but polarizability still plays a role.

### Prediction:
Given the symmetry and chlorine contributions, a reasonable estimate for `Cl\C=C/Cl` would be in the range of **-200 to -400**. 

A more precise guess, based on interpolation with similar small chlorinated molecules (e.g., `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` = **-668.18433317**, `CCBr` = **-912.80264425**), would be:

**Predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl: -350.0**  

*(This is an approximate estimate; the actual value would require computational or experimental verification.)*

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -1016.3934041463323
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and aromaticity. The molecule in question, **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), is a simple aromatic heterocycle with a nitrogen atom in the ring.

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Simple aromatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have negative or small positive values unless they have large substituents or extended conjugation.
   - Example: `CNc1ccccc1` (N-methylaniline) has a value of **-675.04761507**.
   - Example: `Cc1cccc2c1Cc3ccccc32` (methyl-substituted fluorene-like structure) has a value of **321.60174129**, likely due to increased conjugation and rigidity.
2. **Heterocycles with nitrogen** (e.g., pyridine-like structures) in the examples show:
   - `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (a complex purine-like structure) has a value of **-373.53114458**.
   - `Cc1ncnc2nccnc12` (a methylated purine-like structure) has a value of **-422.54953669**.
3. **Pyridine (c1ccncc1)** is simpler than these examples, with no substituents or extended conjugation. It is less complex than the purine-like structures but more polarizable than simple benzene due to the nitrogen atom.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Simple aromatic systems with heteroatoms (like pyridine) tend to have moderately negative values (e.g., similar to or slightly higher than benzene derivatives).
- The nitrogen in pyridine increases polarity but does not drastically increase the property value compared to larger conjugated systems.

A reasonable estimate for **c1ccncc1** would be in the range of **-500 to -300**. Considering the simplicity of pyridine and the examples of similar-sized heterocycles, a plausible predicted value is:

**Predicted property value: -450.0**  

*(This is an educated guess based on the trend in the data, where simpler aromatic/heterocyclic structures tend toward negative values, and pyridine fits this pattern.)*

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 1708.7496909495048
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property value for the molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23** by analyzing structural features and trends in the data. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Large, complex aromatic systems with heteroatoms (N, O, S, halogens)** tend to have higher positive values (e.g., 1468.445, 1194.229, 545.079, 1767.725).
2. **Smaller aliphatic molecules or simple functional groups** tend to have negative values (e.g., -126.166, -763.943, -1377.093).
3. **Presence of multiple polar groups (e.g., OH, CO, Cl, N)** can lead to intermediate values, but the overall size and conjugation dominate.
4. **Aromatic rings with substitutions (e.g., Cl, NO2, OCH3)** often have values in the mid-range (e.g., -354.794, 158.442, 320.346).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23** has:
- A **large conjugated system** with multiple aromatic rings (benzene, pyridine, and fused rings).
- **Polar functional groups**: hydroxyl (OH), ester (COO), amide (N linked to aromatic), and chlorine (Cl).
- **Heteroatoms (N, O, Cl)** contributing to polarity and conjugation.
- Structural similarity to some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., **Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23** resembles fused aromatic systems with heteroatoms).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule is most similar to **Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23** (part of the structure), which would likely contribute a positive value.
- The **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1** fragment resembles ester-linked aromatic systems, which in the examples have values like **366.613** (for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC**) or **218.803** (for **CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1OC(C)C**).
- The combined system is larger and more conjugated than most examples, suggesting a higher value.

### Predicted Value:
Given the size, conjugation, and polar substitutions, I estimate the property value to be in the range of **800–1200**. A reasonable prediction would be:

**Predicted property value: 1120.5**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data. For precise predictions, computational methods or empirical models would be required.)

Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -732.8605230559834
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values appear to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as ring systems, halogens, and polar substituents. 

For the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), which is a simple linear alcohol with no rings or highly polar substituents beyond the hydroxyl group, we can infer the following:

1. Linear alkanes and simple alcohols in the examples (e.g., **CCCc1ccccc1**, **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**) tend to have negative property values, likely reflecting lower polarity or simpler interactions.
2. The hydroxyl group adds some polarity, but without additional complexity (e.g., rings, halogens, or multiple functional groups), the value is unlikely to be highly positive.
3. Comparing to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cyclooctanol, property = -79.86), which has a ring and a hydroxyl group, **CCCCCO** is simpler and likely has a more negative value.

Given these observations, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCCO** would be in the range of **-200 to -400**. A specific prediction based on the trend could be:

**Predicted property value for CCCCCCO: -320.0**  

This aligns with the trend of simpler, less polar molecules having more negative values in the provided examples.
==================================================
Iteration: 61
SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 1187.6567950509548
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correspond to molecular properties such as **heat of formation**, **Gibbs free energy**, or another quantum-mechanically derived thermodynamic or electronic property (though the exact property is not explicitly named). The values span a wide range, from negative to positive, and are influenced by molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features.

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
The molecule in question is:  
**CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**  

This structure contains:
1. A **thiazine-like ring** (6-membered with S, O, and N) fused to a benzene ring.
2. A **sulfonyl group (S=O)**, which is highly polar and contributes to a positive property value (as seen in other sulfonyl-containing examples).
3. A **carbonyl group (C=O)** attached to an aniline-like moiety (N linked to benzene), which adds polarity and potential resonance stabilization.
4. A **fused aromatic system** (benzene ring), which typically contributes to stability but may not drastically alter the property value.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- **Sulfonyl-containing molecules**:  
  - `CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C` has a value of **2384.20971322**.  
  - `CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of **1526.97726198**.  
  These suggest that sulfonyl/sulfur-containing groups contribute to large positive values.  

- **Aromatic systems with polar groups**:  
  - `O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` has a value of **721.95583494**.  
  - `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3` has a value of **313.30365995**.  
  These indicate that fused aromatic systems with polar substituents tend to have moderately positive values.  

- **Combined sulfonyl + carbonyl + aromatic**:  
  The given molecule combines these features, so we expect a **positive value in the range of 500–1500**, leaning toward the higher end due to the sulfonyl group.

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the structural features and the trends in the examples, the predicted property value for **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1** is:  

**≈ 1250.0**  

This estimate balances the contributions from the sulfonyl group (strongly positive), the carbonyl-amine-aromatic system (moderately positive), and the fused ring system.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. If the property is something like "molar refractivity" or "dipole moment," the reasoning would differ.)

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 1326.1894871760944
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values appear to correspond to **molecular energies** (likely calculated at a certain level of theory, such as DFT or semi-empirical methods). The values span a wide range, from negative to positive, and seem to correlate with molecular size, functional groups, and structural complexity.

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
The molecule in question is:  
**COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**

Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic system** (benzene ring with a nitro group: `c2ccccc2N(=O)=O`).
2. **Two ester groups** (`COC(=O)` and `C(=O)OC`).
3. **Heterocyclic nitrogen** (in a five-membered ring with a double bond: `NC(=C)`).
4. **Moderate size** (larger than simple aromatics but smaller than highly extended polycyclic systems).

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups and aromatic systems (e.g., `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`) have values around **-570**.
- Molecules with ester groups (e.g., `CCCCC(=O)OC`) have values around **-584**.
- Larger fused-ring systems (e.g., `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13`) have positive values (~**146**).
- The presence of multiple functional groups (esters, nitro, aromatic) suggests a value between **-500 and +500**, but likely on the higher side due to the nitro group and ester contributions.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural complexity and functional groups, the predicted property value for **COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C** is approximately:  
**-200 to +200**  

However, looking more closely at similar-sized molecules with nitro and ester groups, a refined estimate is:  
**~ -150 to +150**  

But since the molecule is larger than simple nitroaromatics and has multiple functional groups, a plausible specific prediction is:  
**87.45239122**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property or computational method, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. The true value would require computational verification.)

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -397.7476355036811
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structure and compare it with the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a cyclic imide with two carbonyl groups (C=O) attached to a nitrogen (N) and a cyclopropane ring (CC1). The formula can be rewritten as:
```
   O
  ║
   N
  ║
   C       O
  ∕ ﹨     ║
 C   C──C
  ﹨  ∕   ║
   N     O
   ║
   O
```
Key features:
1. **Cyclic imide core** (similar to succinimide derivatives but with a cyclopropane ring).
2. **Two highly polar C=O groups** (contributing to a more negative property value).
3. **Compact, strained cyclopropane ring** (may slightly increase the property value compared to linear analogs).

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Similar polar/cyclic molecules**:
  - `c1ccncc1` (pyridine, property = -1016.39): Less polar but cyclic.
  - `C1CCCCC1` (cyclohexane, property = -532.22): Nonpolar cyclic.
  - `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (cyclic polyol, property = -546.78): Highly polar cyclic.
- **Imides/carbonyl-rich molecules**:
  - `CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (steroid-like, property = 2469.09): Much larger but carbonyl-rich.
  - `ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (polar/cyclic, property = 1078.96): Closer in polarity but larger.

### Prediction:
Given the **small size**, **high polarity**, and **strained ring**, the property value should be **moderately negative** (similar to cyclic polar molecules but less extreme than aromatic N-heterocycles). A reasonable estimate is between **-500 and -700**.

#### Final Prediction:
**-618.42**  
*(This is an educated guess based on the balance of polarity, cyclic strain, and comparison to the examples.)*

Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: -1159.859892071912
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and atomic composition. The property appears to be a calculated or measured molecular property (possibly a molecular weight, energy, or other physicochemical property), but the exact nature isn't explicitly stated. 

Let's analyze the given molecule **ClCC** (chloroethane, C₂H₅Cl) in the context of the examples:

1. **Simple hydrocarbons**: 
   - **CCCCC** (pentane) has a value of **-778.7916832**.
   - **C1CC=CC1** (cyclopentene) has a value of **-890.07593983**.
   - **CCC1CCCCC1** (propylcyclohexane) has a value of **-139.98808124**.

2. **Chlorinated compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) has a value of **-752.09833096**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (tetrachlorobenzene) has a value of **-141.41129961**.
   - **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl** (a complex chlorinated hydrocarbon) has a value of **1591.5385025**.

3. **Small chlorinated molecules**:
   - **ClCC** is simpler than chlorobenzene and most other chlorinated examples. Its value should be more negative (lower) than chlorobenzene (-752.09833096) but less negative than very small non-chlorinated hydrocarbons like **CC#N** (-1490.40118859).

Given that **ClCC** is a small, lightly chlorinated molecule, its property value is likely in the range of **-1000 to -500**. Comparing it to similar-sized molecules:
- **CCCCC** (pentane, 5 carbons) is **-778.7916832**.
- **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene, 6 carbons + Cl) is **-752.09833096**.
- **CC#N** (acetonitrile, 2 carbons + N) is **-1490.40118859**.

Since **ClCC** is smaller than chlorobenzene but has a chlorine atom (which seems to reduce the magnitude of negative values compared to pure hydrocarbons), a reasonable estimate is slightly more negative than pentane but less negative than acetonitrile. 

**Predicted property value for ClCC: -950.0** (approximate, based on interpolation from the given examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being calculated, this is an educated guess based on trends in the data. If the property is molecular weight, this would be incorrect, as the molecular weight of ClCC is ~64.5 g/mol, which doesn't match the scale of the given values. The property is likely something like heat of formation or energy in atomic units, but the exact value cannot be precisely determined without more context.)

Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: -23.323601487060564
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorine (Cl) Substituents**: 
   - Molecules with multiple Cl atoms tend to have higher property values (e.g., `ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)...` has a value of **2541.90**, while `ClCC(Cl)Cl` has **-734.54**). The trend suggests that Cl-rich aromatic systems (e.g., polychlorinated benzene) have positive values, while aliphatic Cl-rich systems are negative.
   - The molecule `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (a trichlorinated biphenyl) has a value of **526.91**, indicating aromatic Cl contributes positively.

2. **Aromatic Systems with Heteroatoms**:
   - `c1ccc2c(c1)sc3ccccc23` (a thiophene fused to benzene) has **364.10**, showing fused aromatic systems with heteroatoms (S) increase the value.
   - `c2ccc1ocnc1c2` (a fused oxazole) has **-637.88**, suggesting that N and O in fused systems can decrease the value unless balanced by other factors (e.g., Cl).

3. **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (Trichloromethyl Group)**:
   - The group `C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` appears in `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`, which has a high value of **1296.04**. This suggests the trichloromethyl group significantly increases the property value when attached to an aromatic system.

4. **Pyridine (n1) vs. Benzene**:
   - Pyridine (`n1`) is present in the target molecule. In `c2ccc1ocnc1c2`, the pyridine-like N contributes negatively, but the presence of Cl may counteract this.

### Target Molecule: **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**
- **Structure**: A chloropyridine (`Clc1ccccn1`) with a `C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` group attached.
- **Features**:
  - Aromatic ring with Cl and N (pyridine).
  - Trichloromethyl group (`C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`), which strongly increases the value (as seen in the example with **1296.04**).
  - The pyridine N might slightly reduce the value, but the Cl substituents dominate.

### Prediction:
Given the strong positive contribution of `C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` and the aromatic Cl, the value should be **similar to or slightly lower than 1296.04** (due to the pyridine N). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1100.0**  
*(This is an approximate interpolation based on the examples, accounting for the trichloromethyl group's dominance and the pyridine's slight reduction.)*  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends.)*

Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -552.8880674389009
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (which is 2-hexanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (3-heptanol): Property value = **-326.43130683**
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (1-phenylethanol): Property value = **-517.52927905**
   - **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol): Property value = **-567.08266857**
   - **CCC(CC)CO** (3-methyl-1-pentanol): Property value = **-551.08570272**

   Alcohols generally have negative property values, and the value seems to depend on the size and branching of the molecule. 

2. **Branching Effects**:
   - Branching tends to make the property value less negative (closer to zero) compared to linear chains. For example:
     - **CCC(C)CCO** (-567.08) vs. **CCC(CC)CO** (-551.09): The more branched isomer has a slightly higher (less negative) value.

3. **Position of the OH Group**:
   - Secondary alcohols (e.g., **CCCC(O)CCC**) have less negative values than primary alcohols (e.g., **CCC(C)CCO**).

### Prediction for **CCCCC(C)O** (2-hexanol):
- This is a **secondary alcohol** with a **6-carbon chain** and **one branch (methyl group)**.
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - **CCCC(O)CCC** (3-heptanol, 7 carbons, secondary OH): **-326.43**
  - **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol, 6 carbons, primary OH): **-567.08**
  - **CCC(CC)CO** (3-methyl-1-pentanol, 6 carbons, primary OH): **-551.09**

Since **2-hexanol** is a secondary alcohol with 6 carbons, its value should be less negative than the primary alcohols but more negative than the 7-carbon secondary alcohol. 

Given the trend, a reasonable estimate is between **-400 and -500**. Interpolating from the examples, I predict:

### Predicted Property Value for **CCCCC(C)O**: **-450.0**

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For precise predictions, a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model or additional data would be needed.)

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -201.66266552874905
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular weight, polarity, and possibly other structural features like halogenation (Cl, Br), aromaticity, and functional groups. 

Let's analyze the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene):

1. **Molecular weight**: 
   - Bromine (Br) has an atomic mass of ~80.
   - Carbon (C) has an atomic mass of ~12.
   - Hydrogen (H) has an atomic mass of ~1.
   - The molecular formula is C6H4Br2.
   - Calculated molecular weight: (6 × 12) + (4 × 1) + (2 × 80) = 72 + 4 + 160 = 236.

2. **Comparison with similar molecules**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene) has a property value of 323.3430465. Chlorine is less heavy than bromine, so the property value for the dibromo analog should be higher.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (a dichlorobiphenyl) has a property value of 323.3430465, which is similar to the dichlorobenzene case, suggesting that aromaticity and halogenation play a role.
   - **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** (a heavily chlorinated molecule) has a high property value of 1150.03243706, indicating that more halogens increase the property value.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Since bromine is heavier than chlorine, the property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** should be higher than that of **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (323.3430465) but not as high as heavily halogenated molecules like **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2**.
   - A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **500–700**, considering the two bromines and aromaticity.

Given the examples, a plausible predicted property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is:  
**650.0** (approximate, based on trends in the data).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molecular polarizability, boiling point, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 1135.074032727647
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values tend to increase with the size and complexity of the molecule, particularly with the number of heavy atoms (like carbon, chlorine, etc.) and the presence of aromatic systems or conjugated structures. 

The molecule in question is:
**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**

This is a polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure with two benzene rings connected by a single bond, and each ring is heavily substituted with chlorine atoms. Comparing this to the given examples:

1. **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 1959.39696348): This is a similar but more heavily chlorinated biphenyl (hexachloro-substituted on each ring). The property value is very high due to the large number of chlorine atoms and the aromatic system.

2. The molecule we are predicting has fewer chlorine atoms (5 chlorines total) compared to the above example (12 chlorines). 

3. Another relevant example is **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** (property = 1138.86371719), which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with a large conjugated system but no chlorine substituents. The property value is high due to the extensive conjugation.

Given these comparisons, the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl** is smaller and less chlorinated than the first example but still has significant aromatic conjugation and chlorine substitution. 

### Prediction:
The property value should be between the PAH example (~1138) and the heavily chlorinated biphenyl (~1959). A reasonable estimate would be closer to the lower end due to fewer chlorines but still significant conjugation. 

**Predicted property value: ~1500.0** (specific estimate: **1500.0**). 

This is an approximate interpolation based on the given examples. For a precise value, computational methods would be needed, but this is a reasonable ballpark estimate given the trend in the data.

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 2318.811887738143
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, it appears that the property values are influenced by molecular complexity, functional groups, and molecular weight. The molecule in question is:

**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

This molecule has a central phosphate group (P=O) connected to two aromatic rings (one with a methyl group and another with a methyl-substituted phenyl group) and a third aromatic ring (toluene-like). The presence of multiple aromatic rings, a phosphate group, and methyl substituents suggests significant molecular complexity and polarity.

Comparing to similar complex molecules in the examples:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and polar groups (e.g., P=O, O-linkages) tend to have property values in the range of **1000–2500**.
- For instance, `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (with P=S, aromatic rings, and carbonyls) has a value of **3143.03423032**.
- `COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (with aromatic rings and polar groups) has a value of **1334.27990245**.

Given the structural similarity (aromatic rings + phosphate + methyl groups) but slightly less complexity than the highest examples, a reasonable prediction for this molecule would be in the **middle range** of the observed values. 

### Predicted property value: **1800.0** (estimated based on structural trends in the data). 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples, as the exact property is not explicitly defined in the question. The value likely corresponds to a computed or measured physicochemical property such as molecular polarizability or a similar descriptor.)

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 941.3418067120207
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**: Often associated with negative property values (e.g., -298.268, -570.054, -659.005).
   - **Halogens (Cl, Br, I)**: Generally increase the property value, especially when multiple halogens are present (e.g., 939.067 for hexachlorobenzene, 1343.673 for polychlorinated biphenyl).
   - **Trifluoromethyl (CF3)**: The presence of CF3 tends to increase the property value (e.g., 1109.581 for a molecule with CF3 and other halogens).
   - **Aromatic rings**: Neutral or slightly positive contributions unless paired with strongly electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro groups).
   - **Carbonyl groups (C=O)**: Can increase the property value, especially in complex structures (e.g., 2689.769 for a steroid-like molecule with multiple carbonyls).

2. **Molecular Size and Complexity**:
   - Larger, more complex molecules (e.g., steroids, polycyclic aromatics) tend to have higher property values (e.g., 3626.858, 2689.769).
   - Small, simple molecules (e.g., CCCC, CBr) have very negative values.

3. **Specific Examples**:
   - **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2**: Highly chlorinated, property = 1150.032.
   - **NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl**: Complex with sulfonamide and chlorine, property = 1455.771.
   - **CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C**: Contains CF3 and sulfonamide, property = 1109.581.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**  
- **Trifluoromethyl (CF3)**: Strongly electron-withdrawing, likely increases the property value.
- **Aromatic ring with CF3 and nitrogen**: Neutral to slightly positive contribution.
- **Chlorine substituents (CCl and Cl)**: Two chlorines, which will increase the value.
- **Carbonyl group (C=O)**: Increases the value.
- **Heterocycle with N and Cl**: Similar to complex examples with halogens and nitrogens (e.g., 390.793 for a chlorinated heterocycle).

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The molecule is somewhat similar to **CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C** (property = 1109.581), which has CF3, carbonyl, and aromatic features.
- It is also comparable to **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** (property = 1150.032), which has multiple chlorines and aromatic rings.
- The presence of the heterocycle with Cl and C=O adds complexity, similar to **NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl** (property = 1455.771), though our molecule is less complex.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above, the molecule has:
- A CF3 group (~similar to 1109.581 example).
- Two chlorines (~similar to 1150.032 example).
- A carbonyl and heterocycle (~adds some complexity).

A reasonable estimate would be between **1100 and 1300**. Given the specific features, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 1220.45**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples provided, as no explicit formula or trend is given. The actual value may vary slightly depending on finer structural details.)

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -520.2358011681483
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - Molecules with **nitro groups (N(=O)=O)** tend to have moderate to high positive property values (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has -532.695, but this is an outlier; others like `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` with nitro-like groups have higher values).
   - **Methoxy groups (OCH3)** often appear in molecules with negative or moderately positive values (e.g., `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` has -127.995).
   - **Aromatic rings** with electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro) tend to increase the property value compared to plain aromatics (e.g., `c1ccccc1O` has -896.617, while nitro-aromatics are less negative or positive).

2. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (dinitrobenzene): -532.695
   - `c1ccccc1O` (phenol): -896.617
   - `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` (complex nitro-aromatic): 915.778
   - The presence of a **methoxy group** and a **nitro group** on an aromatic ring is somewhat similar to the target molecule.

3. **Additive Effects**:
   - The nitro group is likely to increase the property value compared to phenol, but the methoxy group may offset this slightly (electron-donating effect).
   - The molecule is less complex than some high-value examples (e.g., polycyclic or multi-functionalized), so the value may not be extremely high.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (methoxy-nitrobenzene) is likely to be **moderately positive**, similar to other nitro-aromatics but not as high as highly conjugated or polycyclic systems. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -200.0**  
*(This is based on interpolation between simpler nitro-aromatics and methoxy-aromatics in the dataset.)*

---
**Note**: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., energy, polarizability, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. The value could vary if the property has nonlinear dependencies. For higher accuracy, a model trained on more data would be needed.

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 1721.7320216777491
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, halogen substitution (especially chlorine and bromine), and structural features like rings and branching. The molecule in question is highly chlorinated and has a complex polycyclic structure, which likely contributes to a high property value.

Here’s the reasoning:
1. **High halogen content (Cl)**: Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms (e.g., `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl`) tend to have high positive values (e.g., 700.19704023). The given molecule has **9 chlorine atoms**, which is even more than in the example.
2. **Polycyclic structure**: Molecules with fused rings (e.g., `Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13`) also show high values (e.g., 1178.97712746). The given molecule has a complex tricyclic structure, further increasing the value.
3. **Comparison to similar examples**:
   - `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (6 Cl, monocyclic): 700.19704023
   - `Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13` (no Cl, polycyclic): 1178.97712746
   - The given molecule combines both features (9 Cl + polycyclic), so the value should be higher than these.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for:
`ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl`

is likely in the range of **1500 to 2000**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1785.42**  

This aligns with the trend of high halogenation and structural complexity leading to large positive values in the given examples.

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -966.9541574898656
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and molecular weight, though the exact nature of the property (e.g., energy, polarizability, etc.) isn't explicitly stated. 

Let's analyze the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate, with the structure CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-O-CH=O):

1. **Functional groups**: It contains an ester group (-O-CH=O) and an alkyl chain (propyl group). Esthers and aldehydes/ketones in the examples tend to have moderately negative or positive values depending on additional complexity.
2. **Molecular size**: It is a small molecule (5 non-hydrogen atoms in the main chain), similar to some of the smaller examples like **C1CCCCCC1** (-321.76) or **CC#N** (-1490.40), but with polar functional groups.
3. **Comparison to similar examples**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** has a value of -210.61. This is a larger molecule with an ester and an aromatic ring, but the ester group is similar.
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2** has a value of 1210.67, but this is much larger and more complex.
   - **CC(=O)CCC1C(=O)N(N(C1=O)c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** has a value of 1516.53, but this is far more complex.

Given that **CCCOC=O** is a small ester with no aromaticity or additional functional groups, its value should be moderately negative but not as extreme as very small or highly polar molecules like **CC#N** (-1490.40) or **NC(=O)N** (-1466.04). 

A reasonable estimate, based on the trend for small polar molecules, would be between **-500 and -200**. 

Looking at **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (-210.61), which is larger but has some similarities, and smaller molecules like **CCCI** (-532.24), I would predict the property for **CCCOC=O** to be approximately **-400.0**.

**Predicted property value: -400.0** (estimated based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 715.6735606133095
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chain Length and Saturation**: 
   - Longer carbon chains (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**) tend to have positive property values (e.g., 297.55). 
   - Unsaturated or branched chains (e.g., **CCCCC(CC)C=O**) tend to have negative values (e.g., -195.59).
   - Fully saturated linear chains (e.g., **CC**) have very negative values (e.g., -1374.06).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Esters (e.g., **COCC(=O)N...**) often have positive values (e.g., 893.24).
   - Alcohols (e.g., **Oc1ccc(O)cc1**) tend to have negative values (e.g., -840.09).
   - Carbonyl groups (e.g., **C=O**) can contribute positively or negatively depending on context.

3. **Aromaticity**:
   - Aromatic rings (e.g., **c1ccc2ccccc2c1**) often have positive values (e.g., -189.01 to 229.39), but substitutions (e.g., halogens) can significantly alter this.

4. **Halogens**:
   - Halogen substitutions (e.g., Cl, Br) often increase the property value (e.g., **Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br** = 554.85).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** is a linear saturated fatty acid ester:
- **Long saturated carbon chain (CCCCCCCCC)**: Likely contributes positively (similar to **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** = 297.55).
- **Ester group (C(=O)OCC)**: Likely contributes positively (similar to other esters in the examples).

Given the long chain and ester group, the property value should be significantly positive. Comparing to similar structures:
- **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (7-carbon chain + aromatic) = 297.55.
- **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** (10-carbon chain + ester) should be higher due to the longer chain and ester functionality.

### Prediction:
Considering the trends, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC** is **~500 to ~800**. Given the examples, a specific predicted value is **650.0**.

### Final Answer:
**650.0**

Iteration: 75
SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 888.9901046050626
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a phenol group (**Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1**) linked via an amide (**C(=O)N**) to a chlorinated nitrobenzene (**N(=O)=O**). 
2. **Substituents**: 
   - Two chlorine atoms (one on each aromatic ring).
   - A nitro group (**N(=O)=O**), which is highly polar and electron-withdrawing.
   - A carbonyl group (**C=O**) in the amide linkage.
3. **Size and Complexity**: The molecule is moderately large with two aromatic rings, polar substituents, and conjugated systems.

### Comparison to Examples:
- **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property: **-541.87**): This is a simple chloronitrobenzene. Our molecule is larger and has additional polar groups (phenol and amide), which would likely increase the property value.
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property: **915.78**): This has a similar amide-linked aromatic system but lacks a nitro group. The nitro group in our molecule is more polar and would likely increase the property further.
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property: **-531.93**): This is just chlorophenol, much smaller and less polar than our target molecule.
- **CC2Nc1cc(Cl)c(cc1C(=O)N2c3ccccc3C)S(N)(=O)=O** (property: **2053.92**): This has a sulfonamide and amide, similar in complexity. Our molecule lacks the sulfonamide but has a nitro group, which is similarly polar.

### Estimation:
Given the above comparisons:
1. The nitro group and amide linkage add significant polarity and size, pushing the property value higher than simple chlorinated aromatics.
2. The closest analog is **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property: **915.78**), but our molecule has a nitro group instead of a dimethylamide, which is more polar. This suggests a higher value.
3. However, it is not as complex as **CC2Nc1cc(Cl)c(cc1C(=O)N2c3ccccc3C)S(N)(=O)=O** (property: **2053.92**), so the value should be between these two.

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate is **~1200 to 1500**. Given the examples, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 1420.50**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the given data. For precise predictions, computational methods or more data would be needed.)

Iteration: 76
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 3879.6002793018974
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and the presence of certain substituents (e.g., halogens like Cl, aromatic systems, and heteroatoms like S, P, or N). The property values tend to increase with larger, more complex structures, especially those with multiple aromatic rings, heteroatoms, or heavy substituents (e.g., Cl, S, P).

The molecule to predict is:  
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**

### Analysis of the molecule:
1. **Structural features**:
   - Two **phosphate groups (P(=S)(OC)OC)**, which are bulky and contain sulfur (S) and phosphorus (P).
   - Two **aromatic rings** linked by a **thioether (S)** bridge.
   - Multiple **oxygen substituents (OCH3, O-aryl)**.
   - The molecule is **symmetrical**, doubling the contribution of the phosphate and aromatic systems.

2. **Comparison to training examples**:
   - The molecule is most similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 2780.5857532), which also has a phosphate group, sulfur, and aromatic rings. However, the molecule here has **two phosphate groups** and **two aromatic systems**, making it even larger.
   - Another comparable example is **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (property = 1140.11081053), which has multiple aromatic rings and heavy Cl substituents but lacks P or S. The presence of P and S here likely increases the property value further.
   - The **symmetry and doubling of functional groups** suggest an additive or multiplicative effect.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Given the size and complexity, the property value should be **higher than 2780.5857532** (the phosphate-containing example) but not excessively so since the additional aromatic system and sulfur bridge are partially offset by the lack of Cl substituents (which contribute significantly in other examples).
   - A reasonable estimate would be **~3500 to 4000**, considering the doubled phosphate groups and aromatic systems.

However, looking more carefully at the trend:
- The highest value in the training set is **2780.5857532** for **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**.
- The molecule here is even larger and more complex, so a value **significantly higher than 2780** is expected.
- A conservative estimate would be **~4000**, but given the logarithmic or nonlinear scaling observed in some examples, it could be higher.

### Final predicted property value:  
**3850.0** (approximate, based on structural complexity and comparison to training examples).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted or the computational method used to derive these values, this is an educated guess based on molecular features.)*

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -686.3932628115047
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - Nitro group (**N(=O)=O**) tends to decrease the property value (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has a value of `-567.53556067`).
   - Hydroxy group (**OH**) can have varying effects depending on the rest of the molecule, but often reduces the property value when combined with other electronegative groups.
   - Aromatic rings with simple substituents (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Br)c1` has `-376.3585208`) tend to have negative or low positive values.

2. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` has a value of `600.17641483`, but this is a larger, more complex molecule with multiple substituents.
   - `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` has `-619.03469019`, showing that an aromatic ring with both hydroxy and nitro-like groups (here, amide and hydroxy) can lead to negative values.
   - `Nc1cccc(Cl)c1` has `-668.18433317`, indicating that an aromatic ring with an amino group and a halogen can result in strongly negative values.

3. **Combination of OH and NO2**:
   - The molecule `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` is a phenol derivative with a nitro group at the para position. Given that nitro groups are strongly electron-withdrawing and hydroxy groups are electron-donating, this combination may lead to a moderately negative property value.

### Prediction:
Given the examples, the presence of both **OH** and **N(=O)=O** on an aromatic ring (especially in the para position) is likely to result in a negative property value. Comparing to similar molecules:
- `Nc1cccc(Cl)c1` has `-668.18433317` (amino + chloro).
- `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` has `-619.03469019` (amide + hydroxy).
- `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has `-567.53556067` (methyl + nitro).

The molecule `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` is simpler than some of these but has both hydroxy and nitro groups, which may balance out somewhat. A reasonable estimate would be slightly less negative than `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` but more negative than `Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-500.0** (approximate, based on trends in the given data). 

This is an educated guess given the limited examples, but it aligns with the observed effects of nitro and hydroxy groups on aromatic systems in the provided data. For a more precise prediction, additional examples or a model would be needed.

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 2650.527271930838
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, it appears that the property in question is likely related to the molecular weight or a similar cumulative property that increases with the size and complexity of the molecule. The values for larger, more complex molecules are higher, while smaller or simpler molecules have lower (sometimes negative) values. 

The molecule in question is a large, complex carbohydrate (a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide derivative) with multiple oxygen atoms and hydroxyl groups. Its structure is:

**OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O**

Breaking this down:
- It has 18 carbon atoms (C).
- It has multiple oxygen atoms (O) in the form of hydroxyl groups (OH) and ether linkages (OC).
- It has hydrogen atoms (H) attached to these carbons and oxygens.

Given the examples:
- Large hydrocarbons like C24H50 (CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC) have high values (~3640).
- Complex molecules with many heteroatoms (O, N, etc.) and rings also have high values (e.g., 2469 for a steroid derivative).
- Small or simple molecules (e.g., CBr, CCC#N) have low or negative values.

This molecule is very large and oxygen-rich, similar in complexity to some of the highest-valued examples (e.g., the steroid derivative with MW ~2469). However, it lacks some of the dense ring systems or heavy atoms (Cl, Br, etc.) that further increase the property in some examples. 

Given this, I would predict its property value to be in the high range, similar to other large, oxygenated molecules. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: ~2500.0** 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being calculated, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. If the property is molecular weight, the exact MW of this molecule would need to be calculated by summing atomic weights, but the value seems to scale with size/complexity.)

Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -1227.0198015913538
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as branching, conjugation, and presence of heteroatoms. 

For the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), which is a simple linear alkyne with no additional functional groups or complex features, we can observe the following trends from the examples:

1. Simple hydrocarbons with minimal branching or functional groups tend to have moderate to low property values (e.g., `CCCC(=O)C` has -841.68937982, `CCCCCC=O` has -594.91558299, `CCCCCCCCC=C` has 109.09180543).
2. The presence of a triple bond (as in `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N`, which has -627.11318187) tends to lower the property value compared to similar molecules without the triple bond, but this also depends on other structural features.

Since **CCC#C** is a very simple alkyne with no other functional groups or complexity, we can infer that its property value would likely be in the low to moderate negative range, similar to other small hydrocarbons or alkynes in the dataset. 

Comparing to `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (-627.11318187), which has two nitrile groups and an aromatic ring, **CCC#C** is much simpler, so its value should be less negative. 

A reasonable prediction for **CCC#C** would be around **-300.0**, as it is simpler than most of the examples but still contains a triple bond, which tends to reduce the property value. 

### Predicted property value for **CCC#C**:  
**-300.0** (estimated based on trends in the given data).

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 1972.1855527185753
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** by analyzing structural features and trends in the data.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P=S) Group**:  
   - Molecules with **P(=S)** groups tend to have high property values (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** → **2780.5857532**).  
   - The presence of **P=S** seems to contribute significantly to the property value.

2. **Aromatic Chlorine Substitution**:  
   - Multiple **Cl** substitutions on an aromatic ring (e.g., **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** → **1137.59242163**) also increase the property value.  
   - Here, the molecule has **three Cl atoms** on the aromatic ring, which is a contributing factor.

3. **Ethoxy (CCO) and Alkyl Groups**:  
   - The **CCOP(=S)(CC)** fragment is similar to **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** (→ **2314.84417564**), but with fewer substituents.  
   - The **CC** (ethyl) group instead of longer chains may slightly reduce the value compared to bulkier analogs.

4. **Combined Effects**:  
   - The molecule has both **P=S** and **Cl-substituted aromatic rings**, which are high-contributing features.  
   - However, it lacks additional high-contributing groups (e.g., **C=O**, **Br**, or **NO₂**), so the value may not be as extreme as the highest examples.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (2780.5857532) but with fewer substituents and a simpler structure, I estimate the property value for **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** to be in the range of **1500–2000**.  

A more precise estimate, considering the trends, would be:  
**Predicted Property Value: ~1800.0**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molecular weight, polarizability, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)  

Would you like me to refine this further based on additional reasoning?

Iteration: 81
SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -636.0997601778595
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse set of molecules and their corresponding property values, I can attempt to identify patterns or trends that might help predict the property for the new molecule: **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**.

### Observations from the Data:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic systems like benzene (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) with substituents often have negative property values (e.g., `-665.66594426` for `Nc1ccccc1Cl`).
   - Larger or more complex aromatic systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatics) tend to have positive values (e.g., `1001.07557626` for `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12`).

2. **Heteroaromatics**:
   - Nitrogen-containing heteroaromatics (e.g., pyridine, pyrimidine) often have values around small positives or negatives. For example:
     - `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` has `113.87985749`.
     - `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` has `-548.851673`.

3. **Functional Groups**:
   - Carbonyl groups (`C=O`) in non-aromatic contexts often reduce the property value (e.g., `-315.37873264` for `CCOC(=O)CC(=O)OCC`).
   - Carbonyls in aromatic or conjugated systems (e.g., amides) can lead to more positive values (e.g., `180.85104524` for `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`).
   - The `NN` (hydrazine) group is not directly represented in the examples, but nitrogen-rich groups often contribute to more positive or less negative values.

4. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `Cl`, `Br`, `F`) tend to make the property more negative (e.g., `-548.53598718` for `Clc1ccccc1Cl`).
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., `OCH3`, `NH2`) can vary but often lead to less negative values.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, which is a pyridine ring (`c1nccc`) with a substituent `C(=O)NN` (a carbonyl attached to a hydrazine group).

- The pyridine ring is a nitrogen-containing heteroaromatic, which from the examples tends to give small positive or negative values.
- The `C(=O)NN` group is electron-withdrawing due to the carbonyl and has additional nitrogens, which may push the value toward the positive side.
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` (a complex nitrogen-rich heterocycle with carbonyl) has `-548.851673`.
  - `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (an amide with aromatic system) has `180.85104524`.

Given that the target molecule is less complex than the second example but has a similar carbonyl-nitrogen motif, I would expect the property value to be in the small-to-moderate positive range.

### Prediction:
Considering the above, a reasonable estimate for **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1** would be around **150 to 250**. 

Given the examples, I'll predict:  
**Predicted property value: 210.0**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples and trends observed. For precise predictions, computational methods or more data would be needed.)

Iteration: 82
SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 3290.0130836912012
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse range of molecular structures and their corresponding property values in the provided examples, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule:

**CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Contributions**:
   - **Phosphorothioate (P(=S))**: Present in `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1` with a value of **1207.75159949**. This group tends to contribute significantly to the property value.
   - **Amide (C(=O)N)**: Present in many molecules, e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` with a value of **-767.85679824**, but the context matters (e.g., cyclic vs. acyclic).
   - **Thioether (SCC)**: Present in `CCS` with a value of **-1098.02698439**, but this is a very simple molecule.
   - **Cyclic structures**: Cyclic amines (e.g., `N1CCCCC1`) appear in other examples, but their contributions vary widely depending on substituents.

2. **Additivity and Interactions**:
   - The property does not appear to be strictly additive, as interactions between functional groups and the overall molecular framework play a significant role.
   - For example, `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` has a value of **-160.83235696**, while `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` has **325.8614354**, showing that subtle changes (e.g., Cl substitution pattern) can drastically affect the property.

3. **Size and Complexity**:
   - Larger, more complex molecules tend to have higher absolute property values, especially if they contain multiple functional groups or heavy atoms (e.g., `ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl` has **1591.5385025**).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` contains:
- Two **P(=S)** groups (one explicitly, one as part of the phosphorothioate).
- An **amide (C(=O)N)** linked to a cyclohexyl ring (`N1CCCCC1`).
- **Thioether (SCC)** linkage.
- Alkyl chains (`OCCC`, `CCCC`).

Given the presence of the phosphorothioate group (which in the example contributes ~1200) and the amide + cyclic amine (which could contribute negatively or positively depending on context), the property value is likely to be large and positive. The additional alkyl chains and thioether may moderate this somewhat.

### Comparison to Closest Examples:
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1`: **1207.75159949** (phosphorothioate + nitro + aromatic).
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2`: **915.77754059** (amide + aromatic + ether).
- `CC(C)=CC3C(C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc1ccccc1)c2)C3(C)C`: **1998.40611728** (complex ester + aromatic).

The target molecule is less aromatic but has more alkyl and thioether components, which may reduce the property compared to highly aromatic examples. However, the phosphorothioate and amide groups are likely dominant.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, a reasonable estimate would be between **1000 and 1500**. Splitting the difference and considering the phosphorothioate's dominance, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 1250.0** (rounded to one decimal place for simplicity). 

This is based on the high contribution from the P(=S) group (~1200) with additional moderate contributions from the amide and cyclic amine.
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -147.41229893186997
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values tend to correlate with the size and complexity of the molecule, as well as the presence of functional groups, halogens, and other substituents. 

For the molecule `CCCCCCCC` (octane), which is a simple linear alkane with no functional groups or substituents, we can compare it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. `C/C1CCCCC1\C` (a cyclohexane derivative with a methyl group) has a property value of `-193.58006846`.
2. `CCCCCCCO` (heptanol) has a property value of `-311.94093355`.
3. `CCC(C)C` (branched alkane) is not directly in the dataset, but simpler alkanes like `CC(C)CCO` (branched alcohol) have values like `-793.53942918`.

Since `CCCCCCCC` is a larger linear alkane than `C/C1CCCCC1\C` but lacks any functional groups or rings, its property value is likely to be less negative (or more positive) than `-193.58006846` but more negative than some of the very small or highly substituted molecules. 

Looking at the trend, linear alkanes seem to have moderately negative values, and octane is larger than cyclohexane derivatives but simpler than alcohols or halogenated compounds. A reasonable estimate would be slightly more negative than `C/C1CCCCC1\C` but not as extreme as some of the smaller or more polar molecules.

**Predicted property value for `CCCCCCCC`: `-250.0`** (This is an educated guess based on the trend; the actual value could vary depending on the specific property being measured.) 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., energy, solubility, etc.—this is a rough interpolation based on the given examples.)

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 1994.9330196741305
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correspond to molecular descriptors or calculated properties (e.g., molecular weight, polarizability, or a quantum-chemical property like heat of formation or dipole moment). However, the exact nature of the property isn't explicitly stated, so I'll infer it based on the trends in the data.

The molecule in question is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, hydroxyl groups, a ketone, and an alkyne functionality. Comparing it to similar structures in the examples:

1. **Steroid-like molecules with ketones and hydroxyl groups** (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O`) have high positive values (e.g., 1938.39518212).
2. The presence of additional polar groups (e.g., `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCCCC1)C(=O)N2`) increases the value (444.09154352).
3. The alkyne (`C#C`) is present in fewer examples, but it likely contributes to the property value similarly to other unsaturated groups.

Given the structural similarity to `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` (value = 1938.39518212), but with an additional hydroxyl group and an alkyne, I would expect the property value to be higher. 

### Predicted property value:  
**Approximately 2100–2200**. 

A more precise estimate based on the examples would be:  
**2150.0** (interpolating between similar structures). 

However, looking at the closest example:  
`CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` (value = 2286.14295993), which has two ketones and one hydroxyl, our molecule has one ketone, two hydroxyls, and an alkyne. The alkyne might not contribute as much as a ketone, so the value could be slightly lower. 

### Final prediction:  
**2100.0** (rounded to a reasonable estimate based on the trends). 

---
**Note**: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on the given data. If the property is something like molecular polarizability or a quantum-chemical energy term, the value would depend heavily on the method used to compute it. The examples suggest a strong dependence on ring systems and functional groups. 

For higher accuracy, the exact property being predicted would need to be clarified.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 4004.0884119254965
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the range of property values observed in the provided examples, I will attempt to predict the property value based on structural features and trends from the given data.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Large, complex, and polycyclic aromatic systems** tend to have high positive values (e.g., `1138.86371719` for `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45`).
2. **Smaller, halogenated (Cl, Br, F) or oxygenated (OH, OMe) aromatic systems** tend to have negative values (e.g., `-693.0544819` for `Oc1ccccc1Cl`).
3. **Highly functionalized aliphatic systems** (e.g., sugars, polyols) can have moderate to high positive values (e.g., `3626.85837331` for the steroid-like structure).
4. **Presence of multiple heteroatoms (O, N, S)** and **conjugated systems** can increase the property value.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is:
```
COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
```
Breaking it down:
1. **Aromatic portion**: Contains a substituted benzene ring (`COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)`), which is moderately functionalized with methoxy (`OMe`) and hydroxy (`OH`) groups. This alone might suggest a negative or small positive value.
2. **Polycyclic/aliphatic portion**: Contains a complex fused ring system with multiple oxygen functionalities (ethers, alcohols, a ketone `C=O`), and a dioxolane-like structure (`OCOc5cc67`). This is reminiscent of a sugar-like or glycoside-like structure, which in the examples tends to have high positive values (e.g., `3626.85837331` for the steroid-like molecule).
3. **Overall**: The molecule is highly oxygenated and has a mix of aromatic and aliphatic complexity. The presence of multiple ethers, alcohols, and a ketone suggests a high positive value, but not as extreme as the largest steroid example.

### Comparison to Closest Examples:
- The steroid-like molecule (`C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21`) has a value of `3626.85837331`. This is much larger and more aliphatic.
- The polycyclic aromatic systems (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45`) have values around `1138-1178`.
- The glycoside-like complexity here is intermediate, but the aromatic portion may temper the value.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural features, I predict a **high positive value**, but not as extreme as the steroid example. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **2000 to 3000**. 

For specificity, I will predict:  
**Property value = 2450.0**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples. For precise predictions, computational methods or a larger training set would be needed.)

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -693.054481899716
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can analyze the relationship between the molecular structures and their corresponding property values to predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl**.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1I**: -253.56199046  
     (Phenol with iodine substitution)
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: -686.39326281  
     (Phenol with nitro substitution)
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: -683.87487391  
     (Phenol with nitro substitution, similar to the above)
   - **Fc1ccccc1**: -911.19098179  
     (Phenol with fluorine substitution)

2. **Chlorinated Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I**: -253.56199046  
     (Chlorobenzene with iodine substitution)
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl**: 325.8614354  
     (Dichlorobiphenyl)
   - **Clc1cccc2ccccc12**: -158.31396806  
     (Chloronaphthalene)

3. **Phenol with Chlorine Substitution**:
   - The molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is phenol with a chlorine substitution at the para position (assuming the structure is para-chlorophenol, as no position is specified). 

### Trend Analysis:
- Phenol derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -NO₂, -I, -F) tend to have negative property values, with fluorine being the most negative (-911.19).
- Chlorine is less electron-withdrawing than fluorine or nitro groups but more than iodine. The property value for **Clc1ccccc1I** is -253.56, and **Oc1ccccc1I** is -253.56, suggesting that the phenol group and iodine substitution have a similar effect in this context.
- The property value for **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is -683.87, which is much more negative than the iodine-substituted phenol, indicating that nitro groups have a stronger effect.

### Prediction for **Oc1ccccc1Cl**:
- Chlorine is less electron-withdrawing than nitro or fluorine but more than iodine. 
- The property value for **Oc1ccccc1I** is -253.56, and chlorine is somewhat similar in electronegativity to iodine but slightly more withdrawing. 
- Thus, the property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** should be slightly more negative than -253.56 but less negative than -683.87 (nitro) or -911.19 (fluoro).

### Estimated Value:
A reasonable prediction for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is **-300 ± 50**, based on interpolation from the examples. 

Looking at similar molecules:
- **Oc1ccccc1I**: -253.56  
- **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: -683.87  
- **Fc1ccccc1**: -911.19  

Since chlorine is between iodine and nitro/fluoro in electronegativity, a value around **-400** seems plausible, but the examples suggest a less extreme effect. 

Given that **Clc1ccccc1I** is -253.56 and **Oc1ccccc1I** is -253.56, and chlorine is slightly more withdrawing than iodine, the value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** might be slightly more negative than -253.56. 

### Final Prediction:
**-350.0** (This is an approximate interpolation based on the given data.) 

However, looking more carefully, the phenol group seems to dominate, and the chlorine substitution doesn't drastically change the value compared to iodine. Thus, a value close to **-253.56** (like **-260 to -300**) might be more accurate. 

Given the lack of exact matches, I'll predict:  
**-280.0** (a compromise between the iodine-substituted phenol and the more negative nitro/fluoro examples). 

But reviewing again, the phenol + chlorine combination might be closer to the iodine case, so **-253.56** is also plausible. 

Given the uncertainty, I'll round to:  
**-270.0** as a balanced estimate. 

### Exact Prediction:
After reconsidering the examples, the closest analog is **Oc1ccccc1I** (-253.56), and chlorine is slightly more electronegative than iodine, so the value should be slightly more negative. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is:  
**-270.0** (approximate). 

However, if we assume the property is additive or follows a linear trend, the difference between iodine and chlorine substitution might not be large, so **-253.56** (same as iodine) is also possible. 

Given the ambiguity, I'll stick with:  
**-270.0** as the final predicted value. 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property (e.g., energy, dipole moment, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. The true value could vary depending on the specific property being measured. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is **-270.0**.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **ClCC#CC**: A chloroalkyne fragment (chlorine attached to an alkyne).
   - **OC(=O)N**: A carbamate group (ester-linked amide).
   - **c1cccc(Cl)c1**: A chlorinated benzene ring (mono-substituted with chlorine).

2. **Similar Molecules in the Dataset**:
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)...**: Molecules with multiple chlorines on aromatic rings tend to have high positive values (e.g., 1137.59, 1343.67).
   - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC**: A diester with aromatic ring has a negative value (-127.99).
   - **CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1**: An aromatic ether with an amide has a slightly negative value (-16.43).
   - **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**: A complex halogenated molecule with amide and ketone has a high positive value (941.34).

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of **two chlorine atoms** (one aliphatic, one aromatic) suggests a moderate contribution to the property value.
   - The **carbamate group (OC(=O)N)** is polar and may reduce the value compared to purely halogenated molecules.
   - The **alkyne (C#C)** is relatively nonpolar but may slightly increase the value due to its unsaturation.

### Estimation:
- The molecule is less halogenated than highly chlorinated examples (e.g., 1137.59, 1343.67) but more complex than simple esters/amides (e.g., -127.99, -16.43).
- The carbamate group and alkyne balance the chlorines, leading to a value in the **low to mid positive range**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Based on the structural similarity to moderately polar/halogenated molecules in the dataset, the predicted property value for **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1** is:

**~450.0** (estimated range: 400–500). 

This accounts for the competing effects of the chlorines (increasing the value) and the polar carbamate/alkyne (moderating the increase).

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 1305.6652438210883
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** by analyzing structural features and trends in the data. Here's my reasoning:

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a central carbon (from the **OC(...)** group) bonded to:
   - A hydroxyl group (**O**).
   - A chlorinated phenyl ring (**c1ccc(Cl)cc1**).
   - A pyrimidine-like ring (**c2cncnc2**, which is a pyrimidine or similar heterocycle).
   - Another chlorinated phenyl ring (**c3ccccc3Cl**).

2. **Key Features**:
   - Two aromatic rings (one with a Cl substituent, another with a Cl substituent).
   - A heterocyclic ring (pyrimidine-like, which is polar and can participate in conjugation).
   - A hydroxyl group (polar, can form hydrogen bonds).
   - Multiple Cl substituents (electronegative, increase molecular weight and polarizability).

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with **multiple aromatic rings and Cl substituents** tend to have higher property values (e.g., **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has a value of 1296.03874641).
- Heterocycles like pyrimidine (e.g., **Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2** has a value of -537.17021732, but this is a smaller, less substituted system).
- The hydroxyl group may lower the value slightly compared to purely halogenated systems, but the presence of two Cl atoms and a heterocycle likely offsets this.

### Estimating the Value:
Given the complexity (two Cl atoms, two aromatic rings, a heterocycle, and a hydroxyl group), the value should be in the **higher range** but not as extreme as the largest values in the dataset (which exceed 2000). 

Looking at similar examples:
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (1296.03874641): Similar Cl and aromatic content, but more Cl atoms.
- **ClC(Cl)=C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** (1008.56240483): Multiple Cl and aromatic rings.
- **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O** (919.30505585): Heterocycle + Cl + aromatic.

The target molecule has fewer Cl atoms than the first two but more complexity than the third. A reasonable estimate would be between **900 and 1200**.

### Final Prediction:
Considering all factors, I predict the property value for **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl** to be approximately:  
**1050.0** (rounded to one decimal place).  

This is based on interpolation from the examples and the structural features contributing to the property.

Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -756.4943627345757
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with the molecular structure, including factors such as the presence of functional groups, molecular size, and substitution patterns. 

The molecule in question is **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate). Let's analyze its structure and compare it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. **Functional groups**: It contains an ester group (**-OC=O**), which is polar and can influence the property value. 
   - Similar molecules with ester groups in the dataset:
     - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate): -547.08520792
     - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C...** (a more complex ester): 3083.32137081
   - The simpler ester (**CCCC(=O)OCC**) has a negative value, while the more complex one has a large positive value. This suggests that simpler esters tend to have negative values, while larger/more complex esters have positive values.

2. **Chain length**: The molecule has a butyl chain (**CCCC**) attached to the ester. 
   - Compare to **CCCC(=O)OCC**, which has a butyl chain and a shorter ethoxy group, with a value of -547.08520792.
   - The molecule **CCCCOC=O** has a butyl chain and a formyloxy group (**OC=O**), which is slightly smaller than the ethoxy group in **CCCC(=O)OCC**.

3. **Trends**:
   - Smaller/aliphatic molecules with polar groups (e.g., **CCCCBr**: -491.88305474, **CCCC=O**: -594.91558299) tend to have negative values.
   - Esters like **CCCC(=O)OCC** also have negative values (-547.08520792).
   - The formate ester (**CCCCOC=O**) is even simpler than ethyl butyrate, so its value might be slightly more negative.

### Prediction:
Given that **CCCC(=O)OCC** has a value of -547.08520792 and **CCCCOC=O** is a simpler ester with a formyl group instead of an acetyl group, we can estimate that its value is slightly more negative. 

A reasonable prediction for **CCCCOC=O** is:  
**-600.0** (rounded to one decimal place based on the trend). 

However, looking more closely at the examples:
- **CCCC=O** (butyraldehyde) has a value of -594.91558299.
- **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate) has a value of -547.08520792.
- The formate ester (**CCCCOC=O**) is intermediate in complexity between these two. 

Thus, a more precise estimate would be between -550 and -600. Splitting the difference, we might predict:  
**-575.0**.

But to match the precision of the given examples, we'll provide a more specific value:  
**-570.0**.

### Final predicted property value for CCCCOC=O:  
**-570.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -1120.0085114355047
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values for molecules with chlorine (Cl) atoms tend to be negative when the molecule is small and simple. For instance:

- ClCCCl has a property value of -909.54871668
- Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of -668.18433317
- Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 62.15104417 (this is a larger, more complex molecule with multiple Cl atoms)
- CCBr has a property value of -912.80264425 (similar small molecule with Br instead of Cl)

The molecule in question, ClCCl (dichloromethane analog, but formally a 1,1-dichloroethane fragment), is a very small and simple molecule with two chlorine atoms. Based on the trend, small molecules with halogens (especially Cl) tend to have negative property values, and the magnitude is often large (e.g., around -900 to -1000 for very small molecules).

Comparing to ClCCCl (-909.54871668), which has one more carbon than ClCCl, we might expect ClCCl to have a slightly less negative value (since ClCCCl is larger and more polarizable, but this is speculative). However, CCBr (-912.80264425) is also very similar in size and has a very negative value.

Given these observations, a reasonable prediction for ClCCl would be in the range of -900 to -950. A plausible estimate could be:

**Predicted property value for ClCCl: -910.0**  

(This is an approximate interpolation based on the given examples.)
==================================================
Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -545.8505010912911
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, I will analyze the given examples and identify structural features that correlate with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol) has a value of **-840.09136553**.
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol) has a value of **-686.39326281**.
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (dimethylphenol) has a value of **-151.28358897**.

2. **Methyl Substitution**: 
   - Adding methyl groups tends to increase the property value (make it less negative or more positive). For example:
     - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (-840.09) vs. **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (-151.28) shows that methyl substitution raises the value significantly.

3. **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** (methyl-substituted phenol):
   - This is a **3-methylphenol** (meta-cresol) with an additional methyl group at the meta position. 
   - Compared to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (which has two methyl groups and a value of -151.28), this molecule has one fewer methyl group, so the value should be lower (more negative) but still higher than simple phenol derivatives like **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (-840.09).

4. **Aromatic Systems with Oxygen**:
   - **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenyl ether) has a value of **-14.65344671**.
   - **C1OC1c2ccccc2** (an aromatic ring with an epoxy) has a value of **-476.66786736**.
   - Phenol-like structures with fewer substitutions tend to have more negative values.

### Prediction for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**:
- This is a **methyl-substituted phenol** with one methyl group at the meta position. 
- It is structurally similar to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (value: -151.28) but with one fewer methyl group, so the value should be slightly more negative.
- It is also similar to **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (value: -840.09) but with a methyl group, which significantly increases the value.

Given these comparisons, a reasonable estimate for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** would be between **-200 and -400**. A precise interpolation suggests a value around **-300**.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**-287.45** (estimated based on structural trends in the examples). 

This is a rough but reasonable prediction given the data. For higher accuracy, a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model or additional examples would be needed.
==================================================
Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 727.9493451601973
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values tend to increase with the number of heavy atoms (especially halogens like Cl or Br) and aromatic rings, while smaller or less substituted molecules often have negative values. The molecule in question is:

**Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**

This is a biphenyl derivative with multiple chlorine substitutions. Breaking it down:
- It has two benzene rings (biphenyl core).
- It has **5 chlorine atoms**, which are heavy and contribute significantly to the property value based on the examples (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl has 7 Cl and a value of 1137.59242163).
- The structure is similar to the third example in the list (Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl), which has 5 Cl and a value of 939.06685565.

Comparing this to the given molecule:
- The given molecule has 5 Cl (same as the third example) but a slightly less substituted biphenyl core (no extra fused rings or additional heavy atoms).
- The third example has a slightly more complex structure (one ring is naphthalene-like), so the given molecule might have a slightly lower value.

However, another similar example is:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (7 Cl) with value 1137.59242163.
- Scaling down for 5 Cl, the value would be roughly (5/7)*1137.59 ≈ 812.56, but this seems too low compared to the third example (939.06685565 for 5 Cl).

Given the biphenyl core and 5 Cl substitutions, the value is likely close to the third example but slightly lower due to less crowding. A reasonable estimate would be slightly below 939.06685565, say **~900-920**.

Looking for a more precise pattern:
- The third example (5 Cl, more crowded) is 939.06685565.
- The given molecule (5 Cl, less crowded) should be slightly less, perhaps **~920**.

However, another approach is to note that adding Cl atoms seems to add ~200-300 per Cl (e.g., compare simpler Cl-substituted examples). The given molecule is very similar to the third example but with a simpler core, so I'll predict a value slightly lower than 939.06685565, say **925.0**.

**Final predicted property value: 925.0** (approximate, based on trend).
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -1009.5348178854373
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (2-methyl-2-butene) by comparing its structure and features to the molecules in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Dataset:
1. **Hydrocarbon Trends**:
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene) has a property value of **109.09180543**.
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane) has a property value of **-147.41229893**.
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane) has a property value of **-146.44895834**.
   - **CC(=O)C** (acetone) is not directly comparable, but carbonyls seem to increase the property value significantly when combined with larger structures.

2. **Alkenes vs. Alkanes**:
   - The presence of a double bond (C=C) tends to increase the property value compared to saturated analogs (e.g., nonene vs. octane).
   - Branched alkenes may have slightly different values depending on the substitution pattern.

3. **Small Alkenes**:
   - **CC=C(C)C** is a small branched alkene (5 carbons, one double bond). 
   - It is structurally simpler than nonene but has branching similar to **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**.

### Prediction:
- The property value for **CC=C(C)C** should be between the value for **CCCCCCCC** (octane, -147.41) and **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene, 109.09), but closer to the lower end because it is a smaller molecule.
- Branching may slightly reduce the property value compared to linear alkenes, but the double bond still increases it relative to alkanes.
- A reasonable estimate would be slightly negative or near zero.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the trends, I predict the property value for **CC=C(C)C** to be approximately:  
**-50.0** (with uncertainty due to limited comparable examples). 

However, looking more closely at the examples:
- **CCCCCCCC** (octane): -147.41  
- **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): -146.45  
- **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): +109.09  

For **CC=C(C)C**, which is smaller than nonene but has a double bond and branching, a plausible value might be around **-100 to 0**. A more precise guess based on interpolation is **-75.0**.

But since the dataset shows that even small changes can lead to significant differences, and no exact analog is present, this is an approximate prediction. 

### Final Prediction:
**-75.0** (This is an educated guess based on the limited examples.) 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted or more similar examples, this is speculative. The true value could differ.)
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -1120.0085114355047
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe that the property values vary widely based on the molecular structure, including factors such as the presence of halogens (Cl, F), aromatic rings, functional groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -CO), and molecular size/complexity. 

For the molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane, though the SMILES notation `ClCCl` is technically dichloromethane's simplified representation), we can make an educated prediction based on the following trends:
1. **Chlorine-containing molecules**: Many of the provided examples with multiple chlorine atoms have negative property values (e.g., `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` has -735.19566251, `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` has -492.01052702). However, some highly chlorinated aromatic systems (e.g., `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) have large positive values (1547.2354981), suggesting that chlorine's contribution depends heavily on context.
2. **Small, simple chlorinated alkanes**: The example `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) has a value of -735.19566251, which is highly negative. `ClCCl` is even simpler (fewer chlorines), so we might expect a less extreme but still negative value.
3. **Lack of aromaticity/functional groups**: The absence of aromatic rings or polar functional groups (like -OH, -NO2) tends to correlate with more negative values in the given dataset.

Given these observations, a reasonable prediction for `ClCCl` would be a negative property value, but less extreme than `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (-735.19566251) due to having fewer chlorines. 

**Predicted property value for ClCCl: ~ -400 to -500**  
A specific estimate could be **-450.0**, interpolating between the trends for small chlorinated molecules in the dataset. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., energy, polarizability, etc.—this is an empirical guess based on the given examples.)

Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -285.9297943322667
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The molecule in question is **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, which is a chlorinated phenol derivative (2,4,6-trichlorophenol). 

### Observations from the dataset:
1. **Chlorinated aromatic compounds** tend to have property values in the **negative to moderately positive range**, depending on substitution patterns.
   - Example: **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (2,4,6-trichlorophenol-like) has a value of **-288.44818324**.
   - Another example: **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** (hexabromobenzene) has a value of **174.07714463**.
   - **ClCC** (chloroethane) has a very negative value (**-1159.85989207**), but this is aliphatic.

2. **Phenol derivatives** with multiple chlorines tend to have **moderately negative values** unless other functional groups significantly alter the property.

3. The given molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is structurally similar to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (from the examples), but with a slightly different substitution pattern (2,4,6-trichlorophenol vs. 2,4,5-trichlorophenol). 

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (-288.44818324) and accounting for the slightly different chlorine arrangement (which may not drastically change the property), the predicted value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** should be **close to -288.45**, possibly slightly more negative due to the symmetry of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

### Final predicted value:
**-300.0** (rounded estimate based on the trend). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an interpolation based on the given data. If the property is something like "electronic energy" or "heat of formation," the value would follow the observed trend.)

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 4004.0884119254965
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the examples provided, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple functional groups:
1. **Aromatic rings with methoxy (-OCH₃) and hydroxyl (-OH) substituents**: Similar to examples like `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (-686.39) and `Cc1cc(C)c(O)c(C)c1` (-372.99), which have negative property values due to polar substituents.
2. **Sugar-like moieties (tetrahydrofuran and pyran rings with multiple -OH groups)**: Seen in `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (1184.72), which has a high positive value due to the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic ethers.
3. **Lactone (cyclic ester) group**: Present in `C6C2C(COC2=O)`, similar to cyclic carbonyls in other examples, contributing to higher values.
4. **Fused polycyclic system**: The molecule has a fused ring system similar to some of the larger polycyclic examples (e.g., `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5cccc6c(c1)c2c3c4c56` with 1454.55), which tend to have high positive values due to extended conjugation and rigidity.

### Comparison with Examples:
- The presence of multiple polar groups (OH, OCH₃) and cyclic ethers suggests contributions similar to `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (1184.72).
- The fused ring system and lactone group add to the value, similar to polycyclic examples like `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO` (2319.07), though the target molecule is less saturated.
- The aromatic rings with electron-donating groups (OCH₃, OH) may slightly reduce the value compared to purely hydrocarbon polycyclics.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the combination of:
1. High contributions from sugar-like moieties (~1000-1200),
2. Additional contributions from the fused ring system and lactone (~500-800),
3. Offsetting effects from polar substituents (~-200 to -400),

The predicted property value is likely in the range of **1800-2200**. 

A reasonable estimate is **~2000**, considering the balance of these features. For specificity, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 2015.25**

Iteration: 97
SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 475.4030430300521
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a 5-membered heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and sulfur atoms (`S` and `NN`), similar to some of the given examples (e.g., `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` with a property value of **808.40217094**).
2. **Substituents**:
   - A thiomethyl group (`CS-`), which is moderately polar.
   - A carbonyl group (`C=O`) in the ring, contributing to polarity.
   - A tertiary butyl group (`C(C)(C)C`), which is bulky and hydrophobic.
   - An amino group (`NH`) attached to the ring, adding polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The molecule `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (property = **808.40217094**) has a somewhat similar structure with a heterocyclic ring, carbonyl, and a bulky `C(C)(C)C` group. However, it also has additional complexity (e.g., an oxazolidinone ring and a thioamide group).
- The molecule `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1` (property = **-735.37400342**) is simpler but shares some features (e.g., a 5-membered ring with `NH` and `C=O`). Its value is much lower, likely due to the lack of bulky substituents and sulfur.

### Estimation:
Given the presence of the bulky `C(C)(C)C` group and the polar `C=O` and `NH` groups, the property value should be moderately high but not as high as **808.40217094** (due to the absence of the oxazolidinone ring). The sulfur atom (`S`) may also contribute to a higher value compared to purely hydrocarbon or oxygen/nitrogen systems.

A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **500–700**. Considering the balance between the polar groups and the bulky substituents, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 650.0**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the given data. For precise calculations, computational methods like DFT would be required.)

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values.

### Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Complexity**:
   - Molecules with simple aliphatic chains (e.g., **CC**, **CCBr**) tend to have negative property values (e.g., -1374.06, -912.80).
   - Aromatic rings (e.g., **c1ccccc1**) alone or with simple substituents (e.g., **Nc1ccccc1**) also have negative values (e.g., -869.23).
   - Introducing polar or complex functional groups (e.g., esters, amides, halogens, multiple rings) tends to increase the property value, sometimes significantly (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C** has +148.16, **ClC1(C(=O)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C14Cl)C5(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C45Cl** has +2150.55).

2. **Specific Examples**:
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2** has a very high value (+2118.87), likely due to the sulfonamide, aldehyde, and additional aromatic/heterocyclic complexity.
   - **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenyl ether) has a small negative value (-14.65), suggesting that aromaticity alone doesn't necessarily lead to high positive values unless combined with other features.
   - **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (a benzofuranone derivative) has a modest negative value (-84.81), indicating that even with carbonyl groups, the property can remain negative if the molecule isn't highly functionalized.

3. **Target Molecule: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**:
   - This is ethyl benzoate, consisting of an ester (**COC=O**) attached to a benzene ring.
   - Compared to **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (-14.65), the ester group is more polar but less complex than the sulfonamide in the high-value example.
   - Compared to **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (-84.81), it lacks the additional carbonyl and fused ring system, so it might be slightly less negative.
   - Compared to **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate, -336.63), the aromatic ring might increase the value somewhat.

### Prediction:
Given the above, **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is likely to have a property value in the small-to-moderate negative range, similar to or slightly higher than **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (-14.65) but less than **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (-84.81). 

A reasonable estimate would be around **-50 to -100**. Looking at the examples, a plausible value is **-75.0**.

### Final Answer:
**-75.0** (estimated property value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**). 

*Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples provided. For precise predictions, computational methods or a larger training dataset would be needed.*
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 139.49632952630054
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkyl Halides (e.g., CI, Br-substituted):**
   - **CI (iodomethane):** Property value = -727.75551894  
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (bromonaphthalene):** Property value = 13.86349831  
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl (hexachlorobiphenyl):** Property value = 524.38700138  
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O (complex chloro-thio compound):** Property value = 1414.29589903  

   Halogenated compounds (Cl, Br, I) tend to have property values that vary widely, but simpler alkyl halides (like CI) have negative values, while larger/aromatic halogenated compounds have positive values.

2. **Alkyl Chains (no halogens):**
   - **CCCC (=O)CCC (2-heptanone):** Property value = -395.2367357  
   - **CCCCC (=O)CCCC (2-nonanone):** Property value = 25.68285381  
   - **CCCCCCCO (1-octanol):** Property value = -311.94093355  
   - **CCCCCCC=C (1-octene):** Property value = -311.82778408  

   Longer alkyl chains with simple functional groups (e.g., alcohols, ketones, alkenes) tend to have negative property values, but the magnitude decreases as the chain lengthens or if the functional group is less polar (e.g., ketones vs. alcohols).

3. **Bromine-Specific Trends:**
   - The only other Br-containing example is **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (bromonaphthalene)**, which has a small positive value (13.86349831). However, this is an aromatic compound, so it may not directly compare to **CCCCCCCBr** (aliphatic bromoalkane).  
   - **CI (iodomethane)** is a simpler alkyl halide with a large negative value (-727.75551894). Bromine is less electronegative than iodine, so we might expect a less negative value for **CCCCCCCBr**.

4. **Chain Length Effect:**
   - For **CCCCCCCO (1-octanol, 8 carbons):** Property value = -311.94093355  
   - For **CCCCCCC=C (1-octene, 8 carbons):** Property value = -311.82778408  
   - For **CCCC (=O)CCC (2-heptanone, 7 carbons):** Property value = -395.2367357  

   Longer chains seem to reduce the magnitude of negative property values. **CCCCCCCBr** has 7 carbons, so we might expect a value slightly less negative than **CCCC (=O)CCC** (-395.2367357) but more negative than **CCCCCCCO** (-311.94093355).

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCBr**:
- It is a 7-carbon alkyl bromide (bromoheptane), analogous to 2-heptanone (**CCCC (=O)CCC**) but with Br instead of =O.  
- Br is less polar than =O but more polar than a simple alkyl chain, so the property value should be between **CCCC (=O)CCC** (-395.2367357) and **CCCCCCCO** (-311.94093355).  
- Given that **CI** is -727.75551894 and **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is +13.86349831, a reasonable estimate for **CCCCCCCBr** would be slightly less negative than **CCCC (=O)CCC**, perhaps around **-350 to -300**.  

Looking at the closest analogies:
- **CCCC (=O)CCC (7 carbons):** -395.2367357  
- **CCCCCCCO (8 carbons):** -311.94093355  
- **CCCCCCC=C (8 carbons):** -311.82778408  

Interpolating for **CCCCCCCBr (7 carbons)**, a plausible value is **-350**. However, since Br is less polar than =O but more polar than -OH or -H, we might adjust slightly higher (less negative).  

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr: -320.0**  
*(This is an estimate based on the trends observed in the given data.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -1606.7405018213044
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and molecular weight. Simple molecules with fewer atoms and less complexity tend to have lower (often negative) property values, while more complex molecules with multiple functional groups (e.g., nitro groups, aromatic rings, carbonyls, etc.) tend to have higher positive values.

Let's analyze the molecule **CO (carbon monoxide)**:
1. It is a very small and simple molecule (just two atoms: C and O).
2. It lacks the complexity or functional groups seen in molecules with high positive property values (e.g., aromatic rings, nitro groups, multiple bonds, etc.).
3. Comparing to other small molecules in the examples:
   - **CCC (propane)**: -1199.71127271
   - **CC#C (propyne)**: -1463.01265095
   - **NC(=O)N (urea)**: -1466.04357513
   - **CCCCOC=O (butyl formate)**: -756.49436273
   - **CO is even simpler than these, with just one carbon and one oxygen.**

Given this trend, **CO** would likely have a strongly negative property value, similar to or even more negative than small molecules like **CCC** or **CC#C**. 

### Predicted property value for **CO**: ~ **-1500.0** (estimated based on the trend of simpler molecules having more negative values). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molecular polarizability, heat of formation, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)
