SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 657.5908591326393
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular size, functional groups, and structural complexity. For instance:

1. **Hydrocarbons (e.g., CC=C, CCCCCC)**: Smaller hydrocarbons have negative values (e.g., CC=C: -784.58), while larger ones (e.g., CCCCCC: 169.41) have positive values. The trend suggests that increasing chain length increases the property value.

2. **Functional groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -Br, -C=O, -O-)**: 
   - Halogens (Cl, Br) tend to increase the property value significantly (e.g., Clc1cccc(Br)c1: 522.39).
   - Carbonyl groups (C=O) and esters (e.g., CCOC(=O)CC: -943.86) often reduce the value, but their effect depends on context.
   - Ethers (e.g., COc1ccccc1Cl: 6.57) and alcohols (e.g., CCCC(C)O: -801.68) vary.

3. **Aromatic systems**: 
   - Simple aromatics (e.g., c1ccccc1C(O)C(O)c2ccccc2: 78.41) have moderate values.
   - Halogenated aromatics (e.g., Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2: 1141.26) have high positive values.

4. **Complexity**: 
   - Molecules with multiple rings or fused systems (e.g., C1Cc2c3c1cccc3cc4c2ccc5ccccc54: 1988.17) have very high values.
   - Esters with long chains (e.g., CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC: 1191.41) also have high values.

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**:
This is a **long-chain ester** (decanoyl methyl ester, C10 chain with -COOCH3). Comparing it to similar examples:
- **CCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (octanoyl methyl ester) has a value of **1191.41**.
- **CCCCCC(=O)OC** (hexanoyl methyl ester) is not in the examples, but shorter esters like CCOC(=O)CC (propyl acetate) have much lower values (-943.86).

The trend suggests that **adding two more carbons (C10 vs. C8) would increase the property value further**, but not linearly. Given the jump from C6 (not shown) to C8 (1191.41), the increase for C10 might be smaller. 

### Estimated value: **~1250 to 1300**.
A reasonable prediction is **~1260**, considering the trend but with diminishing returns for longer chains.

However, looking at the closest example (CCCCCCCC(=O)OC: 1191.41), adding two more carbons might increase the value by ~50-100, so:

### Final predicted value: **~1240**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data.)

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -386.2345645410203
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2** by identifying structural patterns and correlating them with the known property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is a chlorinated benzofuran derivative with a lactam-like structure (containing **oc(=O)[nH]**). Breaking it down:
- A **chlorinated benzene ring** (Clc2ccc...).
- Fused to a **five-membered ring** with an oxygen (o), a carbonyl (C=O), and an NH group ([nH]).

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatics**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (high value: 2482.44) and **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (2456.30) suggest that multiple chlorines on aromatic rings correlate with high positive values.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (246.31) shows fewer chlorines reduce the value but still keep it positive.

2. **Heterocyclic Lactam/Carbonyl Structures**:
   - **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (very low: -1508.47) and **O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1** (extremely low: -2727.66) suggest that cyclic structures with multiple carbonyls/NH groups strongly reduce the property value.
   - The target has **oc(=O)[nH]**, which is similar but less extreme than these examples.

3. **Fused Ring Systems**:
   - **Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32** (1342.70) and **Cc1cccc2c(C)cccc12** (764.70) show fused aromatics with moderate positive values, but the target has a heterocyclic fusion.

### Combining Observations:
- The **chlorine** on the aromatic ring would push the value toward the positive range.
- The **oc(=O)[nH]** group (lactam-like) would push it toward the negative range, but not as strongly as the extreme examples with multiple carbonyls/NH.
- The **fused ring** system (benzofuran-like) might add a small positive contribution.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the balance between the chlorine (+ effect) and the lactam-like group (- effect), and comparing to similar molecules:
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (246.31) is simpler but has more chlorines.
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)CC=C(C)C** (-675.93) is more complex but has stronger negative contributions.

The target molecule is intermediate in complexity, with one chlorine and one moderately negative functional group. A reasonable estimate would be slightly negative but not extreme.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-500.0** (approximate, based on structural analogies). 

This is a rough estimate, as the exact property being predicted isn't specified (e.g., dipole moment, energy, etc.), but it aligns with the trend of chlorines increasing the value and lactam-like groups decreasing it. For a more precise prediction, statistical modeling or quantum calculations would be needed.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -1140.9143248399482
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and electronegativity. The molecule in question, **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), contains a nitro group (**N(=O)=O**), which is highly polar and electronegative. 

Looking at similar molecules in the examples:
- **Nc1nccs1** (with N and S heteroatoms) has a value of **-1104.10401559**.
- **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (with N, O, and F) has **-1948.48324694**.
- **Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO** (with a nitro group) has **-1537.39830263**.

The nitro group tends to contribute significantly to negative property values due to its strong electron-withdrawing nature. The molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is simpler than some of the above examples but still has a nitro group attached to a small alkyl chain (isopropyl). 

Given this, I estimate its property value to be in the range of **-500 to -1000**. A reasonable prediction would be:

**Predicted property value: -712.34567890**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the trend; the actual value would require computational or empirical validation.)

Iteration: 4
SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 224.21446731637334
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, it appears that the property in question correlates with molecular complexity, size, and the presence of specific functional groups (e.g., halogens, carbonyl groups, aromatic rings, etc.). The property values range from highly negative (e.g., -757.8 for small or less complex molecules) to highly positive (e.g., 3823.6 for large, halogen-rich, or polycyclic structures).

The molecule to predict is:
**CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**

### Analysis of the molecule:
1. **Size and complexity**: This is a large, polycyclic structure with multiple rings (steroid-like framework) and functional groups, suggesting a high property value.
2. **Functional groups**:
   - Two carbonyl groups (`C=O`, one in a ring and one as an aldehyde).
   - One hydroxyl group (`OH`).
   - Multiple aliphatic rings (steroid backbone), which contribute to complexity.
3. **Comparison to examples**:
   - Similar to `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` (property = 1631.49), which is also a steroid-like structure with carbonyl groups. The given molecule is slightly more complex due to the additional `C(=O)CO` substituent and an `OH` group.
   - The presence of polar groups (`OH`, `C=O`) and ring strain may further increase the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to the example with a value of 1631.49 and the additional complexity, the predicted property value for **CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO** is likely higher, in the range of **1700–1800**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: ~1750.0**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

Iteration: 5
SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 849.168676796918
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural components and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Breakdown:
1. **Aromatic rings**: 
   - Two benzene rings: one with two fluorine substituents (`Fc1cccc(F)c1`), and one with a chlorine substituent (`Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2`).
   - From the examples, aromatic rings with halogens contribute significantly to the property value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` = 447.74, `BrC(Br)(Br)Br` = 573.57, `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` = 250.69).

2. **Amide groups**: 
   - Two amide linkages (`C(=O)NC(=O)N`). 
   - From examples like `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` = -682.09 and `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` = -1476.86, amide/urea-like groups tend to reduce the property value.

3. **Halogen substituents**: 
   - Two fluorines and one chlorine. Halogens generally increase the property value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` = 447.74, `Fc1ccccc1` = 250.69).

4. **Overall size and complexity**: 
   - The molecule is larger than most examples, with multiple functional groups. Larger molecules (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` = 3906.13) have higher property values, but functional groups can modulate this.

### Estimation:
- The aromatic rings with halogens will contribute positively (e.g., ~250 for the fluorinated ring, ~450 for the chlorinated ring).
- The urea-like linkage (`C(=O)NC(=O)N`) will reduce the value significantly (e.g., by ~1000–1500 based on similar groups in the examples).
- The net effect is likely a moderate positive value, but the amide groups may pull it down.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the competing effects, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-200 to 200**.  

However, looking closely at similar molecules:
- `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` = 447.74 (two chlorines on benzene).
- `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` = -682.09 (amide + benzene).
- `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` = 250.69 (fluorinated benzene).

This molecule combines fluorinated benzene, chlorinated benzene, and a urea linkage. The urea linkage's negative contribution (~-682) may roughly cancel the positive contributions of the halogenated rings (~447 + 250 = 697), leading to a small net value.

### Final Prediction:
**~15.0** (close to zero due to balancing effects).  

For specificity, we'll predict:  
**15.0** (but with high uncertainty due to competing group contributions).  

However, observing that `CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(=O)C2` (a complex ketone) = 42.90, and this molecule is more polar/functionalized, a slightly negative value is plausible.  

Revised prediction:  
**-50.0** (accounting for the urea's stronger negative effect).  

But given the variability, a safer estimate is:  
**0.0 ± 50**.  

For a single-point answer:  
**-25.0**.  

(Note: Without a clear trend or model, this is an educated guess. The true value could vary widely.)  

### Exact Prediction:
After careful consideration, the predicted property value for **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2** is:  
**-75.0**.

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -354.1452800822533
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correspond to molecular weights or a related property (though not exactly matching standard molecular weights, they are likely derived or calculated values based on some weighted or adjusted formula). 

Let's analyze the given molecule: **CCCOC(C)C** (structure: propyl isopropyl ether).

### Step-by-step prediction:
1. **Pattern observation**: The property values in the examples are not standard molecular weights but are correlated with molecular size/complexity. For instance:
   - Simple molecules like `CCCCCC(O)CC` (heptan-2-ol) have a value of `-0.95788909`, while larger or more complex molecules have higher absolute values.
   - Ethers like `CCOC(=O)CC` (ethyl propanoate) have a value of `-943.86285524`, while `CCCOC(C)C` is a simpler ether.

2. **Comparison with similar molecules**:
   - `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (2-methylhexan-2-ol) has a value of `-267.86684148`.
   - `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (2,3-dimethylbutan-2-ol) has a value of `-366.46099693`.
   - `CCCCCO` (pentan-1-ol) has a value of `-800.59001589`.

   The molecule `CCCOC(C)C` is an ether with 6 carbons, similar in size to some of these alcohols but less polar (no OH group). Ethers in the examples (e.g., `CCOC(=O)CC`) have negative values, and simpler ethers tend to be less negative than alcohols.

3. **Estimate**:
   - Given that `CCCCCO` (pentan-1-ol) is `-800.59` and `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (6-carbon alcohol) is `-366.46`, the ether `CCCOC(C)C` (6-carbon ether) would likely be less negative than the alcohol but more negative than very small molecules.
   - A reasonable guess would be between `-200` and `-400`.

4. **Final prediction**:
   - A plausible value for `CCCOC(C)C` is **`-300.0`** (rounded for simplicity, as the exact calculation method isn't specified).

### Predicted property value:
**-300.0** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property or calculation method, this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: -520.3253527761822
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **dihydropyrimidine-2,4-dione (uracil-like) core** with substitutions:
   - A **bromine (Br)** at one position.
   - A **methyl (C)** and **ethyl (CCC)** group attached to the nitrogen.
   - Two **carbonyl (C=O)** groups, one of which is an **amide (NH)**.

2. **Key Observations from Examples**:
   - **Halogenated aromatics (e.g., Cl-substituted benzene rings)** tend to have high positive values (e.g., 447.74, 894.81, 2035.38).
   - **Bromine substitutions** (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1`) have moderate positive values (46.87).
   - **Amides/carbonyls** can contribute negatively (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` has -1491.71).
   - **Heterocycles with N and O** (e.g., `Nc1nccs1`) tend to have negative values (-1104.10).

3. **This Molecule**:
   - Combines a **bromine (positive contribution)** with a **heterocyclic amide/carbonyl core (negative contribution)**.
   - The **ethyl group (CCC)** and **methyl (C)** are neutral/slightly negative (similar to aliphatic chains in examples like `CC(C)CCO` with -899.18).

### Prediction:
Given the competing effects:
- The **bromine** might contribute ~+50 to +100 (based on `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` = 46.87).
- The **heterocyclic core with two carbonyls/NH** might contribute ~-1000 to -500 (similar to other amides/heterocycles).
- The **aliphatic groups (CCC, C)** might slightly offset the negativity.

A reasonable estimate is **between -300 and -600**. Looking at similar molecules:
- `CCCCc1c(C)nc(nc1O)N(C)C` (with Br replaced by O/N) = -300.90.
- `Nc1nccs1` (simpler heterocycle) = -1104.10.

Given the **bromine's moderating effect**, the value is likely **less negative than -1104.10** but more negative than -300.90. A plausible prediction is:

**Predicted Property Value: -450.0**  
*(This is an educated guess based on balancing the contributions of the functional groups.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 694.1959064363496
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, aromaticity, and the presence of certain functional groups or substituents. The molecule in question is **biphenyl** (`c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`), which consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond.

From the examples:
- Simple aromatic systems like `c1ccccc1` (benzene) are not explicitly listed, but similar structures with substitutions or additional rings have higher values.
- `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` (coronene, a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a very high value (3133.80), indicating that larger conjugated systems increase the property value.
- `Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34` (a polycyclic aromatic with nitrogen) has a value of 1634.84, suggesting that fused aromatic rings contribute significantly.
- `Cc1cc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1` (a naphthalene derivative) has a value of 1342.70, which is higher than biphenyl would likely be due to the fused ring system.

Biphenyl is less conjugated and less complex than fused polycyclic aromatics like naphthalene or coronene, so its value should be lower than those. However, it is more complex than a single benzene ring. 

Looking at the examples, a reasonable estimate for biphenyl would be in the range of **700–900**. A plausible prediction is:

**Predicted property value for biphenyl (`c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`): 800.0**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. The actual value could vary slightly depending on the specific property being modeled.)
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -426.05538235552393
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to vary widely based on the molecular structure, including factors such as size, functional groups, aromaticity, halogens, and other substituents. 

For the molecule **CCCCS** (1-butanethiol), which is a simple aliphatic thiol with a linear chain of four carbons and a terminal sulfur (thiol group), we can make an educated prediction based on the following observations from the dataset:

1. **Small aliphatic molecules** (e.g., **CCCC(=C)C** with a value of 16.147, **CC(C)I** with -348.397) tend to have moderate absolute values, with positive or negative signs depending on substituents.
2. **Sulfur-containing molecules** in the dataset (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O** with -1017.620, **Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** with 2035.377) show a wide range, but simpler thiols or sulfides are not directly represented.
3. The presence of **sulfur (S)** in **CCCCS** suggests a possible positive contribution to the property value, as sulfur is polarizable and can influence electronic properties.

Given that **CCCCS** is a small, non-aromatic, non-halogenated molecule with a single sulfur, we might expect a moderate positive value, similar in magnitude to other small aliphatic compounds but slightly higher due to the sulfur. 

Comparing to **CCCC(=C)C** (16.147) and **CC(C)I** (-348.397), **CCCCS** is likely closer to the former but with a higher value due to sulfur. 

### Predicted property value for **CCCCS**: **~150.0** (estimated range: 100 to 200). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molecular polarizability, heat of formation, etc.—this is an approximate extrapolation from the given examples.)

Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -365.36626654544676
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Branching and Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with **longer alkyl chains** (e.g., `CCCC/C=C/C`) tend to have positive property values (e.g., 283.056).
   - **Hydroxyl groups (-OH)** often reduce the property value (e.g., `CCCC(C)(O)CC` has -267.867, `CC(C)CC(C)O` has -633.370).
   - **Branched alkanes** with no polar groups (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)C`) have positive values (e.g., 70.815 for `CCC(C)(C)C`, 772.948 for `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C`).

2. **Impact of Oxygen (Alcohol)**:
   - The presence of an **-OH group** significantly lowers the property value (e.g., `CCCC(C)(O)CC` is -267.867, `CC(C)CC(C)O` is -633.370).
   - The property reduction seems more pronounced when the -OH is on a more substituted carbon (secondary or tertiary).

3. **Specific Comparison**:
   - Compare `CCCC(C)(C)CO` (target) with `CCCC(C)(O)CC` (given example):
     - Both are branched alkanes with an -OH group.
     - `CCCC(C)(O)CC` has the -OH on a tertiary carbon and a value of **-267.867**.
     - `CCCC(C)(C)CO` has the -OH on a primary carbon (less steric hindrance), which might reduce the property less severely.
   - Compare with `CC(C)CC(C)O` (value: -633.370), where the -OH is on a secondary carbon.

### Prediction:
The target molecule `CCCC(C)(C)CO` is a branched alkane with a **primary -OH group**. Given that:
- Tertiary -OH (e.g., `CCCC(C)(O)CC`) gives -267.867.
- Secondary -OH (e.g., `CC(C)CC(C)O`) gives -633.370.
- Primary -OH is less destabilizing than tertiary/secondary, so the value should be **less negative** than -267.867 but still negative.

Given the examples, a reasonable estimate is between **-200 and -100**. A plausible prediction is:

**Predicted property value: -150.0**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For higher accuracy, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or more data would be needed.)

Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 553.6735771796003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Key Observations:
1. **Benzene Rings and Substitution**: 
   - The molecule **c1ccccc1** (benzene) has a property value of **-446.37631516**.
   - Adding a methyl group (**Cc1ccccc1**) changes the property to **-61.57858425** (not directly given, but **CCc1ccccc1** is **-61.57858425**, suggesting methyl substitution increases the value significantly).
   - The molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1C** (two methyl groups on benzene) has a value of **186.69258331**.

2. **Fused Rings**:
   - The molecule **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (a naphthalene with a methyl group) has a value of **1342.70050336**.
   - The molecule **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (a naphthalene with two methyl groups) has a value of **764.69654334**.

3. **Target Molecule**: 
   - **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is a naphthalene with one methyl group (similar to **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** but without the extra fused ring). 
   - The presence of a methyl group on a naphthalene core tends to give a high positive value (as seen in the examples).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Naphthalene with one methyl group (**Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1**) has a value of **1342.70050336**,
- The target molecule is a simpler naphthalene with one methyl group, the value should be somewhat lower but still in a similar range.

A reasonable estimate is **~1000**. 

However, looking at **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (two methyl groups on naphthalene) with a value of **764.69654334**, the single methyl group version should be higher. 

Given the examples, the predicted property for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is likely close to **1200**. 

But to be precise, since **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (more complex) is **1342.70050336**, the simpler **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** might be slightly lower, say **~1100**.

However, the closest analogous example is **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (764.69654334), but with one less methyl group, the value might be higher. 

Given the uncertainty, a conservative estimate is **~900-1200**. 

### Final Prediction:
**1000.0** (rounded to a reasonable value based on the trends). 

However, looking back, the naphthalene with one methyl group (**Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1**) is **1342.70050336**, and the target molecule is simpler, so perhaps **~1200**.

But to match the given examples more closely, the predicted value is:

**900.0** (as a middle-ground estimate). 

However, the most accurate guess based on the data is likely closer to **1000-1200**, so I'll predict:

**1100.0**. 

But to be precise, since **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** is **764.69654334** (two methyl groups), and **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** is **1342.70050336**, the single methyl naphthalene (**Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**) is probably in between, say **1000.0**.

### Final Answer:
**1000.0** (approximate based on trends). 

(Note: Without a clear mathematical model, this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: -675.927593109077
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correspond to **molecular polarizability** (in units of \(10^{-30} \, \text{cm}^3\) or atomic units), as they are large, span a wide range, and are sensitive to molecular size, conjugation, and electronegative substituents.

### Analysis of the target molecule:
The molecule is:  
**O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**  

This is a cyclic urea derivative with:
1. A conjugated carbonyl (C=O) and amide (N-C=O) system (increases polarizability).
2. A bulky alkyl substituent (C(C)CCC) and an alkenyl group (CC=C), which add to the polarizability but are less impactful than conjugated systems.
3. No strongly electronegative substituents (like Cl, F, or NO₂) that would drastically alter the value.

### Comparison with similar examples:
1. **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** has a value of **-1644.96924724**. This is a smaller analog (lacking the C(C)CCC group). The target molecule has an additional alkyl chain, which would increase polarizability but not dramatically (alkyl chains contribute modestly).
2. **c1ccccc1NC(=O)c2c(O)cccc2** (with aromatic rings and conjugation) has a value of **209.0250832**.
3. **CC1=CCC(CC1)C(C)=C** (pure hydrocarbon with an alkene) has a value of **663.61187626**.

### Prediction:
The target molecule has:
- A conjugated cyclic urea core (similar to the first example but with an extra alkyl chain).
- The alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) and CC=C substituents will increase polarizability compared to the first example, but not enough to reach positive values like the aromatic examples.  

Given the first example's value (-1644.96924724) and the added polarizability from the alkyl/alkene groups (~+500–800 based on other examples), the predicted value is likely in the range of **-1000 to -500**.  

A reasonable estimate:  
**Predicted property value: -1100.0**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property or scaling, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. The values may represent a computed or experimental polarizability-related metric.)

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 250.69325854354275
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including functional groups, aromaticity, halogens, and molecular size. 

For the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), we can analyze its features:
1. **Aromatic ring (benzene)**: Aromatic rings generally contribute positively to the property value (e.g., `c1ccccc1` in many examples increases the value).
2. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: Fluorine substituents, especially multiple fluorines, tend to increase the property value (e.g., `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` has a high positive value of 414.36, and other halogenated aromatics also show high values).
3. **No other functional groups**: The absence of polar or negatively contributing groups (like alcohols, esters, or amines) avoids reducing the property value.

Comparing to similar molecules:
- `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (414.36) has two halogens and is aromatic.
- `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` (2482.44) has multiple chlorines and aromatic rings.
- `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` has three fluorines and one aromatic ring, which is less bulky than heavily chlorinated examples but still strongly electron-withdrawing.

Given this, the trifluoromethyl group's strong electron-withdrawing nature and aromaticity suggest a **moderately high positive property value**. A reasonable estimate would be between **400 and 800**, leaning toward the lower end due to fewer halogens than the highly chlorinated examples.

**Predicted property value: 650.0** (approximate, based on trends in the data).

Iteration: 14
SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -3804.461776215921
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and polarity. The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar alcohol (likely **sorbitol** or a similar polyol). 

From the examples, highly oxygenated molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, property = **-4053.51293918**) have very negative property values, likely due to high polarity or solvation energy. The molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is structurally similar but has a cyclic structure with five hydroxyl groups, which would still confer high polarity but may slightly reduce the magnitude of the property compared to the linear analog.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trend, I predict the property for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** to be:  
**-3800.0** (approximate, likely in the range of -3500 to -4000 based on the examples).  

However, since the linear analog (**OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**) is **-4053.51293918**, and cyclization slightly reduces the number of free rotatable bonds (thus potentially less negative), a refined estimate would be closer to:  
**-3900.0**.  

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**-3924.71825000** (a reasoned interpolation).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the observed trend of highly oxygenated molecules having large negative values.)

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: -144.09388714320446
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values appear to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, halogens, and polar groups. The molecule in question is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural features:
1. **Multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)** – These are present in esters (CC(=O)OCC(=O)) and ketones (C=O in rings), which tend to increase the property value (e.g., compare CCCCC(=O)CCCC with 408.40).
2. **Steroid-like polycyclic structure** – The molecule has a fused 4-ring system (similar to steroids), which is highly complex and contributes significantly to the property value (e.g., see CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C with 1320.72).
3. **Hydroxyl groups (OH)** – These polar groups can influence the property, though their effect varies (e.g., OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO has a very negative value, but this is an extreme case due to many OH groups).
4. **Conjugated double bonds (C=CC=O)** – These can add to the complexity (e.g., compare with CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C).

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** has a value of **1711.27**, which is structurally very similar but lacks the additional C=O and OH groups in the query molecule.
- **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** has a value of **1320.72**, which is less complex than the query molecule.

### Adjustments for additional features:
1. The query molecule has **two extra C=O groups** (in the ester and the side chain), which should increase the value.
2. It also has **two OH groups**, which may slightly increase or decrease the value depending on their positioning (but in this case, they likely add to the complexity).

### Predicted value:
Given the similarity to **1711.27** but with additional functional groups, the property value should be **higher**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: ~1950.0**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the trend in the examples, where more complex and highly functionalized molecules have larger positive values. The exact value would require computational verification, but this is a plausible prediction given the data.)

Iteration: 16
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 1108.4829371353542
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, halogens, and polar groups. The molecule in question is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, an alcohol group, and a ketone, which suggests a relatively high property value due to its size and functionalization.

Breaking it down:
- The molecule has a tetracyclic core (steroid-like), which is large and contributes significantly to the property value.
- It includes an alcohol group (`O` attached to a ring) and a ketone (`C=O`), both of which are polar and likely increase the property value.
- Comparing to similar complex molecules in the examples (e.g., `OC(C1=CC2C5C(C1C2=C(c3ccccc3)c4ccccn4)C(=O)NC5=O)(c6ccccc6)c7ccccn7` with a value of 1334.47634133), this molecule is less aromatic but similarly large and functionalized.

From the examples:
- `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (a simpler steroid-like structure with two hydroxyl groups) has a value of 869.0790857.
- `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl` (a complex aromatic with polar groups and halogens) has a value of 1182.71934148.

Given the size and functional groups (alcohol and ketone) but lack of halogens or extensive aromaticity, the property value is likely in the range of **800–1200**. A reasonable estimate would be close to the steroid-like example (`869.0790857`), but slightly higher due to the additional ketone group.

**Predicted property value: ~950.0** (specific estimate: **948.37261582**). 

This is an educated guess based on the trend observed in the examples. For precise prediction, computational methods or a larger training set would be needed.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -537.6494611449667
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** by identifying patterns in the data. 

### Observations from the given data:
1. **Functional groups and their contributions**:
   - **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**: Often associated with negative property values (e.g., -509.186 for O=N(=O)c1ccccc1, -503.302 for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O).
   - **Amide groups (C(=O)N)**: Mixed contributions, but often negative or small positive values (e.g., -842.463 for O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2).
   - **Aromatic rings**: Can contribute positively or negatively depending on substituents.
   - **Acetyl group (CC(=O))**: Often associated with small positive or negative values (e.g., 141.494 for CCCCCCC(=O)C, -1211.867 for CC(C)OC=O).

2. **Combination of functional groups**:
   - The molecule has both an amide (CC(=O)N) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring. Similar structures like O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (-509.186) and COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (-503.302) suggest the nitro group alone gives ~ -500 to -510. Adding the amide group (which is electron-withdrawing and may further lower the property) could push the value more negative.

3. **Specific examples for comparison**:
   - O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2 has an amide and nitro group and gives -842.463.
   - COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a nitro group and gives -503.302.
   - Our molecule is simpler than the first example but has both amide and nitro, so the value is likely between these two.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is likely in the range of **-600 to -700**. A reasonable estimate based on the trends is:

**Predicted property value: -650.0**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples provided. For precise predictions, computational chemistry tools or more extensive training data would be needed.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 1298.0081353246587
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse set of molecules and their corresponding property values, it appears that the property in question is likely related to the **heat of formation (ΔHf)** or a similar thermodynamic property, as the values span a wide range and include both positive and negative numbers, which is typical for such properties.

To predict the property for the new molecule:  
**CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's break it down structurally and compare it to the provided examples:

### Key structural features of the new molecule:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)SC)**: This is a relatively complex and polar functional group. None of the provided examples contain phosphorus, but sulfur-containing groups (e.g., CSSC, thiophene derivatives) tend to have moderately negative or positive values (e.g., CSSC: -486.88).
2. **Chlorinated benzoxazole (n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12)**: This is a heterocyclic aromatic system with a chlorine substituent. Chlorinated aromatics in the examples (e.g., Clc1cccc2ccccc12: 789.71, Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1: 894.81) tend to have positive values, especially with multiple halogens.
3. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**: Ether/alcohol groups in the examples (e.g., CCO: -1334.41, CCCC(C)O: -801.68) tend to contribute negative values, but the effect may be offset by other groups.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- The molecule combines a phosphorothioate (likely negative contribution) with a chlorinated aromatic (positive contribution). 
- The closest analog might be **Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (789.71)** or **Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1 (894.81)**, but with additional complexity from the P(=S) and heterocycle.
- The presence of sulfur (e.g., CSSC: -486.88) and oxygen (e.g., CCO: -1334.41) suggests some negative contribution, but the aromatic system and chlorine likely dominate.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of a chlorinated aromatic (strong positive contribution) and polar/heteroatom-rich groups (moderate negative contribution), the net value is likely **positive but not extremely high**. 

A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **400 to 800**, similar to other chlorinated aromatics but adjusted for the additional complexity. 

**Predicted property value: ~650.0**  
*(This is an educated guess based on the examples; the actual value could vary depending on the specific property and computational method used.)*

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -899.1841713371275
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO** by comparing its structure and functional groups to the molecules in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Functional Groups and Structure**: The molecule **CC(C)(C)CO** is a tertiary alcohol (specifically, 2-methyl-2-propanol or tert-butanol) with a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a highly branched carbon (tertiary carbon). 

2. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol, a primary alcohol) has a property value of **-1166.09312373**.
   - **CCCC(C)O** (2-methyl-1-butanol, a primary alcohol) has a property value of **-267.86684148**.
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (a tertiary alcohol attached to an aromatic ring) has a property value of **331.85383258**.
   - **CCCCCC(C)O** (a secondary alcohol) has a property value of **265.95106331**.
   - **CCCCCCC(C)O** (a secondary alcohol) has a property value of **-0.95788909**.

3. **Trends**:
   - Primary alcohols (less branched) tend to have more negative values (e.g., -1166, -267).
   - Secondary and tertiary alcohols (more branched) tend to have less negative or positive values (e.g., 265, 331).
   - The tertiary alcohol **CC(C)(C)CO** is even more branched than the examples above, which suggests its property value might be less negative or positive compared to primary alcohols.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Given the trend, the value for **CC(C)(C)CO** should be less negative than **CC(C)CO** (-1166) but not as positive as some of the aromatic tertiary alcohols (e.g., 331). 
   - A reasonable estimate would be between **-200 and 100**.

   Looking at the closest analog (**CCCCCC(C)O** with value **265.95106331**), but accounting for the increased branching in **CC(C)(C)CO**, I predict a slightly lower value. 

   **Final Prediction**: **~150.0** (specific value: **150.12345678** as a placeholder, but this is speculative).

However, since the dataset shows that branching and alcohol type significantly affect the property, and without a clear mathematical model, this is an educated guess. The actual value could vary, but it should be in the positive range based on the trend.

**Predicted Property Value for CC(C)(C)CO**: **150.12345678** (example placeholder; exact value uncertain without a model). 

For a more precise prediction, a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model would be needed.

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -1842.431240737039
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values appear to correspond to **molecular polarizability** (often reported in units of a.u.³ or Å³), which is influenced by the size, conjugation, and electronegativity of the molecule. 

The molecule in question is **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12**, a purine-like structure with significant conjugation and multiple heteroatoms (N and O). Based on the trends observed in the examples:
- Highly conjugated systems (e.g., aromatic rings with heteroatoms) tend to have **negative polarizability values** when electronegative atoms (like O, N, halogens) dominate.
- Examples like `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` (-1948.48) and `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` (-2043.66) show very negative values for similar N/O-rich heterocycles.

**Prediction**:  
The molecule `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` is structurally similar to the above examples but with even more conjugation and N/O participation. Thus, its polarizability should be **strongly negative**, likely in the range of **-1500 to -2500**.  

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**-1800.0** (specific value interpolated from trends).  

*(Note: Without computational tools, this is an educated guess based on structural analogies. For precise values, DFT calculations would be required.)*

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -1211.8665380248972
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Esters and Ethers**:
   - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (a phosphate ester) has a value of **-92.37**.
   - **CCCOC(C)C** (an ether) has a value of **-354.15**.
   - Esters and ethers with small aliphatic chains tend to have moderately negative values.

2. **Carbonyl-Containing Compounds**:
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a steroid-like ketone) has a high positive value (**1711.27**), but this is likely due to its large, rigid structure.
   - **CCC(C)C(=O)C** (a ketone) has a value of **-490.92**, suggesting that simple ketones/aldehydes with small aliphatic groups have negative values.

3. **Methyl Acetate (CC(C)OC=O)**:
   - This is a simple ester with a methyl group and an acetyl group. Structurally, it is similar to **CCCOC(C)C** (ether, -354.15) but with a carbonyl (C=O) instead of an alkyl group.
   - The presence of the carbonyl (ester functionality) may slightly increase the property value compared to pure ethers, but it is still a small, flexible molecule.

4. **Comparison to Other Small Polar Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) has a value of **-1335.50**, but this is an alcohol, which is more polar and likely has stronger intermolecular interactions.
   - **ClCCCCl** (a dichlorinated alkane) has a value of **-331.77**, which is somewhat comparable to ethers/esters.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Small esters/ethers tend to have values in the range of **-100 to -400**.
- The presence of the ester group (C=O) in **CC(C)OC=O** would likely place it closer to the more negative end of this range (similar to **CCCOC(C)C** at **-354.15**), but not as extreme as alcohols.

Thus, a reasonable estimate for **CC(C)OC=O** is:  
**-300.0** (rounded to one decimal place for simplicity, given the variability in the examples).

### Refined Estimate:
Looking more closely:
- **CCCOC(C)C** (ether, -354.15) is structurally similar but lacks the carbonyl.
- **CCC(C)C(=O)C** (ketone, -490.92) is a ketone, not an ester.
- **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (phosphate ester, -92.37) is more complex.

Given that methyl acetate is a simple ester, its value is likely between **-250 and -350**. A good midpoint is:  
**-300.0**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is:  
**-300.0**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., heat of formation, polarizability, etc.—this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)

SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 678.4591571282119
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might help us estimate the property value.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings (e.g., benzene)**: 
   - Simple benzene derivatives (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl`) have negative values (e.g., -200.746). 
   - Substitution with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`) leads to more negative values (-710.617).
   - Substitution with electron-donating groups (e.g., `Cc1ccc(N)cc1`) also gives negative values (-521.215).

2. **Amide Groups (`-CONH-`)**:
   - Molecules with amide groups (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1`) tend to have positive values (46.868). 
   - More complex amides (e.g., `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1`) have highly negative values (-1342.276).

3. **Symmetry and Multiple Aromatic Rings**:
   - Molecules with multiple aromatic rings (e.g., `Cc1cccc2ccccc12`) have positive values (553.674).
   - Symmetric structures (e.g., `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`) have very high positive values (1788.926).

4. **Urea-like Structures (`-N-C(=O)-N-`)**:
   - The molecule `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` is a urea derivative with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. 
   - Similar urea-like structures (e.g., `NC(=S)N`) have highly negative values (-2155.456), but this is a thiourea, which may not be directly comparable.
   - The presence of two aromatic rings may offset some of the negativity.

### Prediction for `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2`:
- The molecule is symmetric with two phenyl groups attached to a urea core (`-N-C(=O)-N-`). 
- Urea derivatives tend to have negative values, but the aromatic rings may push the value toward less negative or slightly positive.
- Comparing to similar structures:
  - `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` (amide + aromatic): -217.140.
  - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (amide + aromatic): -1476.860.
  - `c1ccncc1` (pure aromatic): -860.321.

Given the symmetry and the urea core, the value is likely negative but not as extreme as `NC(=S)N`. A reasonable estimate is between **-200 and -500**.

### Final Prediction:
**-350.0** (estimated based on the trends in the given data). 

This is an educated guess, as the exact property is not explicitly defined in the examples, but the value aligns with the observed trends for urea-like structures with aromatic substituents.

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 628.6489245354994
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, aromaticity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, which is **fluorene**, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with three fused rings (two benzene rings fused to a central cyclopentadiene ring).

From the examples:
- **c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1** (a larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a high value of **1920.70446338**.
- **c1ccccc1** (benzene) is not explicitly listed, but simpler aromatic systems like **Sc1ccccc1** (thiophenol) have a value of **-248.84590102**, while **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (a diazo compound with two phenyl rings) has a very high value of **1206.25604479**.

Fluorene is less complex than the large polycyclic example but more complex than simple benzene derivatives. Its structure suggests a moderate-to-high property value due to its aromaticity and fused ring system.

Looking at similar-sized fused aromatics in the examples:
- **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (a complex heterocyclic with two phenyl rings) has a value of **683.59070582**.
- **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (two phenyl rings linked by a diazo group) has a value of **1206.25604479**.

Fluorene lacks heteroatoms or polar groups, which tend to increase the property value in some examples, but its fused rings contribute significantly. A reasonable estimate would be between **800 and 1200**. 

Given the examples, I predict the property value for **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (fluorene)** to be approximately **1100.00000000**. 

(Note: The exact value cannot be determined without knowing the specific property being measured, but this is a plausible estimate based on the given data.)

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -1983.124621616702
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse set of molecules and their corresponding property values, I can attempt to identify patterns or trends that might help predict the property for the new molecule: **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**.

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - Molecules with **halogens (Cl, Br)** often have higher positive values (e.g., ClC(=C(Cl)C(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl)Cl = 1654.68, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl = 1341.87).
   - Molecules with **long aliphatic chains** (e.g., CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC = 3906.13) have very high positive values.
   - Molecules with **oxygenated groups (e.g., alcohols, ethers, carbonyls)** tend to have negative values (e.g., CCCOCC = -619.96, OCc1ccccc1 = -793.75).
   - Molecules with **nitrogen-containing groups (e.g., amines, amides, nitro)** show mixed trends but often negative values (e.g., NNc1ccccc1 = -935.17, O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12 = -1210.22).
   - **Aromatic systems** with substitutions can have positive or negative values depending on other groups.

2. **Specific Features in the New Molecule**:
   - The molecule contains:
     - A **thiourea-like group (NC(=N)N)**.
     - A **sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O))**.
     - An **aromatic ring with an amine substituent (c1ccc(N)cc1)**.
   - The presence of multiple nitrogen and sulfur-oxygen groups suggests polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, which may correlate with negative values in the given data.

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12** (similar amide/aromatic structure) = -1210.22.
   - **NNc1ccccc1** (aromatic with nitrogens) = -935.17.
   - **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O** (nitrogen/sulfur heterocycle) = -1202.90.
   - The new molecule is more complex than these but shares features (nitrogens, aromaticity, polar groups).

4. **Prediction**:
   - Given the prevalence of nitrogen and sulfur-oxygen groups, the value is likely negative.
   - The sulfonamide and aromatic amine may contribute to a moderately large negative value.
   - A reasonable estimate would be between **-800 and -1200**, closer to the sulfonamide-like examples.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** is approximately **-1050.0**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given data trends. For precise predictions, computational or empirical methods would be needed.)

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1084.604130576485
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse set of molecules and their corresponding property values, I can attempt to predict the property for the new molecule by identifying structural patterns and trends in the provided data. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Training Data:
1. **Nitrated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has a value of **-710.61686224**.
   - `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` has a value of **478.05507572**.
   - Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) tend to reduce the property value unless balanced by other bulky/hydrophobic groups.

2. **Trifluoromethyl Groups (`CF3`)**:
   - The presence of `C(F)(F)F` (trifluoromethyl) is not directly seen in the training data, but fluorine substituents generally increase the property value (e.g., `C2(F)` in steroids increases values).

3. **Tertiary Amines (`N(CC)(CC)`)**:
   - `CCN(CC)c1ccccc1` has a value of **132.59921808**.
   - Tertiary amines with aromatic systems contribute moderately positive values.

4. **Combined Features**:
   - The new molecule has:
     - A tertiary amine (`CCN(CC(C)=C)`).
     - Two nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`).
     - A trifluoromethyl group (`C(F)(F)F`).
     - An aromatic system with substitution.

### Prediction Approach:
- The tertiary amine with an aromatic system suggests a baseline of ~100–300 (similar to `CCN(CC)c1ccccc1` or `CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23` at 335.67).
- The two nitro groups will significantly reduce the value (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` is -710.61, but this is a phenol with one nitro; two nitro groups could double the reduction).
- The trifluoromethyl group (`C(F)(F)F`) will offset some of this reduction due to its hydrophobic/electron-withdrawing nature (likely adding ~200–400 based on halogen trends in the data).

### Estimated Value:
Given the competing effects:
- Baseline (tertiary amine + aromatic): ~200.
- Two nitro groups: subtract ~700 (each nitro subtracts ~350).
- Trifluoromethyl group: add ~300.
- Net effect: `200 - 700 + 300 = -200`.

However, the presence of the `CC(C)=C` group (unsaturated hydrocarbon) may further increase the value (similar to `CCCCCCCC=C` at 816.87, but smaller here). Adjusting for this, the final value is likely **positive but small**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the complexity, I predict a value of **~250–350**, similar to nitrated aromatic amines in the training set. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 312.45678901** (hypothetical interpolation). 

(Note: Without a clear linear trend or model, this is an approximate guess based on structural analogies.)

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -1211.8665380248972
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** by comparing its structural features to those of the molecules in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Structural Features of CC(C)OC=O**:
   - It is an ester (R-O-C=O) with a branched alkyl group (isopropyl, **CC(C)**) attached to the oxygen.
   - The molecule is small (4 carbons, 1 oxygen, and a carbonyl group).

2. **Similar Molecules in the Dataset**:
   - **CC(C)CCOC=O** (property: -775.54805829): This is a similar ester but with a longer alkyl chain (branched butyl group). The property is negative and moderately large in magnitude.
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (property: -611.3385003): This is an ester with an aromatic ring and an amine substituent. The property is negative but less so than the aliphatic ester above.
   - **CCCCCOC(=O)C** (property: -410.04495045): This is another aliphatic ester with a longer chain. The property is negative but smaller in magnitude than the first example.
   - **CC(=O)N** (property: -1948.20956435): This is an amide (not an ester), but it has a carbonyl group and is small. The property is very negative, likely due to the amide group's polarity.

3. **Trends**:
   - Aliphatic esters tend to have negative property values in this dataset.
   - Smaller esters (like **CC(C)OC=O**) may have more negative values than larger ones (e.g., **CCCCCOC(=O)C** has -410.04, while **CC(C)CCOC=O** has -775.55).
   - Branching may slightly affect the property, but the dominant factor seems to be the presence of the ester group and size.

4. **Prediction**:
   - **CC(C)OC=O** is smaller than **CC(C)CCOC=O** (which has -775.55) but larger than **CC(=O)N** (which has -1948.21). 
   - Given that it is a small ester with branching, I would expect its property to be more negative than **CC(C)CCOC=O** but less extreme than **CC(=O)N**.
   - A reasonable estimate would be between -800 and -1000.

**Final Prediction**: The property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is approximately **-900.0**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples provided. The actual value could vary depending on the specific property being predicted, which is not explicitly stated in the question.)

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -225.76077398752025
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** by comparing its structural features to those of the molecules in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Structural Features of **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**:
1. **Aromatic ring (benzene)**: Present in many examples, often contributing positively to the property value unless offset by other groups.
2. **Methyl groups (-CH3)**: Two methyl substituents (electron-donating, hydrophobic). In the examples:
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1** (toluene derivative) has a property value of **149.44438191**.
   - **Cc1ccccc1C** (xylene derivative) has a value of **149.44438191** (same as above, likely a duplicate entry).
3. **Hydroxyl group (-OH)**: Electron-donating/polar. In the examples:
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol) has a value of **-647.8067063**.
   - Other molecules with -OH (e.g., polyhydroxybenzenes) tend to have negative values (e.g., **-1196.67715391** for gallic acid derivative).

### Observations:
- Methyl groups alone (e.g., toluene/xylene) give modest positive values (~150).
- Adding -OH (phenol) drastically reduces the value to **-647.8067063**.
- The molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** is a dimethylphenol (specifically, 3,5-dimethylphenol), so it has both methyl and hydroxyl effects.

### Prediction:
- The hydroxyl group will dominate, pulling the value negative, but the two methyl groups will offset this slightly compared to phenol.
- From the examples, phenol is **-647.8067063**, and toluene is **149.44438191**. A rough estimate for 3,5-dimethylphenol would be between these values, likely closer to phenol but less negative due to the methyl groups.

### Estimated Value:
Given the trends, I predict the property value for **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** to be approximately:  
**-400.0** (with uncertainty, likely between **-300** and **-500**).

However, looking for closer analogs:
- **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3** has a value of **-84.49950172**, but this is a much larger polyhydroxy structure.
- **c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC** has a value of **603.19644305**, but this is a long alkyl chain with -OH.

Given the lack of a direct analog, my best estimate is:  
**-450.0** (closer to phenol but adjusted for methyl groups). 

### Final Predicted Value:
**-450.0** (approximate). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., energy, solubility, etc.—this is a rough interpolation based on the given examples.)

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 871.6927545023044
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might help us estimate the value.

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Phosphorothioate Derivatives (P(=S))**: 
   - Molecules with the **P(=S)** group tend to have relatively large positive property values. For example:
     - **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl**: 1582.56961521
     - **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl**: 1474.53341017
     - **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: 1507.92268697
   - These values are all in the range of ~1475-1583.

2. **Substituent Effects**:
   - The presence of **Cl**, **Br**, or **I** seems to increase the property value significantly.
   - In the target molecule, we have **SC** (thioether) and **C** (methyl) substituents instead of halogens. Thioethers (S-R) are less electronegative than halogens, so we might expect a slightly lower value than the halogenated examples.

3. **Aromatic Ring Substitution**:
   - The target molecule has a substituted phenyl ring (**Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**), similar to some of the given examples but with **SC** and **C** instead of halogens or other groups.
   - For comparison:
     - **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1**: 246.314337 (smaller value due to no P(=S) group)
     - **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: 1507.92268697 (large value due to P(=S) and Cl substituents).

4. **Thioether (SC) Contribution**:
   - The **SC** group is less polarizable than halogens but still contributes to the property value. It may reduce the value compared to fully halogenated examples but keep it in a similar range.

### Prediction:
Given that the target molecule has:
- A **P(=S)** group (like the high-value examples).
- Aromatic substitution with **SC** and **C** (less electron-withdrawing than halogens but still significant).

We can estimate the property value to be slightly lower than the fully halogenated phosphorothioates but still in the same general range. A reasonable prediction would be around **1400-1500**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1: ~1450.0**  
*(This is an approximate estimate based on the trends observed in the given data.)*

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 2929.4985146834915
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a property value of **3376.55903633**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a property value of **3823.61955798**.
   - These molecules are structurally similar to the target molecule, with multiple chlorine substitutions on aromatic rings. The property value increases with the number of chlorine atoms and the complexity of the aromatic system.

2. **Target Molecule Analysis**:
   - The target molecule is **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**.
   - It has **6 chlorine atoms** attached to two fused aromatic rings (a biphenyl-like structure with chlorines at various positions).
   - Compared to the examples:
     - It has fewer chlorines than **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (8 chlorines, value = 3823.62) but more than **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (6 chlorines, value = 3376.56).
     - The arrangement of chlorines is slightly less symmetric than the example with 6 chlorines, which might slightly reduce the property value.

3. **Interpolation**:
   - The example with 6 chlorines (3376.56) is a good reference, but the target molecule has a slightly less dense chlorine substitution pattern (not all positions are fully substituted).
   - The example with 8 chlorines (3823.62) suggests that each additional chlorine adds roughly ~100-150 to the property value. Thus, removing 2 chlorines might reduce the value by ~200-300.

### Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** should be slightly lower than **3376.55903633** (the 6-chlorine example) but still in the same range. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 3200.0** (rounded to one decimal place for simplicity, but the exact value would likely be between 3100 and 3300 based on the trend).

However, since the example with 6 chlorines is 3376.56 and the target molecule is very similar (same number of chlorines but slightly less symmetric), a more precise prediction would be slightly lower, say:

**Final predicted property value: 3300.0** (to reflect the structural similarity to the 3376.56 example but account for minor differences). 

But given the exact examples, the closest match is the 6-chlorine case (3376.56), so the prediction should be very close to this. 

Thus, the most accurate prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 3376.55903633** (same as the 6-chlorine example, as the structures are nearly identical in substitution pattern). 

However, the target molecule has one less chlorine on the second ring (it's **cccc2Cl** instead of **c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**), so the value should be slightly lower. Adjusting for this:

Subtract ~100 for the missing chlorine, giving:

**Predicted property value: 3276.55903633**

But to match the precision of the examples, we'll keep more decimal places:

**Predicted property value: 3276.55903633**

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -1139.8195944532952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Nitro groups (NO2)**: Often appear with negative property values when attached to aromatic rings (e.g., `N(=O)=O` in `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` has a value of `-634.80678296`). However, nitro groups on aliphatic chains are less common in the examples.
   - **Aliphatic chains**: Simple alkanes like `CCC` have a negative value (`-631.31732985`), while longer chains like `CCCCCCCCC` have positive values (`970.13638452`).
   - **Polar groups**: Molecules with polar groups (e.g., `OH`, `C=O`, `Cl`) tend to have more extreme values (either highly positive or negative).

2. **Specific Examples**:
   - `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` has a positive value (`1237.86638471`), but this is a complex molecule with multiple nitro and trifluoromethyl groups.
   - `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (dinitrile) has a negative value (`-621.97106918`), suggesting that polar groups can lead to negative values.
   - `CCCN(=O)=O` is a simpler aliphatic nitro compound, so we might expect a value closer to other small polar aliphatics.

3. **Simpler Nitro Compounds**:
   - The closest example is `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (trinitrobenzene) with a value of `-634.80678296`, but this is aromatic and has multiple nitro groups.
   - `CCCN(=O)=O` has only one nitro group and is aliphatic, so its value should be less extreme.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Aliphatic chains with polar groups (like `CCC=O` or `CCCN`) tend to have negative values.
- The nitro group is highly polar and often associated with negative values in the examples.
- The molecule is small (3-carbon chain with one nitro group).

A reasonable estimate for **CCCN(=O)=O** would be between `-400` and `-800`. Given the simplicity of the molecule, I predict a value closer to the middle of this range.

**Predicted property value: -600.0** (rounded to one decimal place for simplicity). 

This is an educated guess based on the trends in the provided data. For a more precise prediction, statistical modeling or additional examples would be needed.

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 170.50425772120846
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structures with their property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogen Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br, F) often have positive property values, especially when multiple halogens are present. For example:
     - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: 522.39165638 (one Cl and one Br)
     - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: 2482.43799303 (multiple Cl atoms)
     - **BrC(Br)Br**: 79.16269108 (three Br atoms)
   - The presence of halogens seems to increase the property value, with heavier halogens (Br) having a larger effect than lighter ones (Cl, F).

2. **Aromatic Rings with Halogens**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: 522.39165638 (one Cl and one Br on benzene)
   - **COc1cccc(Cl)c1**: 6.56838232 (one Cl on benzene with a methoxy group)
   - **COc1ccccc1Cl**: 6.56838232 (same as above, Cl at different position)
   - **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is analogous to these, with one F and one Br on a benzene ring.

3. **Effect of Fluorine vs. Chlorine/Bromine**:
   - Fluorine is less heavy than chlorine or bromine, so its contribution to the property value is likely smaller. For example:
     - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: 522.39165638 (Cl + Br)
     - If we replace Cl with F, the property value should decrease because F is less heavy than Cl.

4. **Other Functional Groups**:
   - The presence of other functional groups (e.g., NO2, COOH, etc.) can significantly alter the property value, but **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** has no such groups.

### Prediction for Fc1cccc(Br)c1:
- The molecule is a benzene ring with one F and one Br substitution. 
- Compare to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (Cl + Br, property = 522.39165638). 
- Replacing Cl with F (lighter halogen) should reduce the property value. 
- Fluorine is less heavy than chlorine, so the property value should be lower than 522.39165638 but still positive because of the Br. 
- From the examples, **BrC(Br)Br** (three Br) is 79.16269108, and **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (one Cl + one Br) is 522.39165638. The presence of Br seems to contribute significantly. 
- A reasonable estimate for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** would be between 100 and 400, closer to the lower end because F is less impactful than Cl.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** is approximately **350.0**. 

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples provided. For a more accurate prediction, a larger dataset or a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model would be needed.)

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -99.55204453625944
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, I observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, halogens, and heteroatoms. The property tends to be more positive for larger, more complex, or aromatic systems, while simpler or highly polar molecules (e.g., with multiple halogens or electronegative atoms) often have more negative values.

Let's analyze the target molecule: **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**  
- This is a bicyclic structure with two fused rings (a decalin-like framework).  
- It has two tertiary carbons (C1 with two methyl groups) and a hydroxyl group (OH), which introduces polarity.  
- The molecule is moderately complex but lacks highly polarizing features like halogens or multiple heteroatoms.  

Comparing to similar examples:  
1. **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO** (property = 54.59967803): This is a much more complex steroid-like molecule with multiple functional groups (ketone, alcohol, fluorine). Our target is simpler but shares some features (fused rings, OH group).  
2. **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2** (property = 2582.40056147): This is highly complex with aromatic rings, halogens, and ester groups, so it's not a good comparison.  
3. **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** (property = -303.30873775): This is another steroid-like molecule with ketone and alcohol groups, but our target lacks ketones and has fewer polar groups.  

Given the target's moderate complexity and single OH group, I estimate its property value to be between the simpler aliphatic examples (e.g., **CCCC(C)(C)O** = -534.77579388) and the more complex fused-ring systems.  

### Predicted property value: **-200.0**  
This reflects its intermediate complexity and limited polarity. The exact value is uncertain without a clear trend, but this is a reasonable estimate based on the given data.  

(Note: The property appears to be a computed or experimental value like molecular polarizability or a quantum-chemical energy, but without explicit labeling, this is an educated guess.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 164.9621851387777
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that might help us estimate the property value.

### Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: 
   - The molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** has a property value of **1053.13063196**. This molecule shares a similar phosphorothioate (P(=S)) group with the target molecule, though it has an additional **SC(CCl)** substituent.
   - The target molecule lacks the **SC(CCl)** group but retains the **P(=S)(OCC)** and **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (phthalimide-like) structure.

2. **Aromatic and Carbonyl Contributions**:
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., **c1ccccc1**) and carbonyl groups (e.g., **C(=O)**) tend to have positive property values unless strongly offset by electronegative or polar groups (e.g., **NO2**, **OH**, halogens).
   - The phthalimide-like fragment (**N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**) is present in both the example and the target molecule, suggesting a significant positive contribution.

3. **Simpler Phosphorothioate Example**:
   - The example with **P(=S)(OCC)** has a value of **1053.13063196**, but it includes an additional **SC(CCl)** group, which likely increases the property value due to the sulfur and chlorine atoms.
   - The target molecule lacks this **SC(CCl)** group, so we might expect a slightly lower value.

4. **Other Substituents**:
   - The **OCC** (ethoxy) groups are present in both the example and the target molecule and do not drastically alter the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the similarities, the target molecule's property value is likely slightly lower than **1053.13063196** due to the absence of the **SC(CCl)** group. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **900–1000**.

### Final Prediction:
**950.0** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the given data). 

*Note: Without a clear mathematical model or additional examples, this is an educated guess based on the closest structural analog in the provided data.*

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -584.7091836412134
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Heteroatoms**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings containing nitrogen or oxygen (e.g., pyridine, pyrrole, or carbonyl groups) tend to have property values that are either moderately positive or negative, depending on the substituents and conjugation.
   - Example: `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2` has a value of **-1102.10613263**, while `c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32` has **671.95919546**.

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - The presence of a carbonyl group (especially in conjugated systems) often leads to negative property values unless balanced by other stabilizing features (e.g., aromaticity or bulky substituents).
   - Example: `CCC(=O)C` has **-926.14190711**, while `O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has **395.88187607** (due to conjugation with two aromatic rings).

3. **Substituent Effects**:
   - Methyl groups (`C`) or alkyl chains tend to slightly increase the property value unless paired with strongly electron-withdrawing groups.
   - Example: `Cc1cccc(C)c1C` has **186.69258331**, while `CNc1ccccc1` has **-417.84490446** (due to the electron-donating `N`).

4. **Bicyclic or Fused Aromatic Systems**:
   - Fused aromatic systems (e.g., naphthalene-like structures) often have high positive values.
   - Example: `C1Cc2c3c1cccc3cc4c2ccc5ccccc54` has **1988.16722346**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** has:
- A fused bicyclic structure with two nitrogen atoms and a carbonyl group (`C=O`).
- Two methyl groups (`C`) attached to the nitrogens.
- One aromatic ring (benzene) fused to a diazepine-like ring with a carbonyl.

Given the conjugation, the carbonyl group would typically reduce the property value, but the aromaticity and methyl groups may offset this. Comparing to similar molecules:
- `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (no carbonyl, fused nitrogens) has **-1102.10613263**.
- `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC` (multiple carbonyls) has **-789.57429137**.
- `c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32` (fused aromatic with nitrogen) has **671.95919546**.

The target molecule is intermediate: it has a carbonyl (reducing effect) but also aromatic conjugation and methyl groups (increasing effect). A reasonable estimate is slightly positive.

### Predicted Property Value:
**453.99837547** (similar to `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O`, which also has a fused aromatic system with carbonyl and methyl groups). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** is:
**453.99837547**

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -143.13599805488286
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, it appears that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including functional groups, molecular weight, and possibly other factors like polarity or hydrogen bonding potential. 

Let's analyze the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl hexanoate):

1. **Functional Groups**: It contains an ester group (-COO-) and an alkyl chain (hexyl group).
2. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - Similar to **CCC(=O)OC** (methyl butanoate, though not explicitly listed, but analogous to esters like **CCOC(=O)N**, which has a value of -1530.84360444, but this is a carbamate, not a direct ester).
   - Esters with longer alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**, octyl acetate) have a value of 390.68190674.
   - The presence of the ester group seems to contribute positively to the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons (e.g., **CCCCC**, -97.49942506).

3. **Trends**:
   - Longer alkyl chains increase the property value (e.g., **CCCCCCCI**, 720.33259442).
   - Esters with moderate chain lengths (like ethyl hexanoate) likely fall between simple hydrocarbons and larger esters.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Ethyl hexanoate has a 6-carbon alkyl chain and an ethyl ester group. Given the examples, a reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (390.68190674) but higher than simple hydrocarbons.
   - A plausible value is **~300 to 400**.

**Final predicted property value for CCCCCC(=O)OCC: 350.0** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., dipole moment, heat of formation, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -592.3859804776176
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with the molecular structure, including functional groups, aromaticity, halogens, and other substituents. 

The molecule in question is **COC(=O)c1ccccc1**, which is methyl benzoate. Structurally, it consists of a benzene ring with an ester group (–COOCH3). 

From the examples, we can compare this to similar molecules:
1. **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) has a property value of **-325.47702808**.
2. **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate) has a property value of **-526.90741923**.

The presence of the ester group (–COOR) in aromatic systems tends to give negative property values in the range of ~ -300 to -500, depending on additional substituents. Since methyl benzoate is simpler than ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate but very similar to ethyl benzoate, we can expect its value to be close to that of ethyl benzoate but slightly more negative due to the shorter alkyl chain (methyl vs. ethyl).

### Predicted property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1**:  
**-350.0** (approximate, based on the trend observed in the examples).  

This is a reasonable estimate given the data, though the exact value may depend on finer structural details not explicitly captured in the examples.
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -404.0239333241318
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as branching, unsaturation (double or triple bonds), and presence of heteroatoms (e.g., Cl, Br, N, O, S). 

For the molecule **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), we can analyze its features:
1. It is a simple linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds (conjugated diene).
2. It lacks heteroatoms or complex functional groups.
3. It is less complex than many of the examples with higher property values (e.g., aromatic rings, halogens, or multiple functional groups).

Comparing to similar molecules in the examples:
- **C/C=C/C** (butene) has a property value of **-250.76167919**.
- **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene) has a property value of **-6.43154102**.
- **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene) has a property value of **205.33036815**.

1,3-Butadiene is simpler than propylbenzene but has more unsaturation than butene. The presence of conjugated double bonds may slightly increase the property value compared to butene but not as much as aromatic systems. 

Given this, a reasonable estimate for **C=CCC=C** would be slightly higher than **C/C=C/C** but lower than **C=Cc1ccccc1**. 

**Predicted property value for C=CCC=C: -200.0** (approximate, based on interpolation of the given examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. The property could be related to molecular polarizability, boiling point, or another descriptor, but the exact nature isn't specified.)

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 79.1626910848464
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobenzene derivative) has a very high property value (**3823.61955798**), indicating that heavy halogenation (especially with chlorine) increases the property value significantly.
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a property value of **864.35806091**, which is high but not as extreme as the heavily chlorinated example.
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (a bromo-chloro-fluoro compound) has a much lower value (**115.97300034**), suggesting that mixed halogens or lighter halogens (F) reduce the property value compared to pure bromine/chlorine.

2. **Bromine-Specific Trends**:
   - The presence of bromine tends to contribute positively to the property value, but the magnitude depends on the number of bromine atoms and the molecular complexity.
   - **BrC(Br)Br** is a simple, symmetric molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a single carbon. This is analogous to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** but with all halogens being bromine (heavier), so we expect a higher value than **115.97300034** but not as high as **864.35806091** (bromonaphthalene, which has a larger aromatic system).

3. **Simple Halomethanes**:
   - No direct examples of simple bromomethanes are given, but we can infer from the trend that adding bromine increases the property value. For instance:
     - **CCC=O** (a small aldehyde) has a very negative value (**-1193.0508595**), while **BrC(Br)Br** is a heavier, halogenated version of a small molecule, so it should be much higher.

### Prediction:
Given the symmetry and the three heavy bromine atoms in **BrC(Br)Br**, the property value is likely to be moderately high but not extreme (since it lacks aromaticity or additional complexity). A reasonable estimate would be between the value of **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br (115.97300034)** and **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (864.35806091)**. 

Given that **BrC(Br)Br** is simpler than bromonaphthalene but has three bromines, a plausible prediction is:

**Predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br: 420.00000000**  

(This is an approximate interpolation based on the given examples. The actual value may vary, but this is a reasonable ballpark estimate given the data.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 1053.1306319602104
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphate-like core (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)**: 
   - Similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 1363.55511723), which has a thiophosphate group (P=S) with sulfur and alkoxy substituents. 
   - The presence of **P(=S)** and **OCC** groups suggests a significant positive contribution to the property value.

2. **Thioether linkage (SC(CCl))**: 
   - The **S** atom bonded to a **C-Cl** group may add to the property value, similar to how sulfur-containing groups in other molecules (e.g., **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**) contribute.

3. **Lactam/cyclic amide (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**:
   - This is a phthalimide-like structure (two carbonyls attached to a nitrogen in a ring). 
   - Compare to **OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O** (property = 521.57060859), which also has a cyclic amide and aromatic rings.

4. **Ethoxy groups (CCOP and OCC)**:
   - These are relatively simple alkyl ethers, which tend to have modest contributions (e.g., **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has a property = -503.30229526, but the nitro group dominates here).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The molecule is most similar to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 1363.55511723), but with additional complexity:
  - Replacing the **SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)** part with **SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (a bulkier, more polar group).
  - The phthalimide moiety is likely to increase the property value compared to the simpler amide in the reference molecule.

### Estimated Property Value:
Given the similarities and differences:
1. The **P(=S)(OCC)OCC** core is very similar to the reference (property ~1363).
2. The **SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** group is more complex than the reference's **SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)** and likely adds to the property value.
3. The aromatic and carbonyl groups in the phthalimide will contribute positively.

Thus, the property value should be **higher than 1363.55511723** but not as extreme as some of the very large values (e.g., 3823). A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1800.0** (rounded to one decimal place as a plausible interpolation based on the given data). 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., energy, polarizability, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on structural trends in the provided examples. The value is likely in the range of **1500–2000** given the complexity and functional groups.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 363.24522642130694
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse set of molecules and their corresponding property values, I can attempt to predict the property for the new molecule by identifying structural patterns and functional groups that correlate with the property values in the provided examples. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Large, complex polycyclic structures** (e.g., steroids or fused rings) tend to have **high positive values** (e.g., 2168.79, 1711.27, 2759.40).
2. **Simple aliphatic chains** or small molecules with few functional groups often have **moderate negative values** (e.g., -95.17, -250.76, -196.09).
3. **Aromatic systems** (e.g., benzene rings, fused aromatics) with simple substituents can have **moderate positive or negative values** depending on the substituents:
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro `N(=O)=O`, halogens) often correlate with **negative values** (e.g., -298.16, -795.04, -62.12).
   - Electron-donating groups (e.g., hydroxyl `OH`, alkyl) can lead to **less negative or positive values** (e.g., 331.85, -409.90).
4. **Highly polar or charged groups** (e.g., `N(=O)=O`, `S(=O)(=O)`, `NC(=S)N`) tend to **decrease the property value** (e.g., -2186.11, -682.08, -1689.51).
5. **Halogens (Cl, Br, I)** can have mixed effects:
   - Multiple halogens on aromatics often **increase the value** (e.g., 1588.32, 1341.87, 2482.44).
   - Single halogens on small aliphatics can **decrease the value** (e.g., -331.77, -491.88).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
`CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C`

1. **Structural Features**:
   - A **urea-like fragment**: `C(=O)N` (similar to `NC(=O)N` in examples, which has negative values).
   - A **chlorinated aromatic ring**: `c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)` (chlorine on aromatic tends to increase value, but depends on context).
   - A **fused heterocyclic system**: `n2nc(oc2=O)` (similar to `nc1nncn1` in examples, which has negative values).
   - **Bulky tert-butyl group**: `C(C)(C)C` (could increase steric bulk, but no clear trend in examples).
   - **N,N-dimethylamide**: `CN(C)C(=O)` (similar to `CN(C)C(=O)C` with value -1535.70).

2. **Combined Effects**:
   - The urea and amide fragments suggest a **negative contribution** (similar to `NC(=O)N` or `CN(C)C(=O)C`).
   - The chlorinated aromatic and heterocycle might **partially offset** the negative trend.
   - The molecule is **moderately large** but not as complex as the highest-value examples.

3. **Comparison to Similar Examples**:
   - `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` has a value of **-1443.27** (similar urea/amide).
   - `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` has a value of **56.79** (simpler aromatic system).
   - `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of **-62.12** (chloro-nitro aromatic).

### Prediction:
Given the presence of strongly negative contributors (urea, amide) and some positive contributors (chloroaromatic, heterocycle), the value is likely **moderately negative**, but not as extreme as the largest negative examples. 

**Predicted Property Value: -1200.0** (approximate, considering the balance of structural effects). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on trends in the data. The value could be refined with more examples or domain knowledge.)

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 1919.6781536452436
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and halogen substitutions (especially chlorine and bromine). The property tends to increase (become more positive) with more halogen atoms and aromatic systems, while polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., -OH, -NH₂, -CO) often correspond to more negative values.

For the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**:
1. It contains **two aromatic rings** linked by an **ether (O)**.
2. There are **three chlorine atoms** (two on one ring, one on the other).
3. There are **two hydroxyl groups (-OH)**.

Comparing to similar examples:
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (246.314337): One ring, two Cl, one OH.
- **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (1140.4353803): One ring, four Cl, one OH.
- **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2** (1588.31694974): Two rings, two Cl (no OH).

The given molecule has **more Cl atoms than the first example but fewer than the second**, and it has **two OH groups** (which may lower the property value compared to pure halogenated aromatics). The **two-ring system with ether linkage** is somewhat similar to the last example, but the OH groups add polarity.

Given these observations, I estimate the property value to be **between 800 and 1200**. A reasonable prediction would be:  
**~1100.0** (specific value: **1100.0**).  

This aligns with the trend where additional Cl and aromatic rings increase the value, while OH groups moderate it slightly.

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -250.76167919270853
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as branching, unsaturation, and presence of heteroatoms or halogens. 

The molecule in question is **CC/C=C\C**, which is **2-pentene** (specifically, the trans isomer due to the \ and / notation for the double bond). 

From the examples:
- **CC/C=C/C** (likely 2-butene) has a property value of **-250.76167919**.
- **CCCC(C)C** (a branched alkane) has a property value of **70.81537189**.
- **CCCCC(=O)CCCC** (a ketone) has a property value of **408.40285487**.
- **CCCCS** (a thioether) has a property value of **-426.05538236**.

The molecule **CC/C=C\C** is structurally similar to **CC/C=C/C** but has one additional carbon. The presence of the double bond (unsaturation) tends to lower the property value compared to saturated analogs (e.g., alkanes). 

Given that **CC/C=C/C** has a value of **-250.76167919**, and **CCCC(C)C** (a saturated analog) has a value of **70.81537189**, we can infer that the double bond reduces the property value by roughly **~320 units**. 

For **CC/C=C\C** (2-pentene), which is one carbon larger than **CC/C=C/C**, we might expect a slight increase in the property value due to the additional carbon, but the double bond would still have a significant reducing effect. 

A reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than **-250.76167919** but still negative. 

### Predicted property value for **CC/C=C\C**:  
**-200.0** (approximate, based on the trend).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The actual value could vary depending on the specific property's dependence on molecular features.)
==================================================
Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -619.9595020914405
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Ether Functional Group**: 
   - The molecule **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2** has a property value of **865.38437065**. This contains an ether linkage (O between two carbons) and other complex groups.
   - The molecule **COc1ccccc1O** (anisole-like with two ether linkages) has a value of **-641.92253047**.
   - The molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate) has a value of **-325.47702808**.

2. **Simple Ethers vs. Complex Ethers**:
   - Simple ethers (like **CCCOCC**) are likely to have property values between those of simple hydrocarbons and more complex ethers with additional functional groups.

3. **Hydrocarbon Analogues**:
   - **CCC(O)CC** (3-hexanol) has a value of **-801.68474628**. Replacing the OH with O (to form **CCCOCC**) would likely increase the property value because ethers are less polar than alcohols but still have some polarity.
   - **CCCCCC** (hexane) is not in the data, but **C1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexane) has a value of **268.00368278**. Linear alkanes would likely have lower values than cyclic ones.

4. **Trend for Ethers**:
   - Ethers seem to have property values that are higher than their corresponding alcohols (e.g., **CCC(O)CC** is -801.68, while **CCCOCC** would likely be less negative or positive).
   - The presence of the ether oxygen likely adds a positive contribution compared to pure hydrocarbons.

### Prediction for **CCCOCC**:
Given that:
- **CCC(O)CC** (alcohol) is **-801.68474628**,
- **C1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexane) is **268.00368278**,
- **CCCOCC** is a simple ether with no other functional groups,

The property value for **CCCOCC** is likely to be between these two values, closer to the alcohol but less negative because the ether oxygen is less polar than the alcohol OH. 

A reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than the alcohol but still negative or slightly positive. From the examples, simple ethers seem to have values in the range of **-500 to 200**.

Given the symmetry and simplicity of **CCCOCC**, I predict a value around **-200 to 100**. 

### Final Prediction:
After considering the trends, the predicted property value for **CCCOCC** is:  
**-150.0** (a reasonable interpolation based on the given data). 

However, looking more closely at the examples, **CC(C)COC(=O)C** (an ether with a ketone) is **-775.54805829**, and **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is **-325.47702808**. Since **CCCOCC** is simpler, its value is likely higher (less negative) than these. 

A more precise estimate is **-100.0**. 

But comparing to **CCC(O)CC** (-801.68) and noting that ethers are less polar than alcohols, a better estimate might be around **-400.0**. 

Given the uncertainty, the most plausible value based on the examples is:  
**-300.0**. 

However, this is still approximate. Given the data, the closest simple ether-like molecule is **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** at **-325.47702808**, so **CCCOCC** (simpler) might be slightly higher, say **-200.0**. 

After careful consideration, the predicted value is:  
**-250.0**. 

But to match the scale of the given examples more precisely, the final predicted value is:  
**-275.0**. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCOCC** is **-275.0**.

True Property: 977.5258146319861
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Structural Features of the Molecule:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **urea-like fragment** (`N(C=O)N`) with two aromatic rings (phenyl groups) attached to the nitrogen atoms. One phenyl is directly bonded to a tertiary carbon (`C(C)(C)`), and the other is part of a dimethyl-substituted amide (`N(C=O)`).
2. **Aromatic Systems**: Two phenyl rings (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`) are present, similar to many examples in the dataset (e.g., `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` with a property of 775.06911375).
3. **Substituents**: The molecule has bulky, hydrophobic groups (tertiary butyl and phenyl rings) and no strongly polar or charged groups (e.g., no nitro, hydroxyl, or halogens).

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **Example 1**: `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (two phenyl rings, no polar groups) has a property of **775.06911375**.
- **Example 2**: `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` (amide with phenyl rings and heterocycle) has a property of **683.59070582**.
- **Example 3**: `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23` (amide with aliphatic rings) has a property of **-175.63580641**.

### Observations:
1. The presence of **two phenyl rings** tends to increase the property value (e.g., 775.07 for biphenyl-like structures).
2. **Amides/ureas** with aromatic groups often have values in the **middle range** (e.g., 683.59 for the amide with phenyl rings).
3. The **tertiary butyl group** (`C(C)(C)`) adds steric bulk but no strong electronic effects, which may slightly increase the value compared to simpler amides.

### Adjustments:
- The given molecule is more similar to `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` (683.59) but lacks the heterocycle (`nc2ccccc2s1`), which likely reduces complexity. The tertiary butyl group may offset this reduction.
- The absence of polar groups (like nitro or hydroxyl) prevents extreme negative values (e.g., -562.40 for nitrophenols).

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, a reasonable estimate is **slightly higher than 683.59** due to the additional bulky group. A plausible prediction is:

**Predicted Property Value: 720.0** (rounded to one decimal place as a conservative estimate based on structural analogs).

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., energy, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical guess based on the trend that **bulky aromatic systems with amide linkages** tend to have values in the **hundreds to low thousands** in the provided dataset. The value 720.0 aligns with this trend.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 46.86814467858211
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Bromine (Br) Substituents**: 
   - Molecules with Br substituents tend to have property values that are moderately negative or positive, depending on other functional groups. For example:
     - `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` has a value of **170.50425772** (positive).
     - `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` has a value of **-126.09925641** (negative).
     - `c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1` has a very high positive value (**1118.74603451**), likely due to multiple Br atoms.

2. **Amide Group (N-C=O)**:
   - Molecules with amide groups (e.g., `CC(=O)N...`) often have negative property values. For example:
     - `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has a value of **977.52581463**, but this is likely due to the bulky aromatic groups overriding the amide effect.
     - Simpler amides (like acetamide derivatives) are not directly present in the examples, but the trend suggests amides contribute to negative values.

3. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**:
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Br, NO2) tend to have negative values, while those with electron-donating groups (e.g., alkyl) tend to have positive values. For example:
     - `Cc1cccc(C)c1C` (alkyl substituents) has **186.69258331**.
     - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (NO2 substituent) has **-509.18647109**.

4. **Combined Effects**:
   - The molecule `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` has:
     - An amide group (negative contribution).
     - A bromine substituent on the aromatic ring (could be positive or slightly negative).
     - No strongly electron-donating groups to offset the amide's effect.

### Prediction:
Given the amide group's likely negative contribution and the bromine's moderate effect (as seen in `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` with **-126.09925641**), I predict the property value for `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` will be **negative and moderately large**, similar to other amide-containing molecules but adjusted for the bromine's presence.

From the examples, the closest analog is `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (**-126.09925641**), but with the added amide group, the value should be more negative. A reasonable estimate is between **-200 and -500**. 

Given the data, I predict:  
**-350.0** (specific value chosen based on interpolation of trends).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** is **-350.0**.
==================================================
Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 373.64516509451073
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular size, functional groups, and structural features (e.g., aromatic rings, halogens, polar groups, etc.). 

The molecule in question is **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, which is isobutylbenzene. It consists of a benzene ring with an isobutyl substituent (a branched alkyl group). 

From the examples:
- **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene) has a property value of **-521.21482122**.
- **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene) has a property value of **149.44438191**.
- **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene) has a property value of **533.28422373**.
- **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene) has a property value of **-6.43154102**.

The isobutyl group (**CC(C)C-**) is larger than ethyl or isopropyl but less polar. Given the trend where larger alkyl substituents on benzene tend to increase the property value (e.g., ethyltoluene > toluene, isopropyltoluene > ethyltoluene), we can infer that **isobutylbenzene** would have a higher value than isopropyltoluene but not drastically so, as branching may slightly reduce the contribution compared to a linear chain.

A reasonable estimate would be slightly higher than **533.28422373** (isopropyltoluene), but not as high as molecules with multiple aromatic rings or halogens (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24** has **1920.70446338**).

**Predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1: ~600–700**. 

A more precise interpolation suggests a value around **650**. 

However, looking at the jump from ethyltoluene (149.44) to isopropyltoluene (533.28), the increase is ~384. For isobutylbenzene, the increase might be slightly less due to branching, so adding ~300 to isopropyltoluene's value gives **~833**. 

But this seems high compared to other examples. Alternatively, averaging the trend: 

- Toluene: -521.21  
- Ethyltoluene: +149.44 (Δ = +670.65)  
- Isopropyltoluene: +533.28 (Δ = +383.84 from ethyltoluene)  
- Isobutylbenzene: Likely Δ = +200–300 from isopropyltoluene → **733–833**.  

Given the data, a reasonable prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: ~750**.  

But reviewing the examples again, **N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenylamine) has **746.6061237**, and isobutylbenzene is less polar but similar in size. Thus, a slightly lower value is plausible.  

Final prediction:  
**Predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1: ~700**.  

However, the closest structurally similar example is **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (533.28), and adding a methylene group (**CC(C)C-** vs **CC(C)-**) might increase the value by ~150–200, leading to:  
**Predicted value: ~700**.  

Given the uncertainty, I’d estimate:  
**700 ± 50**.  

**Final answer: 700.0** (rounded to one decimal place).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical interpolation. The true value could vary, but this is a reasonable guess based on the given data.)  

**Predicted property value: 700.0**

Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -574.6650323436718
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with the molecular structure, including functional groups, aromaticity, and substituents. 

The molecule in question is **O=Cc1ccccc1**, which is benzaldehyde (an aromatic aldehyde). Let's analyze the trends from the examples:

1. **Aromatic rings with simple substituents**:
   - **COc1ccccc1** (anisole) has a property value of **-440.49213933**.
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a high value of **2325.07049995**.
   - **c1cncnc1** (a heteroaromatic) has a value of **-1274.26617006**.

2. **Carbonyl-containing aromatic compounds**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (a substituted benzamide) has a value of **-1264.34517594**.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene) has a value of **-571.99662703**.

3. **Benzaldehyde-like structures**:
   The closest example is **O=Cc1ccccc1**, which is simpler than many of the provided examples but shares similarities with carbonyl-containing aromatics.

Given that benzaldehyde is less polar than nitrobenzene or amides but more polar than simple ethers like anisole, and considering the examples:
- Anisole: **-440.49213933**
- Dinitrobenzene: **-571.99662703**
- A benzamide: **-1264.34517594**

Benzaldehyde is likely to have a property value between anisole and dinitrobenzene, but closer to anisole because it lacks strongly electron-withdrawing groups like nitro or amide.

### Predicted property value for **O=Cc1ccccc1**:  
**-500.0** (approximate, based on interpolation from the examples).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., energy, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data.)

Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -1550.0698068515158
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule `O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2` by analyzing structural features and trends in the data. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`)** tend to increase the property value significantly when present (e.g., `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` has a high value of 1611.24).
2. **Heterocycles with nitrogen atoms** (e.g., pyridine, imidazole) often contribute to higher or lower values depending on the context. For example:
   - `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2` has a very negative value (-1102.11).
   - `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2` is also negative (-944.96).
3. **Urea-like fragments (`N-C(=O)-N`)** or amides tend to increase the property value (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has a high value of 977.53).
4. **Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups** (e.g., nitro, halogens) often increase the value, while simple hydrocarbons or alcohols tend to decrease it.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule `O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2` has the following features:
1. A **nitro group (`N(=O)=O`)** attached to an aromatic ring (increases value).
2. A **fused heterocycle with two amide-like (`N-C(=O)-N`)** groups (similar to hydantoin or imidazolidinedione), which may increase the value.
3. An **aromatic system** with an oxygen heteroatom (furanyl-like), which could contribute moderately.
4. The overall structure is polar and conjugated, which often correlates with higher values in the examples.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- The nitro-aromatic + heterocycle combination is somewhat similar to `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` (1611.24), but the target molecule has more nitrogen and carbonyl groups.
- The `N-C(=O)-N` fragment is similar to `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (977.53), but the target lacks the phenyl groups.
- The heterocycle is somewhat like `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2` (-944.96), but the target has carbonyls and nitro, which should increase the value.

### Prediction:
Given the strong contributions from the nitro group and the amide-like heterocycle, I predict a **high positive value**. The exact value is harder to pin down, but based on the examples, it should be in the range of **800–1200**. 

A reasonable estimate would be:  
**Predicted property value: 1050.0**  
(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarities and trends in the data. For precise predictions, computational methods or a larger training set would be needed.)
==================================================
Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 538.1968263382932
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **-732.23778737**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (a diazo-linked biphenyl) has a property value of **1206.25604479**.

2. **Structural Similarity**:
   - The target molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is a hydrazine derivative with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. This is structurally similar to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, but with a single bond between the nitrogens instead of a double bond.

3. **Effect of Nitrogen Bonding**:
   - Single-bonded nitrogen (as in hydrazine derivatives) tends to have a lower (more negative) property value compared to double-bonded nitrogen (as in diazo compounds). For example:
     - **Nc1ccccc1** (single N-C bond): **-732.23778737**
     - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (double N=N bond): **1206.25604479**

4. **Prediction**:
   - The target molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is intermediate between these two cases. It has a single N-N bond but two aromatic rings, which would increase the property value compared to aniline but keep it lower than the diazo compound.
   - A reasonable estimate would be slightly positive but much lower than the diazo compound. Given the examples, a value around **500-800** seems plausible.

### Final Prediction:
Based on the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is:

**600.0** (approximate, as exact interpolation is not possible without a clear trendline). 

However, looking more closely at the examples, the diazo compound **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** has a value of **1206.25604479**, and the single-N compound **Nc1ccccc1** has **-732.23778737**. The target molecule is halfway in bonding, so a rough average would be:

(1206.25604479 + (-732.23778737)) / 2 ≈ **237.0**.

But this seems too low. Alternatively, the presence of two phenyl rings might additively contribute, suggesting a value closer to **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** but reduced due to the single bond. A better estimate is:

**800.0** (conservative, accounting for structural similarity to the diazo compound but with reduced contribution from the single bond).

Given the uncertainty, the most plausible value based on the examples is:

**750.0** (intermediate between the diazo and aniline cases). 

However, since the diazo compound is **1206.25604479** and the target is similar but with a single bond, a reasonable prediction is:

**800.0**. 

But to be precise, let's note that the diazo compound is **1206.25604479**, and the single-N compound is **-732.23778737**. The target is not a direct average but likely closer to the diazo compound due to the two phenyl rings. Thus, a final prediction is:

**1000.0**. 

After reconsidering, the most consistent value based on the examples is:

**900.0**. 

### Final Answer:
**900.0** (approximate prediction based on structural similarity to the given examples). 

However, looking back at **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (1206.25604479) and **Nc1ccccc1** (-732.23778737), the target molecule is likely closer to the diazo compound but with a penalty for the single bond. A refined estimate is:

**800.0**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is:

**800.0**. 

But given the examples, the most accurate prediction is:

**750.0**. 

After careful consideration, the final predicted value is:

**750.0**. 

### Exact Prediction:
Given the data and trends, the property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is predicted to be:

**750.0**.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -1660.021790060979
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2** by analyzing structural patterns and their associated property values in the training data. Here's my reasoning:

### Structural Analysis:
The molecule is a cyclic imide with two carbonyl groups (C=O) attached to nitrogen (N) and a cyclopentane ring (CCCC1) fused to the imide structure. This is a relatively rigid, polar, and planar structure due to the conjugated carbonyl groups.

### Similar Molecules in the Training Data:
1. **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (Property: -789.57429137): This is a similar cyclic imide with additional alkyl substitutions. The presence of the imide and alkyl groups seems to correlate with a negative property value.
2. **O=C1CCCN1** (Property: -1671.24277652): A simpler lactam (cyclic amide), which also has a negative property value.
3. **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (Property: -1342.27629533): Another cyclic urea/imide-like structure with negative property values.

### Observations:
- Cyclic imides, lactams, and similar structures with polar C=O and N-H groups tend to have **negative property values** in the training data.
- The rigidity and polarity of these structures may contribute to this trend.
- The molecule in question is simpler than some of the above examples (no bulky alkyl groups), so its property value might be less negative but still in the same range.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to cyclic imides/lactams with negative property values, and considering the simplicity of the molecule (no large substituents), I predict the property for **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2** to be:

**Approximately -1100.0**

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples. For precise predictions, computational methods or a larger training dataset would be needed.)

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 2035.3774713846344
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values tend to increase with the size and complexity of the molecule, particularly with the presence of multiple heavy atoms (like Cl, Br, etc.) and aromatic rings. 

The molecule in question is **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, which is a trichlorinated biphenyl derivative (specifically, 2,2',6-trichlorobiphenyl). It has:
- Two benzene rings, 
- Three chlorine atoms (which contribute significantly to the property value based on the examples), 
- And a relatively rigid, planar structure due to the biphenyl core.

Looking at similar molecules in the examples:
1. **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **447.74472814**.
2. **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a heavily chlorinated biphenyl with 6 Cl atoms) has a property value of **2843.90428258**.

The molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** has 3 Cl atoms, which is intermediate between these two examples. Its structure is more similar to the second example but with fewer Cl atoms. 

Given the trend, I would estimate the property value for this molecule to be roughly **3–4 times** that of dichlorobenzene (since it has 1.5× the Cl atoms and a biphenyl core). A reasonable prediction would be in the range of **1200–1600**. 

A more precise estimate, considering the examples and the additive contributions of the Cl atoms and aromatic rings, would be approximately **1400**. 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**1400.0** (rounded to one decimal place for consistency with the provided examples). 

*Note: If more precise interpolation is needed, a value of* **1420.5** *could also be justified based on the examples, but 1400 is a reasonable approximation.*

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 323.21914665930547
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular weight, polarity, and structural complexity (e.g., presence of functional groups, rings, halogens, etc.). 

The molecule in question is **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1**, which is **diethylbenzene** (specifically, 1,4-diethylbenzene based on the symmetry). This is a relatively simple, non-polar hydrocarbon with no highly polar or charged functional groups. 

Looking at similar molecules in the examples:
- **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (heptylbenzene) has a property value of **1006.05722533**. This is a larger, non-polar hydrocarbon with a benzene ring and a long alkyl chain.
- **Cc1ccccc1N** (methylaniline) has a property value of **-521.21482122**, likely due to the polar -NH2 group.
- **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine) has a property value of **-475.5235117**, likely due to the polar nitrogen in the ring.

Since **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** is non-polar and smaller than heptylbenzene but larger than ethylpyridine, and lacks polar groups, its property value should be positive and moderately high, but not as high as heptylbenzene. 

A reasonable prediction for **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** would be in the range of **800-900**. 

**Predicted property value: 850.0** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. If the property is something else, like logP or a quantum chemical descriptor, the reasoning would differ.)

True Property: -1657.695487989341
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Nitro groups (NO₂)**: Often associated with positive property values (e.g., `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(C)C)N(=O)=O` has a high value of 1309.43). However, some nitro-containing molecules have negative values (e.g., `Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` has -360.97), suggesting other factors dominate.
   - **Sulfonamides (S(=O)(=O)N)**: The given molecule contains this group, which is polar and often contributes to higher property values due to its electronegativity and potential for hydrogen bonding.
   - **Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing/donating groups**: The molecule has an aniline (NH₂) group attached to a benzene ring, which is further substituted with a sulfonamide. Aniline derivatives in the examples show mixed trends (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has -795.05, but `Nc1ncnc2n(ccc12)C3OC(CO)C(O)C3O` has -2541.14).

2. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property: -795.05): This is structurally similar to the target molecule but has a nitro group instead of a sulfonamide. Sulfonamides are generally more polarizable and bulky than nitro groups, which might increase the property value.
   - `Oc1cccc2cccnc12` (property: -272.72): A fused aromatic system with heteroatoms, but less polar than the sulfonamide.
   - `Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12` (property: -1644.76): A purine-like structure with high polarity but very negative property value, suggesting complex interactions.

3. **Sulfonamide-Containing Molecules**:
   - No direct examples of sulfonamides are provided, but sulfonyl groups (S=O) are present in some molecules (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12` with property 1298.01). Sulfonamides are even more polar due to the additional nitrogen.

### Prediction:
The molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** has:
- An aniline group (electron-donating, likely decreasing the property value).
- A sulfonamide group (electron-withdrawing and polar, likely increasing the property value).
- Aromaticity (neutral effect unless substituted with polar groups).

Given the competing effects:
- The sulfonamide is likely dominant, pushing the property to a positive value.
- The closest analog is `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (-795.05), but the sulfonamide should increase this significantly (perhaps by ~1000-1500 units based on other high-value examples).

### Predicted Property:
**Approximately 500 to 800**. A reasonable estimate is **600.0** (specific value: 600.0), balancing the sulfonamide's contribution against the aniline's tendency to lower the value. 

(Note: Without a clear mathematical model or more examples of sulfonamides, this is an educated guess based on structural similarity and group contributions.) 

**Final Answer**: 600.0

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings. It can be described as follows:
- It has a naphthalene-like core (two fused benzene rings) with two additional benzene rings fused to it, forming a larger conjugated system. 
- The structure is fully aromatic, planar, and highly conjugated, similar to other PAHs in the dataset (e.g., **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12**, **c1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32**, etc.).

### Comparison to Examples:
From the given examples, we observe that:
1. **c1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32** (a 3-ring PAH, phenanthrene-like) has a property value of **1342.70050336**.
2. **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (a 4-ring PAH with a methyl group) has a value of **2131.72742954**.
3. **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54** (a 5-ring PAH) has a value of **2258.83931156**.

The molecule in question is a 4-ring PAH (similar to pyrene or chrysene but with a slightly different arrangement). Given the trend:
- Larger, more conjugated systems have higher property values.
- The absence of substituents (like Cl, Br, or methyl groups) reduces the value compared to halogenated or alkylated PAHs but keeps it higher than smaller PAHs.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- A 3-ring PAH (phenanthrene-like) is ~1342.
- A 4-ring PAH (with a methyl) is ~2131.
- A 5-ring PAH is ~2258.

The 4-ring PAH here (without substituents) should lie between the 3-ring and 5-ring examples. A reasonable estimate is slightly lower than the methylated 4-ring PAH but higher than the 3-ring PAH. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** is approximately **1800–2000**. 

Looking at the examples, the closest match is **c1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32** (1342) and **c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12** (2131). Since this molecule is intermediate in size, a good estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1900.0** (rounded to a reasonable precision based on the trend). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends.)

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: -84.49950171978021
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and hydrogen bonding. The molecule in question is:

**Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**

This molecule has the following features:
1. Multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH), which contribute to hydrogen bonding and polarity.
2. A carbonyl group (C=O), which adds polarity and potential for conjugation.
3. Aromatic rings (benzene-like structures), which contribute to stability and conjugation.
4. Ether linkages (C-O-C), which add flexibility and moderate polarity.

Comparing this to similar molecules in the dataset:
- Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings (e.g., `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl` with a value of 1182.71934148) tend to have high positive values.
- The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and conjugated systems (as in `OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5` with a value of 3314.77519014) suggests even higher values due to increased conjugation and hydrogen bonding.

Given these observations, the molecule `Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3` is highly conjugated, has multiple hydroxyl groups, and contains a carbonyl group, all of which suggest a high positive property value. 

**Predicted property value: ~2500.0** (This is an estimate based on the trend observed in the dataset, where similar complex, polar, and conjugated molecules have high positive values.) 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molecular polarizability, heat of formation, or another quantum-chemical property—this is a rough interpolation based on the given examples.)

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: -751.9429343322957
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-Containing Groups (P=O, P=S, etc.)**:
   - Molecules with phosphorus groups (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`) tend to have high positive property values (e.g., 1507.92).
   - The presence of `P=O` or `P=S` with additional electronegative atoms (O, S, Cl) increases the property value significantly.

2. **Chlorine Atoms**:
   - Chlorine substitutions (especially multiple Cl atoms) correlate with very high property values (e.g., 1559.44, 1919.68, 3376.56, 5164.80).

3. **Sulfur Atoms**:
   - Sulfur-containing molecules (e.g., `Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1`) tend to have negative or moderately positive values, but when combined with phosphorus, the values are higher (e.g., `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` has 1272.15).

4. **Amide or Carbamate Groups (NC=O)**:
   - The `NC(=O)` group (as in `NC(=O)c1cccnc1`) tends to reduce the property value (e.g., -1476.86), but when combined with phosphorus, the effect is less pronounced.

5. **Ether or Ester Linkages (COC, COO)**:
   - These groups alone do not dominate the property value but contribute contextually.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**
- **Phosphorus Group**: `P(=O)` is present, which is a strong contributor to high property values (similar to `P(=S)` in other examples).
- **Amide Group**: `NC(C)=O` is present, which might slightly reduce the property value, but the phosphorus group likely dominates.
- **Sulfur Atom**: `SC` is present, which may add to the property value when combined with phosphorus.
- **Ether Linkage**: `COP` is present, which is neutral or slightly positive.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
1. `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **1507.92**. This has `P=S`, multiple Cl atoms, and an ether linkage.
   - Our molecule lacks Cl but has `P=O` and `SC`, which are somewhat similar in contribution.
2. `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` has a value of **1272.15**. This has `P=S`, `SC`, and an amide group.
   - Our molecule is smaller but has similar features (`P=O` instead of `P=S`).

### Adjustments:
- `P=O` is slightly less polarizable than `P=S`, so the value might be slightly lower than 1272.15.
- The absence of Cl reduces the value compared to 1507.92.
- The `NC(C)=O` group may slightly reduce the value, but the `SC` and `P=O` dominate.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** is likely in the range of **1000 to 1300**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 1180.0** (approximate, based on analogous examples). 

(Note: Without a clear mathematical model or more explicit trends, this is an educated guess based on structural similarities.)

Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -276.2825813315571
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and halogen (especially chlorine) content. The molecule in question is **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene). 

From the examples:
- Simple halogenated alkenes or small molecules with halogens tend to have moderate property values (e.g., **CCBr** has -641.64884788, **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has 3376.55903633 due to many Cl atoms).
- The presence of two chlorine atoms on a small alkene (C=C) suggests a property value in the range of small halogenated molecules but not as extreme as highly chlorinated aromatics.

Looking at similar examples:
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (two Cl atoms on a benzene ring) has a value of 246.314337.
- **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (one Cl on benzene) has -285.17726572.
- **CCBr** (one Br on ethane) has -641.64884788.

Since **Cl\C=C/Cl** is a small molecule with two chlorines but no aromaticity or additional functional groups, I estimate its property value to be in the lower-mid range, similar to small halogenated aliphatics. 

**Predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl: ~200 to 400**. 

A reasonable guess would be **~300**, but given the variability in the examples, I'll refine this to:  
**Predicted value: 320.0** (assuming additive effects of the two Cl atoms and the C=C bond). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an approximate interpolation based on the given examples.)
==================================================
Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -860.3212426109452
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have negative or moderately positive property values. For example:
     - **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline): -417.84490446
     - **Cc1cccc2c1Cc3ccccc32** (methyl-substituted polyaromatic): 839.67189069
   - Heteroaromatic rings (containing N, O, etc.) often have more negative values, especially if polar or electronegative atoms are present.

2. **Heteroatom Effects**:
   - Nitrogen in aromatic rings (e.g., pyridine-like structures) tends to reduce the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons. For example:
     - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (complex N-containing polyaromatic): 303.7876823
     - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12** (N-rich heterocycle): -1102.10613263

3. **Simple Pyridine (c1ccncc1)**:
   - Pyridine is a 6-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen. It is less "hydrocarbon-like" than benzene, and the electronegative nitrogen likely pulls the property value downward.
   - Comparing to similar-sized molecules:
     - **CNc1ccccc1** (benzene derivative): -417.84490446
     - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23**: 303.7876823 (but this is a larger, fused system).
   - Pyridine is simpler and smaller, so its value should be more negative than large fused systems but comparable to other N-containing aromatics.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Given the nitrogen's effect and the simplicity of pyridine, the property value is likely negative and in the range of **-200 to -500** based on the examples.
   - A reasonable estimate is **-300 to -400**, closer to **N-methylaniline (-417.84)** but less negative due to the absence of additional substituents.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **c1ccncc1** (pyridine) is:  
**-350.0** (approximate, based on trends in the data).  

*Note: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., heat of formation, polarizability, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.*

Iteration: 59
SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 549.2809715031548
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correspond to **molecular polarizability** (in units of \( \text{Å}^3 \)), which is a measure of how easily the electron cloud of a molecule can be distorted by an external electric field. The values are influenced by:

1. **Molecular size and conjugation**: Larger molecules and those with extended conjugation (e.g., aromatic systems) tend to have higher polarizability.
2. **Functional groups**: Polar or polarizable groups (e.g., halogens, nitro groups, carbonyls) increase polarizability.
3. **Electron-rich regions**: Heteroatoms (O, N, S) and π-systems contribute significantly.
4. **Symmetry and branching**: More symmetric or branched molecules may have slightly lower polarizability compared to linear analogs.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**

This molecule has:
- A **large conjugated system** (benzene + pyridine + another benzene with Cl substitution).
- Multiple **polar groups**: hydroxyl (–OH), ester (–COO–), and amine (–N–) linkages.
- A **chlorine substituent**, which is highly polarizable.
- Significant **flexibility and size**, contributing to higher polarizability.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
1. **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** (678.459): A conjugated bis-aryl urea, similar in size/conjugation but lacks Cl and ester.  
2. **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (414.355): Smaller but with heavy halogens.  
3. **c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54** (2325.070): A large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), showing how size dominates.  

The target molecule is **smaller than PAHs** but **larger than simple aryl halides**, with **more polarizable groups** than most examples. Its structure is most akin to **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** but with additional contributions from Cl, ester, and pyridine.

### Predicted Value:
Given the above, the polarizability should be **between 700–900**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**~850.0** (specific value: **847.326**).  

This accounts for:
- The **core conjugated system** (similar to the bis-urea example, ~678).
- **Additional contributions** from Cl (+~100), ester (+~50), and pyridine (+~20).  

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**847.326**.  

*Note: Without computational tools, this is an approximate extrapolation based on structural trends in the examples.*
==================================================
Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -800.5900158891894
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to follow certain trends based on molecular structure, such as chain length, functional groups, and branching. 

For the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), we can observe the following:
1. It is a linear alcohol with a 5-carbon chain and a hydroxyl (-OH) group.
2. Comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset:
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene) has a property value of **205.33036815**.
   - **CCCCCCCI** (1-iodohexane) has a property value of **720.33259442**.
   - **CCC(C)Cl** (2-chlorobutane) has a property value of **-215.73030682**.
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol) has a property value of **-169.27268604**.

Given that **CCCCCO** is a linear alcohol (similar to **OC1CCCCCCC1** but acyclic), and considering the influence of the hydroxyl group (which tends to lower the property value compared to hydrocarbons), a reasonable estimate would be between **-100 and 200**. 

A plausible prediction for **CCCCCO** is:  
**-50.0**  

*(This is an educated guess based on the trends in the dataset, as no exact match is present. The actual value could vary depending on the specific property being modeled.)*

True Property: -709.7958144461544
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, heteroatoms, and branching. The molecule in question is:

**CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic ring (c2ccccc2)**: Present in many examples, often contributing positively (e.g., +323.2 for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1) or negatively (e.g., -860.3 for c1ccncc1) depending on substituents.
2. **Sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O))**: Likely contributes positively due to its polar nature (e.g., sulfonyl-containing molecules like CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O have a value of +637.7).
3. **Amide (C(=O)N)**: Often reduces the property value (e.g., CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1 has -379.7).
4. **Heterocycle (CCO1)**: Cyclic ethers can contribute negatively or modestly depending on context.
5. **Methyl group (CC1=)**: Small alkyl groups have minor contributions.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2** (two aromatic rings with amino groups): +122.5.
- **O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** (amide + two aromatic rings): -389.6.
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (sulfonyl + aromatic + nitro): +637.7.

This molecule has:
- One aromatic ring.
- An amide group (reducing effect).
- A sulfonyl group (increasing effect).
- A heterocycle (modest effect).

### Prediction:
Given the competing effects of the sulfonyl (positive) and amide (negative) groups, and the presence of an aromatic ring, the property value is likely modestly positive. 

**Predicted property value: ~450.0** (approximate, based on balancing the contributions of the functional groups and comparison to similar molecules). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molecular polarizability, energy, or another descriptor—this is an educated estimate based on the trends in the provided data.)

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: -111.79934073694017
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values appear to correspond to **molecular polarizability** (often reported in units of 10⁻²⁵ cm³ or atomic units), which is influenced by molecular size, conjugation, and the presence of polar or polarizable groups (e.g., nitro, halogens, aromatic systems). 

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**SMILES:** `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C`  
**Structure Features:**
1. **Aromatic system with a nitro group (`c2ccccc2N(=O)=O`)** – Increases polarizability (see examples like `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` with high values).
2. **Two ester groups (`COC(=O)` and `C(=O)OC`)** – Moderate contribution (similar to `CCOC(=O)CC...` examples).
3. **Conjugated system with double bonds and nitrogen** – Enhances polarizability due to delocalization.
4. **Methyl groups (`C(C)`)** – Minor contributions (alkyl groups generally have low polarizability).

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups and aromaticity (e.g., `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` = 553.67, `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` = 3133.80) suggest high polarizability.
- Esters (e.g., `CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC` = 2998.33) also contribute significantly.
- The target molecule is smaller than the largest examples but has multiple polarizable features.

### Prediction:
Given the combined effects of the nitro-aromatic system, two esters, and conjugation, the predicted polarizability is **~1200–1500**.  
**Final estimate:** **1350.0** (mid-range of the expected scale for this size and functionalization).  

*Note: Without a clear linear trend or computational tools, this is an approximate interpolation based on the examples.*

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -2193.8396948526597
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them with the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - Two amide groups (**NC=O**).
   - A cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**).
   - The molecule is a cyclic diamide (imide) with a fused cyclopropane.

2. **Similarity to Given Examples**:
   - The presence of amide/imide groups is seen in molecules like:
     - `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property = 64.65751346)
     - `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` (property = 74.51008694)
     - These have properties in the range of ~60-75.
   - Cyclic structures with polar groups (e.g., `C1CCCCC1` = 1.09473039) tend to have low-moderate values unless heavily substituted.
   - The cyclopropane ring introduces strain but doesn't drastically increase the property in the given examples.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The molecule is small and rigid (no long alkyl chains or large conjugated systems).
   - No halogens or heavy atoms (which increase the property in many examples).
   - The cyclic diamide structure is more polar than simple hydrocarbons but less polar than heavily halogenated or polycyclic aromatic systems.

### Prediction:
Given the small size, lack of heavy atoms/halogens, and moderate polarity, the property value is likely in the **low-positive range**, similar to other small polar cyclic molecules in the examples. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: ~50.0** (specific guess: **52.3412**).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., dipole moment, energy, or another descriptor—this is an approximate inference based on the trend in the data.)  

---
**Final Answer**:  
The predicted property value for **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2** is **52.3412**.

SMILES: ClCC
True Property: -748.4534812248393
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values vary widely based on the molecular structure. The molecule in question is **ClCC** (chloroethane). 

Looking at similar small halogenated alkanes in the examples:
- **CCCCC** (pentane) has a property value of **-97.49942506**.
- **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) has a property value of **0.68420649**.
- **CC#N** (acetonitrile) has a property value of **-1237.81164819**.

**ClCC** is a very simple chloroalkane with only two carbons and one chlorine. Given that:
1. Small halogenated alkanes tend to have moderately negative or near-zero property values in the dataset.
2. The presence of chlorine seems to increase the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons (e.g., pentane is more negative than chlorobenzene).
3. **ClCC** is simpler than chlorobenzene but has a chlorine substituent like some other molecules with positive or near-zero values.

A reasonable estimate for **ClCC** would be slightly negative but closer to zero than larger or more complex halogenated molecules. 

**Predicted property value for ClCC: ~ -50.0**  

*(Note: This is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data. Without a clear quantitative pattern or model, the exact value cannot be precisely determined.)*

SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 836.5792773504072
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values, especially when the chlorines are on aromatic rings or attached to central carbon atoms. For example:
     - **ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C4(Cl)C5(Cl)C1(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl** (many chlorines) has a very high value of **2657.4580136**.
     - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (three chlorines on aromatic rings) has a value of **2035.37747138**.
     - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (multiple chlorines, including CCl3) has a value of **2843.90428258**.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Heteroatoms**:
   - Aromatic rings with nitrogen (e.g., pyridine-like structures) tend to have lower or moderate values unless heavily substituted with halogens. For example:
     - **c2ccc1ocnc1c2** (oxygen and nitrogen in the ring) has a value of **-349.76635854**.
     - **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1** (nitrogen in the ring) has a value of **-1815.81560821**.

3. **Combination of Aromatic Ring and CCl3**:
   - The presence of a **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (trichloromethyl) group significantly increases the property value, especially when attached to an aromatic ring. For example:
     - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has a value of **2843.90428258** (due to two aromatic rings and CCl3).
     - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (no CCl3 but multiple chlorines) has a value of **2035.37747138**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, which consists of:
- A chlorinated pyridine ring (**Clc1ccccn1**).
- A **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (trichloromethyl) group attached to the pyridine ring.

#### Comparison with Similar Examples:
1. The pyridine ring with nitrogen will slightly reduce the property value compared to a pure benzene ring, but the **CCl3** group will significantly increase it.
2. The closest example is **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, which has a benzene ring + CCl3 and a value of **2843.90428258**. Here, the pyridine ring (less favorable than benzene) may reduce the value slightly, but the **CCl3** and additional chlorine on the ring will keep it high.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the strong influence of **CCl3** and the presence of a chlorinated aromatic ring, I predict the value will be slightly lower than **2843.90428258** (due to the pyridine nitrogen) but still very high. 

**Final Prediction: ~2500.0**

However, looking at the examples more carefully:
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (two chlorinated benzene rings, no CCl3) = **2035.37747138**.
- Adding **CCl3** to one ring (as in the target) would likely add ~500-800 to this value, so a reasonable estimate is **2500-2700**.

Given the pyridine nitrogen's slight reduction, I'll refine the prediction to:

**Predicted property value: 2550.0** (approximate, likely between 2500 and 2600). 

For a more precise estimate, I'd place it at **2550.0**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on extrapolating trends from the given data.)

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -534.7757938800023
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might help us estimate the value.

### Observations:
1. **Alcohols (presence of -OH group)**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC**: Property = -267.86684148
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1**: Property = -409.90810915
   - **CCC(C)CCO**: Property = -632.27521894
   - **CCC(CC)CO**: Property = -632.27521894 (same as above, likely due to structural similarity)
   - **CC1CC2C3CC(F)C4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**: Property = -338.88747532 (complex polyol, but still negative)

   Alcohols tend to have negative property values, typically in the range of -200 to -600 for simple structures.

2. **Chain length and branching**:
   - Longer chains or branching can slightly affect the value, but the dominant factor seems to be the presence of functional groups (e.g., -OH).
   - **CCCCC(C)O** is a branched alcohol (2-hexanol), similar to **CCC(C)CCO** (2-pentanol) and **CCC(CC)CO** (3-hexanol), which both have a value of -632.27521894.

3. **Comparison to similar molecules**:
   - **CCCCC(C)O** is structurally very similar to **CCC(C)CCO** and **CCC(CC)CO**, differing only by one carbon in the chain. The property value is likely close to these.

### Prediction:
Given the consistency in the property values for similar alcohols, the predicted property value for **CCCCC(C)O** is approximately:

**-632.27521894**  

This matches the values observed for **CCC(C)CCO** and **CCC(CC)CO**, as the structural differences (minor chain length/branching variations) do not appear to significantly alter the property in the given examples.

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 597.0385846208928
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds**:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene): Property value = **1588.31694974**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl): Property value = **1588.31694974** (same as 1,4-dichlorobenzene, which seems inconsistent; likely a typo or error in the data).
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): Property value not directly given, but related structures suggest halogenated aromatics have positive property values in the hundreds to thousands.

2. **Brominated vs. Chlorinated Analogs**:
   - Bromine is heavier and more polarizable than chlorine, which may increase the property value slightly compared to chlorinated analogs.
   - For example, **ClC(Cl)Cl** (chloroform) = -241.25120896, while **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl** (carbon tetrachloride) = 174.33581407. This suggests adding more halogens can increase the property value.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution**:
   - Symmetrically disubstituted aromatics (e.g., 1,4-dichlorobenzene) tend to have higher property values than monosubstituted or asymmetrical ones.

4. **Brominated Aromatics**:
   - No direct examples of brominated aromatics are given, but comparing **Cl** to **Br**, we can infer that **Br** substitution would increase the property value relative to **Cl** due to its larger size and polarizability.

### Prediction for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 (1,4-dibromobenzene):
- This is the brominated analog of 1,4-dichlorobenzene. Given that bromine is heavier and more polarizable than chlorine, the property value should be **higher** than that of 1,4-dichlorobenzene (1588.31694974).
- The increase is not necessarily linear, but based on the examples, a reasonable estimate would be in the range of **1600 to 1800**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the data and trends, the predicted property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is approximately **1700.0**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molecular polarizability, energy, or another descriptor—this is an educated estimate based on the given examples.)

**Answer:**  
The predicted property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is **1700.0**.

Iteration: 68
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 3376.5590363329197
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values tend to increase with the size and complexity of the molecule, especially when there are multiple halogen atoms (Cl, Br) or aromatic systems present. 

Let's analyze the given molecule: 
**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**

This is a polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure with two benzene rings connected, each heavily substituted with chlorine atoms. Comparing it to the examples:

1. **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (a hexachlorinated biphenyl derivative) has a property value of **5164.80112293**.
   - This molecule has 12 chlorine atoms and two benzene rings.

2. The molecule we are predicting (**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**) has 8 chlorine atoms and two benzene rings. It is less chlorinated than the example above but still heavily substituted.

3. Other smaller chlorinated aromatics (e.g., **ClC(Br)Br**) have much lower property values (e.g., -27.64194226), indicating that the property scales with the number of halogens and aromatic rings.

Given this trend, the property value for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl** should be high but less than the hexachlorinated example (5164.80112293). 

### Predicted property value: **~3500.0** 
(Exact prediction: Given the examples, a reasonable estimate would be between 3000 and 4000, but likely closer to 3500 due to the high degree of chlorination and aromaticity.) 

However, looking more closely at the examples, the property seems to scale nonlinearly with the number of chlorines. The hexachlorinated biphenyl (12 Cl) has a value of ~5164, while the molecule in question (8 Cl) would likely be somewhat lower but still very high. 

A more precise estimate based on the examples would be:  
**~4000.0** (since the reduction from 12 Cl to 8 Cl may not be linear, and the biphenyl scaffold retains significant contributions to the property). 

### Final predicted property value: **4000.0** (approximate, based on the trend in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)

Iteration: 69
SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 2680.5568247585966
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse set of molecules and their corresponding property values, I can attempt to predict the property for the new molecule by identifying structural patterns and functional groups that correlate with the property values in the provided examples. Here's the molecule in question:

**Molecule:**  
`Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1`

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains three aromatic rings (two substituted phenyl rings and one central phenyl ring). Aromatic rings are present in many of the examples, and their contribution to the property seems to vary widely (e.g., `c1ccccc1n2ncc(N)c(Br)c2(=O)` has a value of -521.23, while `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` has a value of 2035.38). The presence of multiple aromatic rings often increases the property value, especially if they are substituted with heavy atoms or polar groups.

2. **Phosphate Group (P=O)**: The `OP(=O)(...)` group is a phosphate ester linkage. This is a polar and bulky group. In the examples, similar polar/charged groups (e.g., `P(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` with a value of 1053.13 and `P(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC` with a value of 979.24) suggest that phosphate/sulfur-phosphate groups contribute positively to the property value, often in the range of ~1000-2000.

3. **Methyl Substitutions**: The molecule has multiple methyl (`C`) substitutions on the aromatic rings. Methyl groups are present in many examples, and their effect seems modest unless combined with other features (e.g., `CC(C)c1ccccc1` has a value of 322.26, while `CCCC` has -364.41). Here, the methyl groups are likely less significant compared to the phosphate and aromatic systems.

4. **Ether Linkages (Oc)**: The `Oc` (aryl ether) linkages are present in examples like `COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (value: 1961.55) and `COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (value: 1961.55). These seem to contribute positively, especially when combined with other heavy atoms or polar groups.

5. **Size and Complexity**: The molecule is large and complex, with multiple rings and a phosphate group. Larger molecules in the examples tend to have higher property values (e.g., `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O` has a value of 1108.48).

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- The closest analog in the examples is likely `COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (value: 1961.55), which has a similar combination of aromatic rings, ether linkages, and polar/heavy atom substitutions (Cl here vs. P=O in the new molecule).
- The phosphate group is more polar/bulky than the `C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` group, but the overall structure is similar in complexity.

### Prediction:
Given the above, the property value for `Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1` is likely in the range of **1800-2200**, considering:
- The phosphate group adds significant value (~1000-1500).
- The three aromatic rings with ether linkages and methyl substitutions add additional value (~500-800).
- No strongly negative contributions (e.g., no highly electronegative or small fragments that would reduce the value).

### Final Predicted Value:
**Predicted property value: 1950.0**  
(This is an estimate based on the structural similarities and trends in the provided data.)

Iteration: 70
SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 804.2163102949784
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and halogen substitutions (especially chlorine and fluorine). The molecule in question is:

**FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**

Breaking it down:
1. It contains a **trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**, which is highly electronegative and often contributes to higher property values (e.g., see molecules with CF3 or multiple halogens like Cl or F).
2. It has **two chlorine atoms (Cl)** in a cyclic structure, which also tends to increase the property value (e.g., Cl-heavy molecules like ClC(Cl)C(...) have high values).
3. The **aromatic ring with nitrogen and carbonyl (C=O)** adds moderate complexity.
4. The **cyclic amide (lactam) structure (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O)** introduces rigidity and polarity.

Comparing to similar molecules:
- The presence of **CF3** and **multiple Cl** is reminiscent of molecules like `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` (property = 2456.30130505) or `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl` (property = 2929.49851468), but with fewer Cl atoms.
- The **lactam + CF3** combination is somewhat unique, but the closest analog might be `CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C` (property = 126.12662467), though this is less halogenated.

Given the **high halogen content (CF3 + 2Cl)** and cyclic structure, I predict a **property value in the range of 1000–1500**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: 1280.0** (approximate, based on structural similarity to high-halogen examples). 

This balances the contributions of the CF3 group, Cl substitutions, and the cyclic amide.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -503.30229526372807
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (methyl 4-nitrobenzoate or a similar nitro-substituted aromatic compound), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Nitro Groups (-NO2):**
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene): Property = **-571.99662703**
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol): Property = **-647.8067063**
   - Nitro groups tend to contribute negatively to the property value, especially when attached to aromatic rings.

2. **Aromatic Rings with Ethers (-OCH3):**
   - **COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC** (dimethyl phthalate): Property = **-738.3956458**
   - Ether substituents (e.g., -OCH3) also contribute negatively.

3. **Combined Substituents (Nitro + Ether):**
   - The molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has both a methoxy (-OCH3) and a nitro (-NO2) group on an aromatic ring. 
   - From the examples, similar structures with nitro or ether groups have property values in the range of **-500 to -800**.

4. **Specific Comparison:**
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (two nitro groups): **-571.99662703**
   - **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (one nitro and one methoxy): Likely less negative than dinitrobenzene but more negative than phenol (**-647.8067063**).

### Prediction:
Given the presence of one nitro group and one methoxy group on the aromatic ring, the property value is expected to be slightly less negative than dinitrobenzene but more negative than phenol. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -600.0**  
(Approximate, based on interpolation of the given examples.)

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property being predicted (e.g., energy, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the trend in the provided data. The value is likely in the range of **-550 to -650**. For precision, I would suggest **-600.0** as a balanced prediction.

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 2287.8496668064877
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values appear to correlate with molecular complexity, halogenation (especially chlorine and bromine), and structural features like rings and branching. The molecule in question is highly chlorinated and has a complex polycyclic structure, which likely contributes to a high property value.

The molecule is:  
**ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Highly chlorinated molecules** tend to have high positive values (e.g., `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` has a value of **893.16315421**).  
2. **Polycyclic structures** with halogens also show high values (e.g., `Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13` has a value of **2342.7503957**).  
3. The presence of **multiple chlorine atoms** and **strained rings** further increases the value.  

### Prediction:
This molecule has **8 chlorine atoms** and a **complex, strained polycyclic structure**, which is even more elaborate than some of the highest-valued examples. Comparing it to similar structures:
- `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (6 Cl) → **893.16**  
- `Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13` (no Cl, but polycyclic) → **2342.75**  
- `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (4 Cl) → **1140.44**  

Given the additional complexity and chlorine count, the predicted value should be **higher than 2342.75** but not excessively so, as the examples don't show values beyond this range for similar-sized molecules.  

### Final Prediction:  
**Property value = 2450.0** (estimated based on the trend).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being calculated, this is an educated guess based on the given data trends.)*

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -1210.7718076382444
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to follow certain trends based on molecular structure, functional groups, and size. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule: CCCOC=O (propyl formate, or propyl methanoate)**  
This is an ester with the structure:  
- A propyl group (CCC) attached to an oxygen (O), which is bonded to a carbonyl (C=O).

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Esters and related compounds**:  
   - `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` has a value of **-611.3385003**. This is an ethyl ester with an aromatic amine substituent.  
   - `CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2` has a value of **865.38437065**. This is a more complex ester with additional aromatic and ether groups.  
   - `c1ccccc1(OC(=O)NC)` has a value of **-639.18570451**. This is a phenyl ester with a carbamoyl group.  

2. **Simple aliphatic esters**:  
   The simplest ester in the examples is `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` with **-611.3385003**. Propyl formate (CCCOC=O) is even simpler, with no aromatic or additional functional groups.  

3. **Trends for small aliphatic molecules**:  
   - `CCC#C` (1-butyne) has **-895.89998018**.  
   - `CC#N` (acetonitrile) has **-1237.81164819**.  
   - `CCCI` (iodoethane) has **-347.30321517**.  
   - `CC(Cl)Cl` (1,1-dichloroethane) has **-361.94523409**.  

   These suggest that small aliphatic molecules with polar or functional groups tend to have negative values, with more polar groups (like nitriles or halogens) giving more negative values.  

4. **Ester contribution**:  
   Esters seem to have moderately negative values (around **-600 to -200** for simple ones). Propyl formate is simpler than the examples, so its value might be less negative than `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (-611.3385003) but more negative than very small non-polar molecules like `CCC#C` (-895.89998018).  

### Prediction:  
Given the simplicity of propyl formate (no aromaticity, no additional functional groups), and comparing to similar-sized esters/aliphatics, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -500.0**  

This is a rough interpolation based on the examples, as no exact match is present. The actual value could vary, but this is a plausible estimate given the data.  

**Final answer: -500.0**

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 924.4998115284798
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and molecular weight, though the exact nature of the property (e.g., boiling point, solubility, etc.) isn't explicitly stated. 

The molecule in question is **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, which is **ethyl decanoate** (a fatty acid ester with a 10-carbon chain and an ethyl ester group). 

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Long hydrocarbon chains** (e.g., CCCCCCc1ccccc1 → 1006.057) tend to have higher positive values.
2. **Ester groups** (e.g., COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C → -338.449) can reduce the value, but the effect depends on the rest of the structure.
3. The presence of **oxygenated functional groups** (e.g., alcohols, ethers) can lead to negative values (e.g., CCOC → -886.868).

### Prediction for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC:
- The molecule has a long hydrocarbon chain (10 carbons) and an ester group (COO). 
- Compared to **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (1006.057), which has a 6-carbon chain + benzene, this molecule has a longer chain but no aromaticity. 
- The ester group may slightly reduce the value compared to a pure hydrocarbon, but the long chain dominates.

### Estimated value:
Given the trends, I predict a **positive value around 800–1200**. A reasonable guess would be:  
**950.0** (since it's less than CCCCCCc1ccccc1 but still large due to the long chain).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property, this is an educated guess based on the examples.)*

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1040.3359705662015
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol-like core (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)**: Similar to **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 6.56838232), but with additional substitutions.
2. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: Present in molecules like **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property = 1290.96080846).
3. **Chlorinated aromatic rings (Cl substitutions)**: Multiple Cl substitutions increase the property value (e.g., **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** = 949.54176912).
4. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Present in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = -62.12594944), but here it is part of a more complex system.

### Key Observations:
- The molecule combines a phenol, amide, and nitro group with multiple Cl substitutions.
- The presence of **C(=O)N** linking two aromatic rings (one with Cl and one with NO2) suggests a higher property value, similar to the amide-containing example (1290.96080846).
- The nitro group alone tends to lower the value, but in this context, it is likely offset by the rest of the structure.
- Multiple Cl substitutions (like in **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**) contribute to higher values.

### Estimated Property:
Given the complexity and the contributions from the amide, phenol, and multiple Cl substitutions, the property value is likely in the range of **1200–1400**. 

Comparing to similar structures:
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (1290.96080846) is structurally similar but lacks the nitro group.
- The nitro group here may slightly reduce the value, but the additional Cl substitution compensates.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: ~1300.0**  
(Approximate range: 1280–1320 based on structural analogs.)  

For precision, I would predict:  
**1305.0** (close to the amide-containing example but adjusted for the nitro group).  

Let me know if you'd like further refinement!

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 2251.7235640469403
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogens (especially chlorine), and heteroatoms (e.g., sulfur, phosphorus, nitrogen, oxygen). The property tends to increase with more aromatic rings, heavier atoms (e.g., Cl, S, P), and larger molecular size, while polar or charged groups (e.g., carbonyls, nitro groups) may decrease or increase the value contextually.

The molecule to predict is:  
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Features**:  
   - Two aromatic rings (phenyl groups) linked by a sulfur (thioether bridge).  
   - Each ring is substituted with a **P(=S)(OC)OC** group (phosphorodithioate ester).  
   - The molecule is symmetric, with identical substituents on both rings.  

2. **Key Contributors to Property Value**:  
   - **Aromaticity**: Two benzene rings contribute significantly (compare to biphenyl-like structures in the examples, e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` with high value).  
   - **Phosphorodithioate Groups (P(=S)(OC)OC)**: These are heavy, polarizable, and contain sulfur/phosphorus, which likely increase the property (similar to `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` with value **1363.555**).  
   - **Thioether Bridge (S)**: Sulfur linkages tend to raise the value (e.g., `CCSSCC` has **46.936**, but here it’s part of a larger conjugated system).  

3. **Comparable Examples**:  
   - `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` (3376.559): Highly chlorinated biphenyl, very high value.  
   - `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (1363.555): Contains P(=S)(OC) and aromatic Cl.  
   - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` (2482.437): Biphenyl with Cl substituents.  

### Prediction:  
The given molecule is less chlorinated but has two **P(=S)(OC)OC** groups and a thioether bridge, which are heavy and polarizable. It is structurally similar to the **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** example but with higher symmetry and no Cl. The absence of Cl reduces the value compared to chlorinated biphenyls, but the phosphorus/sulfur groups compensate.  

**Estimated Property Value**:  
Given the symmetry and contributions from P/S/O, the value should be between **1500 and 2500**. A reasonable prediction is:

### Final Answer:

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -710.6168622361442
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitrophenol-like structures**: The molecule is a nitrophenol derivative (phenol with a nitro group). 
   - Example: **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (methyl nitrophenyl) has a property value of **-298.16350493**.
   - The presence of the nitro group (**N(=O)=O**) tends to lower the property value (negative contribution).

2. **Phenol derivatives**: 
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (hydroxybenzamide) has a value of **-1264.34517594**, but this includes an amide group, which is not present here.
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** (trichlorophenol) has a value of **693.37485865**, but the halogens add significant positive contributions.

3. **Substituent effects**:
   - The nitro group is electron-withdrawing and likely reduces the property value.
   - The hydroxyl group (**OH**) may slightly increase the value compared to pure hydrocarbons but is overshadowed by the nitro group's effect.

4. **Similar molecules**:
   - **Clc1cccc(Br)c1** (halogenated benzene) has a value of **522.39165638**, but halogens are more polarizable than nitro groups.
   - **Nc1cccc(Cl)c1** (chloroaniline) has a value of **-285.17726572**, which is somewhat close to the nitrophenyl example.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- The nitro group alone (as in **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**) gives a value of **-298.16350493**,
- The hydroxyl group may slightly offset this (but not enough to make it positive),
- No other large contributions are present,

the property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is likely slightly less negative than **-298.16350493** due to the hydroxyl group's minor positive influence. 

### Final Prediction:
**-250.0** (approximate, based on the trend of nitro-aromatics and hydroxyl substitution). 

(Note: Without a more specific property definition or additional similar examples, this is an educated estimate.)

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -6780.76001492882
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and molecular weight. The molecule in question is a complex carbohydrate (a sugar derivative) with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and ether linkages. 

From the examples:
- Molecules with many -OH groups (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`) have highly negative property values (-3367.1854074), likely due to strong hydrogen bonding and polarity.
- The presence of multiple -OH groups and ether linkages in a large, branched structure further increases the magnitude of the negative value.

The given molecule, `OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O`, is even larger and more highly functionalized with -OH groups than `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`. It is a branched oligosaccharide or polysaccharide derivative, which would exhibit very strong hydrogen bonding and high polarity.

Given this trend, the predicted property value for this molecule would be **more negative** than -3367.1854074. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **-4000 to -5000**, but since the examples do not include larger sugars, I will extrapolate based on the trend:

Predicted property value: **-4500.0** (approximate, given the lack of direct examples of similar size). 

However, if we assume the property scales roughly linearly with the number of -OH groups and size, and the given `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (6 -OH groups) has a value of -3367.1854074, the new molecule has significantly more -OH groups (at least 10 -OH groups) and a larger structure. Scaling proportionally:

Predicted property value: **~ -5000.0** (conservative estimate).

For a more precise guess, splitting the difference: **-4500.0**. 

Final predicted property value: **-4500.0**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -895.8999801771685
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as branching, unsaturation (double/triple bonds), and presence of heteroatoms (O, N, S, halogens, etc.). 

The molecule in question is **CCC#C** (1-butyne), which is a simple linear alkyne with a triple bond. Comparing it to similar small hydrocarbons in the dataset:

1. **CCCC(=O)C** (a ketone with 5 carbons) has a property value of **-659.23295471**.
2. **CCCC(O)CCC** (an alcohol with 7 carbons) has a property value of **-267.86684148**.
3. **CCCCCC=O** (an aldehyde with 6 carbons) has a property value of **-392.32400232**.
4. **CC#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (a more complex alkyne + nitrile) has a property value of **-621.97106918**.

Since **CCC#C** is a simpler alkyne with no heteroatoms or additional functional groups, its property value is likely less negative (or more positive) than the examples above but still influenced by the presence of the triple bond. 

From the trend, small hydrocarbons with unsaturation (double/triple bonds) tend to have moderately negative property values unless they are very large or have aromatic systems (which can lead to positive values). 

### Predicted property value for **CCC#C**:  
**-450.0** (estimated based on the trend and simplicity of the molecule). 

This is an approximate prediction given the limited examples of small alkynes in the dataset. For a more precise value, additional similar examples or a clearer pattern would be needed.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 2088.5403157864725
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and halogen (especially chlorine) content. The molecule in question is:

**CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**

Breaking it down:
1. It contains a **phosphorothioate group (P=S)**, which is present in some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** with a value of **1363.55511723**).
2. It has **three chlorine atoms** on the aromatic ring, similar to some high-valued examples (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** with a value of **3376.55903633**).
3. The **ethoxy (CCO)** and **ethyl (CC)** substituents are less impactful than halogens but add some complexity.

Comparing to similar structures:
- The presence of **P=S** and **multiple Cl atoms** suggests a high value, but not as extreme as the heavily chlorinated examples (e.g., hexachlorobenzene derivatives).
- The molecule is somewhat analogous to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 (1363.55511723)**, but with fewer heavy atoms and no amide group.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** is likely in the range of **1200–1500**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1280.42187500**  

This aligns with the trend of high values for phosphorothioates and polychlorinated aromatics while accounting for slightly lower complexity than the highest examples.

Iteration: 81
SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -1815.8156082115372
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, I will attempt to predict the property for the molecule `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1` by analyzing structural patterns and their corresponding property values in the dataset.

### Observations from the dataset:
1. **Aromatic rings with simple substituents** (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1Cl`, `Clc1ccccc1Cl`) tend to have property values in the range of -285 to 447, with higher values for more substituted or halogenated systems.
2. **Heteroaromatic rings** (e.g., `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23`, `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2`) show a wide range, from -2128 (for highly polar/charged systems) to +303 (for neutral fused heterocycles).
3. **Carbonyl groups (C=O)** often increase the property value when part of an amide or ester (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` has a high value of 511), but not always (e.g., `COc1ccc(C=O)cc1` has a negative value).
4. **Hydrazine-like groups (NN)** are not explicitly present in the dataset, but `N(=O)=O` (nitro) groups are associated with negative values (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` is -795).

### Analysis of `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`:
- The molecule is a **pyridine ring (`c1nccc...c1`)** with a **C(=O)NN substituent** (a carbonyl attached to a hydrazine group).
- Pyridine rings in the dataset (e.g., `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23`) have positive values (e.g., +303), but substituents can significantly modulate this.
- The `C(=O)NN` group is somewhat analogous to amides or nitro groups, which can lead to negative or positive values depending on context. Here, it is likely electron-withdrawing and polar, similar to nitro groups, which could reduce the property value.

### Comparison to closest examples:
- `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` (a polar, hydrogen-bonded heterocycle with C=O and NH) has a very negative value (-2128), but this is an extreme case.
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (an amide with aromatic substitution) has a positive value (+511).
- The `C(=O)NN` group here is less stabilizing than an amide but more polar than simple alkyl groups.

### Prediction:
Given the pyridine ring's moderate positive contribution and the `C(=O)NN` group's likely negative contribution (but not as extreme as `N(=O)=O`), I predict a **moderately negative value**. 

A reasonable estimate, considering the examples, is:  
**Predicted property value: -450.0**  

This balances the pyridine's positive effect and the `C(=O)NN` group's negative effect, falling between values like `COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1` (-559) and `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (+56).

Iteration: 82
SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 1272.1451299399816
Predicted Property:
Given the diverse range of property values for the provided molecules, it's clear that the property in question is highly sensitive to molecular structure, functional groups, and possibly molecular weight or complexity. The molecule to predict is:

**CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Complexity**:
   - The molecule contains a **thiophosphate group (P(=S))**, which is relatively rare in the examples but appears in `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1` (property = 314.95393224). This suggests that P(=S) contributes positively to the property.
   - It also has **two thioether linkages (SCC)**, which are not directly present in the examples but sulfur-containing molecules like `CCS` (property = -959.87328715) and `CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1` (property = 630.42786141) suggest sulfur can contribute variably.
   - The **amide group (C(=O)N)** is present, similar to `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (property = -1443.2651735), but here it's part of a cyclic structure (N1CCCCC1C), which may reduce its negative impact.
   - The molecule is **branched and cyclic**, with a 6-membered ring (N1CCCCC1C), similar to `CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO` (property = 224.21446732), suggesting cyclic structures can contribute positively.

2. **Molecular Weight and Size**:
   - The molecule is large (C13H26NO3PS2, MW ~ 339 g/mol), and larger molecules in the examples tend to have higher property values (e.g., `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c2Cl` with MW ~ 356 has property = 2929.49851468). However, the relationship isn't purely linear, as some large molecules have negative values.

3. **Comparison to Closest Examples**:
   - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1` (property = 314.95393224) is the closest in terms of P(=S) and aromaticity, but our molecule lacks aromaticity and has additional complexity.
   - `CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1` (property = 630.42786141) shares the C(=O)S and aromaticity, but our molecule is more complex.
   - The cyclic amide and thiophosphate suggest a higher value than simple sulfur-containing molecules but lower than highly halogenated or aromatic systems.

4. **Prediction**:
   - The presence of P(=S) and cyclic amide suggests a positive contribution, but the lack of halogens or extensive conjugation limits the value. Given the size and functional groups, a reasonable estimate is between 500 and 1000.
   - A weighted guess based on the closest examples is **~650**.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**650.0** (rounded to one decimal place for consistency with the examples). 

This is an educated estimate based on the structural features and trends in the provided data. For a precise prediction, a model trained on these examples would be necessary.
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 703.2274321262372
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with the molecular structure, particularly with the size, functional groups, and degree of branching or saturation. 

For the molecule `CCCCCCCC` (octane), which is a straight-chain alkane with no functional groups or branching, we can compare it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. `C/C1CCCCC1\C` (a cyclohexane derivative with a methyl group) has a property value of **337.72432428**.
2. `CCCCCCCO` (heptanol) has a property value of **-266.7721111**.
3. `CCCC/C=C/C` (a branched alkene) has a property value of **283.0562256**.
4. `CCCCCC1CCCC1` (a cyclic structure with a long alkyl chain) has a property value of **970.13638452**.

Straight-chain alkanes like octane (`CCCCCCCC`) are nonpolar and lack functional groups, which typically results in lower (or more negative) property values compared to cyclic or branched structures. For example:
- `CCCCCCCO` (heptanol) has a hydroxyl group, which introduces polarity, yet its value is negative (-266.77).
- `CCCC/C=C/C` (branched alkene) has a double bond, increasing its value to 283.05.

Since octane is a simple, saturated, linear hydrocarbon, its property value should be lower than branched or cyclic analogs but higher than highly polar or functionalized molecules. 

From the examples, the closest analog is `CCCCCCCO` (heptanol) with a value of -266.77. Octane, being less polar but larger, would likely have a slightly higher (less negative) value. 

### Predicted property value for `CCCCCCCC`: **~50.0** (estimated based on trends in the data). 

However, looking more closely, the trend for linear alkanes seems to be positive but small (e.g., `CCCC/C=C/C` is 283.05, but it has a double bond). Since octane is fully saturated and linear, a reasonable estimate would be between **200 and 300**. 

Given the lack of exact analogs in the data, a conservative estimate is:  
**Predicted property value for `CCCCCCCC`: 250.0** (approximate, based on structural trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 183.64102236104512
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, double bonds, carbonyl groups, halogens, and other substituents. The property values range widely, with highly oxygenated or complex cyclic structures often having large negative values, while simpler or halogenated structures tend to have positive values.

Let's analyze the target molecule:  
**CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**

### Key features:
1. **Multiple rings (steroid-like framework)**: This suggests a high baseline value, as seen in similar cyclic structures (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` has a value of **1053.81483845**).
2. **Carbonyl group (C=O)**: This often increases the value (e.g., `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` has **1025.89921359**).
3. **Hydroxyl groups (-OH)**: These can slightly reduce or stabilize the value (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` has **1053.81483845**).
4. **Alkyne (C#C)**: This is a less common feature, but similar to double bonds, it may contribute positively (e.g., `C=C` has **-1051.48853638**, but this is a very simple molecule; here it’s part of a complex system).
5. **Overall complexity**: The molecule is highly fused and polycyclic, similar to steroids or terpenes, which tend to have large positive values in the dataset.

### Comparison to similar molecules:
- `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` → **1053.81483845**  
  (Similar but lacks the alkyne and has one less hydroxyl group.)
- `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` → **1025.89921359**  
  (Similar but with an additional carbonyl and no alkyne.)

The target molecule has **two hydroxyl groups and an alkyne**, which likely increases the value compared to these examples. However, the exact impact is hard to quantify without a regression model, but we can interpolate.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to the first example (**1053.81483845**) but with additional features (alkyne, extra -OH), the value should be **higher**. A reasonable estimate would be between **1100 and 1200**.  

Given the examples, I predict:  
**1150.0** (rounded to a plausible value within the observed range for such structures).  

(Note: Without a clear mathematical pattern, this is an educated guess based on structural analogs in the dataset.)  

---
**Final answer:**  
**1150.0** (approximate predicted property value).

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -684.480174254804
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the diverse range of property values in the provided examples, predicting the exact property value requires careful consideration of structural features and their apparent contributions to the property in question. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: Large aromatic systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatics like `c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54`) tend to have high positive values (e.g., 2325.07). Smaller aromatics (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) have moderate negative values (e.g., -446.38).
2. **Functional Groups**:
   - Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., hydroxyl `-OH`, ether `-O-`, carbonyl `C=O`) often reduce the property value, especially when multiple are present (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)c1ccccc1` has -1007.49).
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, F, I) tend to increase the value, especially when multiple are present (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has 1341.87).
   - Nitrogen-containing groups (e.g., nitro `NO2`, amides `CONH`) often reduce the value (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has -795.05).
3. **Size and Complexity**: Larger, more complex molecules with mixed functional groups (e.g., `CC(C)C(Nc1ccc(cc1Cl)C(F)(F)F)C(=O)OC(C#N)c2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2`) can have very high values (e.g., 3459.81), but this depends on the balance of increasing/decreasing features.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is highly complex with:
- Multiple aromatic rings (contributing positively).
- Several oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, hydroxyls, carbonyls, and a furan-like `OCO` group), which likely reduce the value.
- No halogens or nitro groups.
- A large, branched structure with multiple rings and functional groups.

Given these features, the molecule is likely to have a **moderate to high positive property value**, but the oxygen-rich environment will temper this. Comparing to similar examples:
- `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` (2168.80) is a large oxygenated polycyclic molecule with a high value.
- `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1` (2251.72) is another large, oxygen/sulfur-containing molecule with a high value.

However, the target molecule has even more oxygenated groups, which may reduce the value somewhat. 

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the above, a reasonable estimate is:  
**~1800 to 2200**.  

Given the examples, a specific prediction could be:  
**2087.45** (reflecting the balance of size/complexity vs. oxygen content).  

This is an educated guess based on the trends in the provided data. For a precise prediction, computational tools or a larger training set would be needed.

Iteration: 86
SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -200.74618465249824
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might help us estimate the value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Substituents and Their Effects**:
   - **Phenol (Oc1ccccc1)**: The presence of an -OH group on a benzene ring tends to contribute negatively to the property value. For example:
     - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: -710.61686224
     - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: -710.61686224 (same as above, indicating the -NO2 group's effect is consistent).
   - **Chlorobenzene (Clc1ccccc1)**: The presence of a -Cl group tends to contribute positively. For example:
     - **Clc1ccccc1I**: 414.35545135
     - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl**: 1588.31694974.

2. **Combined Substituents**:
   - When both -OH and -Cl are present on the same benzene ring, their effects seem to partially cancel out or combine additively. For example:
     - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: 3823.61955798 (highly chlorinated, very positive).
     - **Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I**: 91.7384064 (mixed substituents with -OH, -I, and -C#N).

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: -710.61686224 (phenol with -NO2).
   - **Clc1ccccc1I**: 414.35545135 (chlorobenzene with -I).
   - **Fc1ccccc1**: -351.20319217 (fluorobenzene, slightly less negative than phenol).

### Prediction for Oc1ccccc1Cl:
- The -OH group contributes a large negative value (e.g., -710 for phenol with -NO2).
- The -Cl group contributes a positive value (e.g., +414 for chlorobenzene with -I).
- The net effect is likely a balance between these two substituents. Since -OH is more electronegative and polar than -Cl, the property value will likely be negative but less so than phenol with -NO2.

Given the examples, a reasonable estimate for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is between -300 and -500. A specific value close to **-400** seems plausible, as it balances the -OH and -Cl effects.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**-400.0** (approximate, based on the trend). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data. The actual value could vary depending on the specific property and its dependence on molecular features.)

Iteration: 87
SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 541.6862794457495
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogen Substitution (Cl, Br, F)**:
   - Molecules with multiple halogens (especially Cl) tend to have higher positive property values (e.g., `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a value of **3823.61955798**).
   - Single halogen substitutions (e.g., `Brc1ccccc1`) can still contribute positively but to a lesser extent (**75.33113473**).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Amides (e.g., `NC(=O)`)** often appear in molecules with mid-range values (e.g., `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` has **804.21631029**).
   - **Esters (e.g., `COC(=O)`)** tend to lower the property value (e.g., `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` has **-738.3956458**).
   - **Alcohols (e.g., `CCO`)** are associated with negative values (e.g., `CCO` has **-1334.40792068**).

3. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Aromaticity alone (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) gives a negative value (**-446.37631516**), but substitution with halogens or other groups can significantly alter this.

4. **Alkynes (C#C)**:
   - The presence of a triple bond (`C#C`) is rare in the examples, but it may contribute to a slight increase in the property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

5. **Combination of Features**:
   - The molecule `ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1` has:
     - Two chlorine atoms (one on an aliphatic chain and one on an aromatic ring).
     - An alkyne group (`C#C`).
     - An ester-like linkage (`OC(=O)N`).
     - An aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent.

### Prediction:
Given the above observations:
- The two chlorine atoms will contribute positively (likely in the range of **+500 to +1000** based on similar examples).
- The alkyne group may add a small positive contribution (**+50 to +100**).
- The ester-like linkage (`OC(=O)N`) could reduce the value slightly (e.g., **-200 to -500**).
- The aromatic ring with a single chlorine is somewhat neutral (similar to `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` with **789.71113267**).

Combining these effects, the property value is likely in the **mid-positive range**, similar to molecules like `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (**804.21631029**) or `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (**837.46874579**).

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1** is approximately **750.0**. 

(Note: This is an educated estimate based on the given examples and trends. For precise predictions, computational methods or more extensive data would be required.)

Iteration: 88
SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 1182.7193414802603
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogens (Cl, Br), and heteroatoms (N, O, S). The property values range widely, with highly halogenated or conjugated systems tending to have higher positive values, while highly polar or hydrogen-bonded systems (e.g., multiple OH or carbonyl groups) tend to have more negative values.

Let's analyze the target molecule:  
**OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**  

### Structural features:
1. **Central oxygen (O) attached to a carbon**: Likely an alcohol or ether, contributing polarity.
2. **Two aromatic rings (c1ccc(Cl)cc1 and c3ccccc3Cl)**: Both are chlorinated, with one being a phenyl and the other a chlorophenyl. Aromaticity and chlorine substituents typically increase the property value.
3. **Heterocyclic ring (c2cncnc2)**: A pyrimidine-like structure (nitrogen-containing), which may contribute to conjugation and polarity.
4. **Multiple Cl atoms**: Chlorine substituents generally increase the property value (as seen in examples like Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 = 447.74 and Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl = 2843.90).

### Comparison with similar examples:
- **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1**: 447.74 (dichlorobenzene)
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: 2843.90 (highly chlorinated biphenyl)
- **Nc1nc[nH]n1**: -2019.84 (polar, hydrogen-bonded heterocycle)
- **Oc1ccc(O)cc1**: -849.24 (catechol, highly polar)

The target molecule has:
- Two chlorinated aromatic rings (contributing positively, similar to the dichlorobenzene but more due to two rings).
- A polar central oxygen (contributing negatively, but less than in highly polar cases like catechol).
- A conjugated heterocycle (pyrimidine-like, which may slightly increase the value due to conjugation but not as much as halogens).

### Estimated property value:
Given the balance of:
- Positive contributions from two chlorinated aromatic rings (each ~400-500, so combined ~800-1000).
- Negative contribution from the central oxygen and heterocycle (~-200 to -500).
- Additional conjugation and size (~+500).

A reasonable estimate is **~1200-1500**.  

Looking at similar-sized molecules:
- **CN(C=Nc1ccc(C)cc1C)C=Nc2ccc(C)cc2C**: 1733.01 (conjugated, but no halogens)
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: 2843.90 (highly chlorinated)

The target is less chlorinated than the latter but more polar than the former.  

### Final prediction:
**Predicted property value: 1420.0** (rounded to reasonable precision based on trends).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -943.862855242404
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular structure with the property values. 

### Observations from the given data:
1. **Functional groups and polarity**: 
   - Molecules with polar groups (e.g., nitro groups `N(=O)=O`, carbonyls `C=O`, halogens `Cl`, `Br`) tend to have higher absolute property values, either positive or negative.
   - Nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., `C1CCCCCCC1` with a value of 534.91) have moderate positive values.
   - Ethers (`COC`) and esters (`COC=O`) often have negative values (e.g., `CCOc1ccc(NC(N)=O)cc1` has -522.12, `CC(=O)OCC` has -676.95).

2. **Chain length and branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains tend to increase the property value (e.g., `CCCCBr` has -107.83, while `CCCCCC=O` has -392.32).
   - Branching may reduce the absolute value compared to linear chains.

3. **Aromaticity**:
   - Aromatic rings contribute significantly to the property value, especially with substitutions (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3c2ccc4c5ccccc5ccc43` has 2709.73).

4. **Specific examples similar to CCCCOC=O**:
   - `CC(=O)OCC` (ethyl acetate): -676.95
   - `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl butyrate): -676.95 (same as ethyl acetate, which suggests the aliphatic chain length may not heavily influence the value for esters).
   - `CCCCCC=O` (hexanal): -392.32 (aldehyde with a long chain).

### Prediction for CCCCOC=O:
- The molecule is an ester (`COC=O`) with a butyl chain (`CCCC`). 
- Esters in the data tend to have negative values around -500 to -700.
- The closest analog is `CC(=O)OCC` (ethyl acetate) with -676.95. Extending the chain to butyl (`CCCCOC=O`) might slightly reduce the absolute value (less negative) due to the longer nonpolar tail.

### Estimated property value:
Given the trends, a reasonable prediction for **CCCCOC=O** is **-600 ± 50**. 

### Final answer:
**-600.0** (approximate, based on structural similarity to esters in the dataset).
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -627.7594560963435
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe a trend where simple halogenated hydrocarbons, particularly those with chlorine, tend to have negative property values. For instance:

- `ClCCCl` has a property value of **-598.6806802**.
- `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (hexachlorobenzene) has a positive value (**1788.92629309**), but this is a highly chlorinated aromatic compound, which may behave differently.
- `CCBr` has a value of **-641.64884788**, indicating that simple halogenated alkanes (even with bromine) tend toward negative values.

The molecule `ClCCl` (dichloromethane) is simpler than `ClCCCl` (1,2-dichloroethane) but follows the same trend of being a small, chlorinated alkane. Given that `ClCCCl` has a value of ~-598.68 and `CCBr` (bromoethane) has a value of ~-641.65, we can infer that `ClCCl` would likely have a less negative value than `ClCCCl` because it has fewer atoms and less molecular complexity.

A reasonable estimate for `ClCCl` would be slightly less negative than `ClCCCl`. Given the trend, I predict:

**Predicted property value for ClCCl: ~-550.0**  

(Note: This is an approximate extrapolation based on the given examples. The exact value would depend on the specific property being measured, which is not explicitly defined in the examples.)

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -225.76077398751994
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that might help us estimate the value.

### Observations:
1. **Phenol-like structures**: 
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol) has a value of **-849.23709745**.
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (a methyl-substituted phenol) has a value of **331.85383258**.
   - **c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC** (a dihydroxybenzene with a hexyl chain) has a value of **603.19644305**.

2. **Methyl-substituted aromatics**:
   - **Cc1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** (a trinitrotoluene derivative) has a value of **-423.7838168**.
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (methyl-substituted phenol) has a value of **331.85383258**.

3. **Hydroxy-substituted aromatics**:
   - Phenol derivatives with electron-donating groups (like methyl) tend to have higher (less negative) values compared to those with electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro).

### Target Molecule: **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**
This is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (specifically, 2,4-dimethylphenol). Comparing it to the examples:
- **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (a different methyl-substituted phenol) has a value of **331.85383258**.
- The additional methyl group in **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is likely to slightly increase the value due to increased electron density on the aromatic ring.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (331.85383258) and the additional methyl group, we can estimate a slightly higher value. 

**Predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O: ~350.0**  
(Note: This is an approximate estimate based on the given examples and trends. For precise predictions, computational methods or more data would be needed.)

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 2482.4379930340633
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds** tend to have very large positive property values. For example:
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl**: 2929.49851468
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl**: 3376.55903633
   - **Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl**: 1140.4353803

2. The property value increases with:
   - The number of chlorine atoms (more Cl → higher value).
   - The presence of multiple aromatic rings (more rings → higher value).
   - Symmetry or extended conjugation (e.g., biphenyl-like structures with Cl substitution).

3. The given molecule is a **biphenyl derivative with 5 chlorine atoms**:
   - Structure: Two benzene rings linked directly (biphenyl), with Cl substitutions at positions 2, 4, 5 on the first ring and 2, 4 on the second ring.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl** (6 Cl, biphenyl-like): 2929.49851468
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (7 Cl, biphenyl-like): 3376.55903633

The target molecule has **5 Cl atoms**, which is fewer than the above examples but still heavily chlorinated. The biphenyl core contributes significantly to the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the trends:
- The value for 6 Cl is ~2929, and for 7 Cl is ~3376.
- The value for 5 Cl should be slightly lower than 2929 but still very large (likely between 2500 and 3000).

A reasonable estimate is **~2700**, considering the reduction in Cl count but retention of the biphenyl structure.

### Final Answer:
**2700.0** (approximate, based on interpolation from similar structures)  

*(Note: Without a clear mathematical model or additional data, this is an educated estimate. The true value may vary slightly but should fall in this range.)*

Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -250.76167919270853
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular size, branching, and functional groups. The molecule in question is **CC=C(C)C** (isobutylene or 2-methylpropene), which is a small, branched alkene with 4 carbon atoms.

From the examples:
- Small, branched alkanes like **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (7 carbons) have a value of **772.94807363**.
- Linear alkanes like **CCCCCCCC** (8 carbons) have a value of **703.22743213**.
- Small alkenes like **COC(=O)C=C** (4 carbons with a double bond and ester) have a value of **-1364.03406177**, but this is heavily influenced by the polar ester group.
- **CCCCC(CC)C=O** (7 carbons with a branched aldehyde) has a value of **42.89974703**.

Since **CC=C(C)C** is a small, branched alkene with no polar groups, its value should be positive and relatively low compared to larger alkanes but higher than small polar molecules. 

Given the trend, a reasonable estimate for **CC=C(C)C** would be in the range of **400–600**. 

**Predicted property value: ~500.0** (exact value could vary, but this is a plausible estimate based on the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molecular weight, boiling point, or a computed parameter—this is an empirical guess based on the given data.)
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -627.7594560963435
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values vary widely based on the molecular structure, including factors such as the presence of halogens (Cl, F, Br), aromatic rings, functional groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -COO-), and molecular size/complexity. 

For the molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane, CH2Cl2), which is a simple, small molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a single carbon, we can make an educated prediction based on the following trends from the examples:

1. Small molecules with halogens (especially Cl) tend to have positive property values, but the magnitude depends on the number of halogens and the complexity of the molecule. For example:
   - ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl (tetrachloroethylene) has a value of **498.92337372**.
   - Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (hexachlorobenzene derivative) has a very high value of **4270.68007963**.
   - ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl (a complex polychlorinated structure) has a value of **2287.84966681**.

2. Simpler chlorine-containing molecules like **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (trichlorophenol) have a value of **246.314337**, while **Oc1cccc(Cl)c1** (chlorophenol) has a negative value of **-200.74618465**, suggesting that the presence of other functional groups (like -OH) can significantly influence the property.

3. **ClCCl** is even simpler than the above examples, with just two chlorines and no additional functional groups or complexity. Given that:
   - The smallest chlorine-containing molecule in the examples is **ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl** (498.92), but this has four chlorines.
   - The value for **ClCCl** would likely be lower due to fewer chlorines and no additional complexity.

### Predicted Property for ClCCl:
Given the simplicity of **ClCCl** (just two chlorines and no other features), a reasonable estimate would be **approximately 100 to 200**. 

For specificity, I will predict:  
**Predicted property value for ClCCl: 150.0**  

*(This is an interpolation based on the examples, but note that without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess.)*

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 693.374858646358
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe that the property values tend to increase with the presence of halogens (especially chlorine and bromine) and aromatic rings, while oxygen and nitrogen-containing functional groups can either increase or decrease the property value depending on their context.

Let's analyze the molecule in question:  
**Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**  

This is a chlorinated phenol derivative with three chlorine atoms and an oxygen (hydroxyl group) attached to an aromatic ring. Comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset:

1. **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (given in the examples) has a property value of **693.37485865**.  
   - This is a trichlorophenol with a similar structure but slightly different chlorine positions.  

2. **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** (tribromobenzene) has a high property value of **1118.74603451**, indicating halogens significantly increase the property.  

3. **ClCC** (simple chloroethane) has a much lower value (-748.45348122), showing that aliphatic chlorides don't contribute as much as aromatic chlorides.  

The molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is another trichlorophenol isomer, very similar to the one in the dataset (just a positional difference in chlorine substitution). Given the strong influence of aromatic chlorination, we can expect its property value to be close to the provided trichlorophenol example.  

### Predicted Property Value:  
**~700** (likely slightly higher or lower depending on exact substitution effects, but very close to **693.37485865**).  

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**695.0** (a slight adjustment from the given trichlorophenol due to minor positional differences).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based purely on the trend that aromatic chlorination increases the value significantly.)*

True Property: -684.480174254804
Predicted Property:
Given the complexity of the molecule and the diverse range of property values in the provided examples, I will analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples to estimate the property value.

### Structural Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67**

1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - Multiple methoxy groups (`OCH3`), hydroxyl groups (`OH`), and ether linkages (`O`).
   - A ketone (`C=O`) in a cyclic structure.
   - Fused polycyclic aromatic/heterocyclic systems (benzene and furan-like rings).
   - A sugar-like moiety (`OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O`), similar to carbohydrate derivatives in the examples (e.g., `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` with a very negative value of -5293.15826077).
   - Presence of multiple oxygenated groups (ether, alcohol, ketone) suggests significant polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with many oxygenated groups (e.g., sugars, polyols) tend to have highly negative property values (e.g., -5293.15826077 for the sugar derivative).
   - Aromatic systems with fewer polar groups tend to have positive or less negative values (e.g., `c2ccc1nc(ccc1c2)c4ccc3ccccc3n4` has 1444.35990389).
   - The target molecule is heavily oxygenated with sugar-like and aromatic fragments, but the aromaticity is less dominant compared to the oxygen-rich regions.

3. **Estimated Property Value**:
   - The sugar-like part will dominate the property value, pushing it toward highly negative values (like the sugar example at -5293.15826077).
   - However, the presence of aromatic rings and methoxy groups may moderate this slightly.
   - Given the size and complexity (larger than most examples), the value will likely be more negative than smaller sugars but not as extreme as the largest sugar example.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-3500.0**  
*(This is an approximate estimate based on the structural similarity to highly oxygenated, sugar-like molecules in the dataset, which exhibit large negative values. The exact value would require computational validation, but this is a reasonable prediction given the examples.)*

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -1346.1762723373902
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - Molecules with **halogens (Cl, Br)** tend to have higher positive values (e.g., Cl-heavy molecules like `Clc1ccc(cc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` have very high values like 3376.559).
   - **Oxygen-containing groups (OH, CO, OMe)** often lead to negative values (e.g., `CO` has -1868.225, `c1ccccc1O` has -647.806).
   - **Nitrogen-containing groups (NH, N=O, NC=O)** can lead to either positive or negative values depending on context.
   - **Sulfur-containing groups (S, SC=O)** seem to correlate with mid-range positive values (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1` has 630.427).

2. **Aromatic vs. Aliphatic**:
   - Aromatic systems with simple substituents (e.g., `c1ccncc1`) tend to have negative values (-860.321).
   - Complex fused aromatic systems (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24`) have very high positive values (1920.704).

3. **Molecular Size**:
   - Larger molecules (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO`) tend to have higher positive values (2669.226).
   - Smaller molecules (e.g., `CO`) have very negative values.

4. **Specific Cases Similar to the Target Molecule**:
   - The molecule `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` has a structure somewhat similar to the target (contains a `nnc(s)` core with `C(C)(C)C` and `N(C=O)` groups) and has a value of **-898.499**.
   - The molecule `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (a fused nitrogen heterocycle) has a value of **-1514.559**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**
- **Structure**: Contains a thiol (`CS-`), a triazole-like core (`nnc`), a carbonyl (`C=O`), an amine (`NH`), and a bulky tert-butyl group (`C(C)(C)C`).
- **Similarities**:
  - The `nnc` core with `C(C)(C)C` is similar to `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (value = -898.499).
  - The presence of `S` and `C=O` may push the value toward mid-range (not extremely negative or positive).
- **Differences**:
  - No halogens (which would increase the value).
  - The `CS-` group might slightly increase the value compared to pure nitrogen heterocycles.

### Prediction:
Given the similarities to `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (-898.499) but with a less negative influence (no `O` or `N=O`), the value is likely slightly higher (less negative). 

#### Predicted Property Value: **-750.0** (approximate, based on structural trends). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The value is likely in the range of -800 to -700.)

Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -325.47702808177735
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, branching, and presence of heteroatoms (e.g., O, N, S, Cl, Br). 

Let's analyze the molecule in question:  
**CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**  

This is ethyl benzoate, which consists of:
1. An ethyl group (**CCO**-),  
2. An ester functional group (**C(=O)O**-),  
3. A benzene ring (**c1ccccc1**).  

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Aromatic rings with simple substituents**:  
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene alone) is not in the examples, but substituted benzenes appear frequently.  
   - **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenyl ether) has a high positive value (779.92697984), likely due to the two aromatic rings and ether linkage.  
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a negative value (-732.23778737), likely due to the electron-donating NH2 group.  
   - **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene) has a positive value (322.26125757).  

2. **Esters and carbonyl-containing compounds**:  
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate) has a value of -410.04495045.  
   - **CCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl hexanoate) also has -410.04495045, suggesting esters with aliphatic chains have similar values.  
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is an aromatic ester, which may behave differently.  

3. **Combined effects**:  
   - The ester group (**C(=O)O**) tends to reduce the property value (as seen in aliphatic esters).  
   - The benzene ring tends to increase the value (as in toluene or diphenyl ether).  

### Prediction:
For **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, we have:
- A benzene ring (positive contribution, similar to toluene's +322.26125757).  
- An ester group (negative contribution, similar to -410.04495045 for aliphatic esters).  

Since the ester is attached to an aromatic ring, the effect may not be as strongly negative as in aliphatic esters. A reasonable estimate would be between the value of toluene (322.26125757) and the aliphatic ester (-410.04495045).  

Looking at similar molecules:  
- **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (a diketone-substituted aromatic) has -223.80394342.  
- **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is less complex, so its value should be less negative than -223.  

### Final Prediction:
A plausible value for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is **-200.0**.  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples. The actual value may vary depending on the specific property being measured, which is not explicitly stated in the question.)  

**Predicted property value: -200.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 692.8959141021991
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkyl Halides (Bromides and Chlorides)**:
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (Bromonaphthalene): **864.35806091**
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (Hexachlorobiphenyl): **2035.37747138**
   - **CI** (Methyl iodide): **-881.12111996**
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O**: **808.66365249**
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (Decachlorobiphenyl): **5164.80112293**

   Bromides and chlorides with larger or more conjugated structures tend to have higher positive values, while simpler alkyl halides (like methyl iodide) have negative values.

2. **Alkyl Chains**:
   - **CCCCCCCO** (Heptanol): **-266.7721111**
   - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-Heptene): **549.96517799**
   - **CCCC(=O)CCC** (4-Heptanone): **-125.41504992**
   - **CCCCC(=O)CCCC** (5-Nonanone): **408.40285487**

   Longer alkyl chains with polar groups (e.g., alcohols, ketones) have varying values, but simple hydrocarbons like 1-heptene have positive values.

3. **Bromine Substitution**:
   - The presence of bromine in **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** gives a high positive value (**864.35806091**), but in simpler alkyl bromides (like **CCCCCCCBr**), the value is likely lower.

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCBr**:
- This is a simple linear alkyl bromide (1-bromoheptane). Comparing it to similar molecules:
  - **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol) has **-266.7721111**.
  - **CI** (methyl iodide) has **-881.12111996**.
  - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has **864.35806091**.

Given that **CCCCCCCBr** is a simple alkyl bromide with no conjugation or aromaticity, its value should be closer to the alkyl halides with negative values but less extreme than **CI**. 

### Estimated Value:
A reasonable prediction for **CCCCCCCBr** is **-300.0** (interpolating between **CCCCCCCO** and **CI**).

However, looking at the trend for **CCCCCCC=C** (1-heptene: **549.96517799**) and the fact that bromine is more polarizable than a double bond, the value might be slightly positive but lower than **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1**. 

Given the examples, the most plausible prediction is:  
**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr: 450.0** (between 1-heptene and bromonaphthalene).

But revisiting the examples, **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) is **2035.37747138**, while **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O** is **808.66365249**. Simpler halides like **CI** are negative, so **CCCCCCCBr** is likely positive but not as high as conjugated systems.

Final prediction:  
**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr: 200.0** (moderate positive value due to bromine but no conjugation). 

However, given **CCCCCCC=C** is **549.96517799**, and bromine is heavier than a double bond, a better estimate is:  
**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr: 600.0**. 

But to be conservative, averaging with simpler halides:  
**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr: 400.0**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr: 400.0** (based on interpolation of similar molecules). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., molecular energy, polarizability, etc.—this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples.)
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -1868.2258254725507
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property values vary widely based on the molecular structure. Simple molecules with fewer atoms and less complexity tend to have lower absolute property values, while larger or more complex molecules (e.g., with aromatic rings, multiple functional groups, or halogens) can have very high or very low values.

The molecule in question is **CO (carbon monoxide)**, which is a very small and simple diatomic molecule. Comparing it to the examples:

- **CCC (propane)**: -631.31732985  
- **CCBr (bromomethane)**: -641.64884788  
- **CN2C(=O)CN=C(c1ccccc1)c3cc(ccc23)N(=O)=O (a complex nitroaromatic)**: 47.62077182  

CO is even simpler than propane or bromomethane, with just two atoms and a polar triple bond. Given its simplicity and lack of additional functional groups, we can infer that its property value would likely be:

1. Negative (like most small molecules in the examples).  
2. Less negative than propane or bromomethane because CO has a highly polar bond (C≡O), which may contribute to a less extreme value.  

A reasonable estimate would be between **-500 and -700**, closer to propane but slightly less negative due to the polarity of CO.  

**Predicted property value for CO: -550.0**  

*(This is an educated guess based on the trend in the given data. For precise predictions, computational chemistry methods or empirical models would be required.)*
