SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.8701007040657227
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can identify a pattern in the property values for molecules with similar structural features. 

The molecule in question is `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`, which is a long-chain aliphatic ester (specifically, a methyl ester of a decanoic acid derivative). 

Looking at similar molecules in the examples:
- `CCCCCC(=O)OC` has a property value of `-0.8701007`
- `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is a longer-chain version of the same ester functionality.

Other observations:
1. Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., `CC=C`, `CCCCCC`, `CC(C)C`) have a property value of `0.0`.
2. Esters with longer aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCCC(=O)OC`) tend to have values around `-0.87`.
3. The presence of the ester group (`(=O)OC`) seems to consistently correlate with values near `-0.87` for aliphatic chains.

Since `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is structurally very similar to `CCCCCC(=O)OC` (just with a longer chain), and the chain length doesn't seem to significantly alter the property value for esters in the examples, the predicted property value should be very close to `-0.8701007`.

**Predicted property value: -0.8701007**

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.38190890970572583
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns in the property values:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Property = 0.0**: 
   - Molecules with halogen (Cl, Br) substitutions on aromatic rings or aliphatic chains, especially when no other functional groups are present (e.g., ClC=C, ClCCBr, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl).
   - Polyhalogenated aromatics or simple halogenated aliphatics tend to have this value.

2. **Property ≈ -0.82 to -0.87**: 
   - Molecules with hydroxyl (-OH) groups, especially on aliphatic chains or aromatic rings (e.g., CCC(O)CC, Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl).
   - Ethers (e.g., CO) or phenols also fall in this range.

3. **Property ≈ 2.1465028**: 
   - Molecules with cyclic ureas or imides (e.g., O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1). These contain multiple carbonyls and nitrogens in a ring.

4. **Other Notable Patterns**:
   - Thiols or thiones (e.g., C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)) have values around -0.86.
   - Nitro groups (e.g., Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O) lead to very high values (~3.65).
   - Aromatic heterocycles (e.g., c1cncnc1) have values around -0.87.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2** has the following features:
1. A **chlorinated aromatic ring** (Clc2ccc...).
2. A **fused heterocyclic ring** with a **lactam-like structure** (oc(=O)[nH]c1). This resembles a cyclic amide (similar to uracil or other heterocyclic carbonyls).

### Comparison with Examples:
- The presence of Cl on an aromatic ring alone would suggest a value of 0.0, but the fused heterocycle with a carbonyl (C=O) and NH group is more significant.
- The closest matches are cyclic ureas/imides (property ≈ 2.1465028), but this molecule is not a urea/imide. It is a **lactam** (cyclic amide), which is structurally similar but less polarizable than ureas.
- The molecule **C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)** (property = -0.8602385) is somewhat analogous (cyclic thioamide), but our target lacks sulfur and has an oxygen instead.

Given the lactam-like structure, the property is likely **not 0.0** but also not as high as 2.1465028 (since it's not a urea/imide). A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.8 and 0.0**, leaning toward the lower end due to the polarizable carbonyl and NH groups.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2** is:  
**-0.8602385**  
(Similar to cyclic amides/thioamides in the examples.)

Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.5133685983205183
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule `CC(C)N(=O)=O`, let's break down the features that seem to influence the property value:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (`N(=O)=O`)**:
   - The presence of a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) is seen in `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` with a high property value of **2.91994533**.
   - Nitro groups are strongly electron-withdrawing and polar, which likely contributes to higher property values in these examples.

2. **Alkyl Groups**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., `CCC(C)CC`, `CCCCCl`) typically have a property value of **0.0** unless paired with other functional groups.
   - In `CC(C)N(=O)=O`, the `CC(C)` is an isopropyl group, which is a simple alkyl substituent.

3. **Other Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with multiple polar/ionic groups (e.g., `NC(=O)NC1NC(=O)NC1=O`) have very high values (**8.65558353**).
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, F) often reduce the property value when combined with aromatic systems (e.g., `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has **-0.82375223**).

### Prediction for `CC(C)N(=O)=O`:
- The molecule consists of an isopropyl group (`CC(C)`) attached to a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`).
- The nitro group is the dominant functional group here, and its presence alone (as seen in `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO`) suggests a high positive property value.
- The isopropyl group is neutral (like other alkyl groups), so it won't significantly reduce the effect of the nitro group.
- The value is likely similar to other nitro-containing molecules in the examples, but slightly lower than `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` because the latter has additional heteroatoms (N, O) in the ring.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for `CC(C)N(=O)=O` is approximately **2.5**. 

However, looking at the closest example (`Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` with **2.91994533**), and considering that `CC(C)N(=O)=O` is simpler (no ring or additional heteroatoms), a reasonable estimate would be slightly lower. 

**Final Prediction: 2.2** (similar to other nitro-containing compounds in the dataset, e.g., `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` has **1.73070513**, but `CC(C)N(=O)=O` is more similar to the higher-value nitro examples). 

For precision, I'll predict: **2.1465028** (matching the value seen in other nitro-containing non-cyclic structures like `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)c1ccccc1`). 

But since `CC(C)N(=O)=O` is even simpler, a more conservative estimate is **2.0**. 

Given the examples, the most likely value is:  
**Predicted Property Value: 2.1465028** (aligning with similar nitro-containing structures in the dataset). 

However, if we consider that `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` is **2.91994533** and `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` is **1.73070513**, `CC(C)N(=O)=O` likely falls between these, around **2.3**. 

But to match the dataset's trend precisely, I'll stick with **2.1465028** (as seen in similar nitro examples). 

**Final Answer: 2.1465028**

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 2.064522077104865
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO**, here's the reasoning for the predicted property value:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Steroids/Ketones with Carbonyl Groups**:  
   - Molecules like **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (a steroid-like structure with ketone groups) have property values around **-0.79278101**.  
   - The presence of **C=O** (carbonyl) and cyclic structures tends to yield moderately negative values (between -0.7 and -0.9).

2. **Impact of Hydroxyl Groups (-OH)**:  
   - The target molecule has **C(=O)CO** (a carboxyl-like group) and **CC(O)** (a hydroxyl group), which are polar and may further lower the property value slightly compared to pure ketones.

3. **Size and Complexity**:  
   - Larger polycyclic structures (e.g., steroids) with functional groups tend to have consistent negative values unless heavily halogenated or nitrated (which this molecule is not).

4. **Comparison with Similar Structures**:  
   - The closest analog in the examples is **CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C** (property = **-0.79278101**).  
   - The target molecule adds **C(=O)CO** and **CC(O)**, which are slightly more polar but not drastically different.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to known examples and the influence of additional polar groups, the predicted value is:  
**-0.82** (approximating to the range seen for similar ketone-rich polycyclics).  

### Exact Prediction:
**-0.79278101** (same as the closest matching example, as the additional -OH and -CH2OH groups likely balance out in polarity effects).  

However, if we account for the slightly increased polarity from the -OH and -CH2OH groups, a more precise adjustment would place it closer to **-0.81**.  

### Final Answer:  
**-0.81** (rounded from the expected range of -0.79 to -0.82).  

*(Note: Without explicit training data or a clear trend for exact functional group contributions, this is an educated estimate based on the given examples.)*

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.40998600741531677
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic rings with halogen substitutions**: 
   - The molecule contains two aromatic rings: one with two fluorine atoms (`Fc1cccc(F)c1`) and another with a chlorine atom (`c2ccc(Cl)cc2`). 
   - From the examples, halogenated aromatic rings (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1`, `Brc1ccc(Br)cc1`, `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1`) typically have a property value of **0.0** unless they also include other functional groups that modify the property.

2. **Amide groups (`C(=O)NC(=O)N`)**: 
   - The central linker contains two amide groups (`C(=O)N`). 
   - Examples with amide-like groups (e.g., `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1`, `NC(=O)c1cccnc1`) have property values ranging from **-0.69642712** to **0.2380168**, depending on the context. 
   - The presence of two amides might slightly lower the property value compared to single amide cases.

3. **Combined features**:
   - The molecule is a hybrid of halogenated aromatics and amide groups. 
   - The examples suggest that halogenated aromatics alone give **0.0**, while amides introduce negative or slightly positive values. 
   - The closest analog in the examples is `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` (property = **-0.69642712**), which has a thioamide linked to an aromatic ring. Here, we have two amides and additional halogen substitutions.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of two amide groups and halogenated aromatic rings, the property value is likely slightly negative but not as extreme as cases with hydroxyl groups (which often give **-0.82375223**). 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.69642712** (similar to `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` or `CNN`). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.69642712**

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.5035575898901236
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I can identify some patterns in the property values:

1. Simple alkanes, alkenes, and halogenated compounds without polar functional groups tend to have a property value of 0.0 (e.g., CCCC#C, Cl\C=C/Cl, C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2).

2. Compounds with oxygen-containing functional groups (especially hydroxyl -OH groups) typically have negative property values around -0.82 to -0.87 (e.g., Cc1ccc(N)cc1: -0.87000208, CCCCCO: -0.82375223, CC(C)CC(C)(C)O: -0.82375223).

3. The molecule CCCOC(C)C is an ether (ethoxypropane) with oxygen functionality but no hydroxyl group. Looking at similar ether compounds in the examples:
   - CCOC(=O)CC: -0.8701007 (this is an ester, not directly comparable)
   - CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC: -0.44143236 (phosphate ester, not directly comparable)
   - The closest simple oxygen-containing compound without -OH is COc1ccccc1O: -0.85753947 (methoxy phenol, which has an -OH)

Given that CCCOC(C)C is an ether without other polar groups, and considering that oxygen-containing compounds generally have negative values but ethers might be less polar than alcohols, I would predict a value slightly less negative than the typical -0.82 to -0.87 range seen for alcohols.

Looking at the most similar simple oxygen-containing compounds without additional polar groups, I would predict a value of approximately -0.76, similar to:
- CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1=O: -0.76293362 (ketone)
- O=Cc2ccc1OCOc1c2: -0.76293362 (ester + ether)

Therefore, my predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is: -0.76293362

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.15596324603883685

Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the given molecule, I will predict the property value for:

**Molecule:**  
`CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O`

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups:**  
   - The molecule contains a **bromine (Br)** substituent, which is present in other molecules with negative property values (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` has a value of `-0.8602385`).  
   - It also has **two carbonyl groups (C=O)** and an **NH group** in a heterocyclic ring, similar to structures like `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (value = `2.1465028`), but with additional electronegative substituents (Br).  

2. **Comparison with Examples:**  
   - Molecules with **halogens (Cl, Br)** and **polar groups (C=O, NH)** often have negative or moderately positive values.  
   - The presence of **Br** and **C=O** suggests a value closer to negative, but the **heterocyclic structure with multiple polar groups** may push it toward a small positive value.  

3. **Closest Matches:**  
   - `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3` (value = `-0.87000208`) has aromaticity and NH but no Br or C=O.  
   - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (value = `-0.8602385`) has Br and C=O but is simpler.  
   - `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (value = `2.1465028`) has multiple C=O and NH but no Br.  

### Predicted Property Value:  
Given the balance between the **electron-withdrawing Br** (pulling toward negative) and the **polar heterocycle with C=O/NH** (pushing toward positive), the value is likely **small and positive**.  

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted Property Value: `0.40`**  

This aligns with similar structures like `Cc3ccnc4N(C1CC1)c2ncccc2C(=O)Nc34` (value = `0.40357356`), which also has a heterocycle with polar groups.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2` (biphenyl), I can predict its property value. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems with No Polar or Functional Groups**: 
   - Molecules like `Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1` (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon), `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` (coronene), and `ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (carbon tetrachloride) have a property value of **0.0**. These are either purely aromatic hydrocarbons or symmetric, non-polar molecules with no functional groups.
   - Similarly, `C1CCc2ccccc2C1` (a cyclohexylbenzene derivative) and `Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C` (a dimethyl-substituted polyaromatic) also have a value of **0.0**.

2. **Biphenyl-Like Structures**:
   - The molecule `Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34` (a carbazole derivative with extended aromaticity) has a value of **-0.87000208**, but this includes an amine group (`N`), which introduces polarity. The pure biphenyl structure without such groups is not present in the examples, but similar purely aromatic systems have **0.0**.

3. **Key Insight**:
   - The molecule `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2` (biphenyl) is a symmetric, non-polar, purely aromatic hydrocarbon with no functional groups or heteroatoms. It is analogous to the other purely aromatic systems in the dataset that have a property value of **0.0**.

### Prediction:
The predicted property value for `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2` (biphenyl) is **0.0**. 

This is consistent with the trend that symmetric, non-polar, purely aromatic hydrocarbons without functional groups or heteroatoms have a property value of **0.0** in the given dataset.
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can identify patterns in the property values associated with different molecular structures. Here are the key observations:

1. **Simple hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, cycloalkanes, aromatics without polar groups)** consistently have a property value of **0.0**. Examples:
   - `C1CCC2CCCCC2C1` (bicyclic hydrocarbon) → 0.0  
   - `CCC1CCCCC1` (alkyl-substituted cyclohexane) → 0.0  
   - `c1ccc2ccccc2c1` (naphthalene) → 0.0  

2. **Polar or functionalized groups** (e.g., -OH, -NH₂, -NO₂, -CO, -SO₃H, halogens) introduce non-zero values, often negative or positive depending on the specific group and context.  

3. **Sulfur-containing compounds**:
   - `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O` (complex thiophosphate) → 0.22758752  
   - `CCCCS` (butyl mercaptan, a simple thiol) is structurally similar to simple hydrocarbons but with a thiol (-SH) group.  

### Prediction for `CCCCS`:
- The molecule is a linear alkane with a terminal thiol group (-SH).  
- Thiols are polar but not as strongly functionalized as groups like -NO₂ or -SO₃H (which give high positive values in the examples).  
- Simple thiols are analogous to alcohols (e.g., `CC(O)C(C)(C)C` → -0.82375223), but sulfur is less electronegative than oxygen, so the effect might be slightly less pronounced.  
- However, none of the examples with simple thiols are provided, so the closest analogy is simple hydrocarbons (0.0) or weakly polar groups (small negative values).  

Given the lack of exact matches, the safest prediction is **0.0**, as the thiol group in this simple context does not appear to significantly perturb the property in the same way as more complex polar groups.  

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for `CCCCS`: 0.0**

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.8237522337520979
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can identify patterns in the property values associated with different molecular structures. Here's my reasoning for predicting the property value for the molecule `CCCC(C)(C)CO`:

1. **Key Observations from Examples**:
   - Molecules with simple aliphatic structures (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)C`, `CCBr`, `CCCC/C=C/C`) typically have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain specific functional groups.
   - The presence of an **alcohol group (-OH)** in aliphatic chains tends to give a property value around **-0.82 to -0.87**. For example:
     - `CCCC(C)(O)CC` → **-0.82375223**
     - `CC(C)CC(C)O` → **-0.82375223**
     - `CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O` → **-0.82375223**
   - The structure `CCCC(C)(C)CO` is similar to these examples, with a branched aliphatic chain and a terminal -OH group.

2. **Prediction**:
   - Since `CCCC(C)(C)CO` is a branched aliphatic alcohol, its property value should align with the other aliphatic alcohols in the dataset. The most likely value is **-0.82375223**, as this is repeated for multiple similar structures.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for `CCCC(C)(C)CO` is **-0.82375223**.

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to be **0.0** for molecules that are purely hydrocarbons (containing only carbon and hydrogen) or halogen-substituted hydrocarbons (e.g., Cl, Br, I) without any polar or functional groups that introduce significant electronic effects (e.g., nitro groups, carbonyls, hydroxyls, etc.).

The molecule in question is:  
**Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**  

This is a methyl-substituted naphthalene (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, PAH), which contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms. There are no polar or electron-withdrawing/donating functional groups present.  

### Observations from the examples:  
- **c1ccccc1** (benzene) → 0.0  
- **Cc1cccc(C)c1C** (trimethylbenzene) → 0.0  
- **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (methyl-substituted naphthalene) → 0.0  
- **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) → 0.0  

All these molecules are either pure hydrocarbons or halogenated hydrocarbons, and their property value is consistently **0.0**.  

### Conclusion:  
The predicted property value for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is:  
**0.0**

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 2.146502799646174
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic imide with two carbonyl groups and two nitrogens. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **2.1465028**.
   - The core is identical, but the substituents differ.

2. **Substituents**:
   - The given molecule has a **C(C)CCC** group and a **CC=C** group attached to the hydantoin core.
   - The example molecule has a **C** (methyl) and **CC=C** (allyl) group attached to the core.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of the **allyl (CC=C)** group is shared between the given molecule and the example with a value of **2.1465028**.
   - The **C(C)CCC** group is a branched alkyl chain (isopentyl-like), which is more hydrophobic/lipophilic than a simple methyl group but not significantly polar or charged.

4. **Comparison to Other Examples**:
   - Molecules with **cyclic imides** (like hydantoins) tend to have higher property values when they have polar or conjugated substituents (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** has **2.1465028**).
   - The **C(C)CCC** group is less polar than some other substituents in the examples but still contributes to lipophilicity.

5. **Prediction**:
   - The given molecule is very similar to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** but with a slightly larger lipophilic substituent (**C(C)CCC** instead of **C**). This may slightly increase the property value due to increased lipophilicity.
   - However, the effect is likely modest because the core dominates the property.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarity to the example with **2.1465028**, and accounting for the slightly larger substituent, the predicted value is:  
**~2.3** (rounded estimate based on structural analogy).

However, looking more carefully, the substituent **C(C)CCC** is not dramatically different from **C** in terms of electronic effects (which likely dominate the property), so the value may be very close to the example. 

Thus, a more precise prediction is:  
**2.1465028** (same as the example, since the substituent change is minor and the core dominates).

### Final Answer:
**2.1465028**
==================================================
Iteration: 13
SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns in the property values:

1. Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCCC, C1CCCC1, CCC=C) and fully halogenated aromatic compounds (e.g., Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl) have a property value of 0.0.

2. Aromatic compounds with simple substituents (e.g., CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3c4ccccc4ccc23) also have a property value of 0.0.

3. The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is a simple aromatic compound with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) substitution. 

Based on the examples:
- Clc1ccc(I)cc1 (halogenated aromatic) has a value of 0.0
- CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 (alkyl-substituted aromatic) has a value of 0.0
- No other electronegative substituents (like -CF3) are present in the examples with 0.0 values, but the pattern suggests simple substituted aromatics tend to have 0.0 unless they contain specific functional groups that modify the property (like -OH, -COOR, etc.).

The -CF3 group, while electronegative, is not among the functional groups that appear to modify the property in the given examples (like -COOR, -OH, -N, etc. which show non-zero values). 

Therefore, the most consistent prediction for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is:

**0.0**

True Property: 8.022799713744119
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular properties such as solubility, hydrophilicity, or a similar descriptor, given the trend where highly polar or hydroxyl-rich molecules (e.g., sugars or polyols) have higher positive values, while less polar or hydrophobic molecules have lower or negative values. 

The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar-like molecule (a hexose derivative, likely a form of glucose or a similar polyol). From the examples:
- **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (a linear polyol, likely sorbitol or a similar compound) has a high value of **10.50188668**.
- Other hydroxyl-rich molecules (e.g., **Cn1cnc2n(C)c(=O)[nH]c(=O)c12**) also have positive but lower values, likely due to less hydrophilicity or additional functional groups.

The molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is cyclic but has five hydroxyl groups, making it very hydrophilic, similar to the linear polyol example. However, cyclization might slightly reduce the property value compared to the linear form due to reduced flexibility and solvent interactions. 

Given this, a reasonable prediction would be slightly lower than the linear polyol but still high. 

**Predicted property value: ~8.5 to 9.5**  
(Exact prediction: **9.2**, interpolating between the linear polyol and other hydroxyl-rich examples.)  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property name, this is an educated guess based on the trend. If the property is, for example, logP or a solubility metric, the value would align with this reasoning.)*  

**Final answer: 9.2**

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 6.130505975571688
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as:

1. **Presence of polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., -OH, -NH, -COOH, -CONH, -SO2NH, etc.)**: These tend to increase the property value significantly (e.g., `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` has a very high value of 10.50188668 due to multiple -OH groups).
2. **Aromatic systems with polar substituents**: These often have moderately negative values (e.g., `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has -0.82375223).
3. **Non-polar or hydrophobic structures (e.g., simple alkanes, halocarbons, unsubstituted aromatics)**: These typically have a value of 0.0 (e.g., `Cc1ccc2cc(C)ccc2c1` or `ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C4(Cl)C5(Cl)C1(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl`).
4. **Carbonyl groups (e.g., ketones, esters)**: These often contribute moderately negative values (e.g., `CCCCC(=O)CCCC` has -0.76293362).
5. **Complex cyclic systems with multiple functional groups**: These can have values that depend on the balance of polar/non-polar features (e.g., `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` has -0.71789063).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
`CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C`

This molecule has:
- Two carbonyl groups (`C=O`): One in an ester (`CC(=O)OCC(=O)...`) and one in a ketone (`=CC(=O)C=CC`).
- Two hydroxyl groups (`-OH`): One on the central carbon (`C3(O)`) and one on the ring (`C(O)CC34C`).
- A complex steroid-like polycyclic structure with some unsaturation (`=CC(=O)C=CC`).

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
1. `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (property = -0.50355759): This is a steroid-like molecule with one carbonyl and no hydroxyl groups.
2. `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` (property = -0.71789063): This has one hydroxyl and one carbonyl group.
3. `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (property = 10.50188668): This has five hydroxyl groups and no carbonyls.

The target molecule has two hydroxyl groups and two carbonyl groups, which is more polar than the first two examples but less polar than the polyol. The ester group (`CC(=O)OCC(=O)`) may also contribute to polarity.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of polar (2 -OH, 2 C=O) and non-polar (steroid backbone) features, the property value is likely similar to or slightly higher than `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` (-0.71789063), but not as high as the polyol. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.50 to -0.60** (closer to the steroid-like structures with mixed polar/non-polar features). 

For specificity, I would predict:  
**-0.55** (intermediate between the two closest examples). 

However, since the examples with similar structures (`CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` and `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C`) have values of -0.50355759 and -0.71789063, respectively, the average of these is ~-0.61. Given the additional hydroxyl group in the target molecule, I'll adjust slightly upward.

Final predicted value:  
**-0.58**

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: -0.7178906313569191
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**, here's the reasoning for the predicted property value:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Hydroxyl Groups (-OH)** and **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)** often contribute negatively to the property value (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` = -0.82375223, `CCCCCC(O)CC` = -0.82375223).
2. **Aromatic systems without polar substituents** typically have a value of **0.0** (e.g., `Brc1ccccc1`, `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1`).
3. **Complex polycyclic structures with -OH and C=O** (e.g., steroid-like frameworks) tend to have values around **-0.6178778** (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` = -0.6178778).
4. The presence of **multiple polar groups** (e.g., -OH + C=O) in a rigid ring system further stabilizes the negative contribution.

### Target Molecule Analysis:
- The molecule is a **steroid-like tetracyclic system** with:
  - One **hydroxyl group (-OH)** on the 4-membered ring.
  - One **carbonyl group (C=O)** on the 2-position of ring A.
  - No aromatic rings or other polar substituents.
- Structurally, it closely resembles the example:  
  `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (property = -0.6178778), which also has -OH and C=O in a polycyclic framework.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to the example above, the predicted property value for **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O** is:  
**-0.6178778**  

This aligns with the observed trend for polycyclic systems with -OH and C=O groups.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.7847493968164099
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH₃-CO-NH-)**: Seen in molecules like `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (property = -0.82420924) and `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` (property = 4.24382766). The presence of an amide group can contribute to polarity and hydrogen bonding.
   - **Nitro group (NO₂)**: Seen in molecules like `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (property = -0.5133686) and `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (property = -0.01515195). Nitro groups are strongly electron-withdrawing and can increase polarity.
   - **Aromatic ring**: The molecule has a benzene ring substituted with an acetamide and a nitro group. Aromatic rings alone (e.g., `CC(C)c1ccccc1`) often have a property value of 0.0 unless paired with polar groups.

2. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (methoxy-nitrobenzene) has a property of -0.01515195. Replacing the methoxy with an acetamide (more polar and H-bonding) would likely increase the absolute value of the property (more negative or positive).
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (nitrobenzene) has a property of -0.5133686. Adding an acetamide group (electron-withdrawing and H-bonding) would likely push the property further negative or toward a higher magnitude.

3. **Polarity and H-Bonding**:
   - The acetamide group is more polar and capable of H-bonding than a methoxy or alkyl group. This suggests the property might be more negative than -0.5133686 (nitrobenzene) but not as extreme as some highly polar or charged structures (e.g., `Oc1ccc(c(O)c1)c3oc2cc(O)cc(O)c2c(=O)c3O` with property = 13.0144815).

4. **Nitro + Amide Combination**:
   - The nitro and amide groups are both electron-withdrawing and polar, but they are not directly conjugated in a way that would create extreme polarity (like in some of the high-value examples). The property is likely in the mid-range of negative values.

### Prediction:
Given the above reasoning, the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is expected to have a property value similar to or slightly more negative than nitrobenzene (-0.5133686) but less negative than some of the highly polar amide-containing examples. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.75** (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity, based on the trend of nitro + polar substituents).

### Exact Value from Trends:
Looking closely at the examples, the closest analog is `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (-0.01515195), but with the more polar acetamide replacing methoxy. The acetamide group in other molecules (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1`) gives ~-0.82, but the nitro group's presence may moderate this. 

A precise interpolation suggests:  
**-0.65** (between nitrobenzene and acetamide-containing examples).

However, given the data, the most consistent prediction is:  
**-0.70** (a balance between the nitro and amide contributions). 

But reviewing `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` (4.24382766), which has a nitro and amide but a more complex structure, our molecule is simpler, so likely less extreme. 

Final prediction:  
**-0.70** (approximate). 

For a specific value aligning with the given examples' precision:  
**-0.698** (but this is speculative; the true value would require fitting a model). 

Given the examples, the best guess is:  
**-0.70** (rounded). 

However, looking back at `COc1ccc(C=O)cc1` (-0.8701007) and `CC(C)OC=O` (-0.8701007), which have carbonyls, our molecule's nitro + amide may align closer to these. Thus, a more accurate prediction might be:  
**-0.87** (same as carbonyl + aromatic examples). 

But nitro is less negative than carbonyl, so perhaps splitting the difference:  
**-0.80**. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest answer based on the closest examples is:  
**-0.87** (same as `COc1ccc(C=O)cc1` and `CC(C)OC=O`, as the amide is akin to a carbonyl in polarity). 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** is:  
**-0.87** (matching the trend for carbonyl/amide + aromatic systems in the data).

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 0.06742528840654444
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)SC)**: This is a relatively complex functional group with sulfur and phosphorus. None of the provided examples contain this exact group, but sulfur-containing groups (e.g., CSSC, thiophene derivatives) often have property values around **0.0** unless paired with strongly polar or charged groups.
2. **Chlorinated benzofuran-like ring (n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12)**: 
   - The presence of a **Cl** substituent on an aromatic ring is seen in many examples (e.g., Clc1cccc2ccccc12, Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1), and these typically have a property value of **0.0** unless combined with other strongly polar groups.
   - The **lactam-like (c(=O)o)** group might introduce some polarity, but similar structures (e.g., Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O) have values close to **-0.777**, while others with carbonyls (e.g., CC(=O)OC) are around **-0.87**.
3. **Ethoxy groups (OCC)**: These are present in molecules like CCO (property = **-0.823**) and CCCCCO (property = **-0.823**), suggesting a moderate negative contribution.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule combines moderately polar groups (P=S, C=O, Cl) with nonpolar alkyl chains (CCOP, OCC). 
- No strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups (like nitro or amino) are present to push the value toward extremes (e.g., > 3.0 or < -1.0).
- The closest analogs are sulfur- or chlorine-containing aromatic systems, which mostly have **0.0** unless paired with additional polar groups.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of moderately polar and nonpolar features, the property value is likely close to **0.0**, similar to other chlorine- or sulfur-containing aromatics in the dataset. 

**Final Prediction: 0.0**

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.8237522337520979
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **Alcohols (-OH group)** generally have a property value of **-0.82375223** when they are simple aliphatic alcohols (e.g., `CCCCCCC(C)O`, `CC(C)CO`, `CCCC(O)CCC`). This suggests that the presence of an -OH group on an aliphatic chain or branched alkane consistently gives this value.

2. **Tertiary alcohols** (like `CC(C)(C)CO`, where the -OH is attached to a carbon with three alkyl substituents) follow the same trend as other aliphatic alcohols in the dataset. For example:
   - `CC(C)CO` (isobutyl alcohol) has a value of **-0.82375223**.
   - `CCCCCCC(C)O` (2-methyl-1-heptanol) also has the same value.

3. No examples in the dataset show a deviation from **-0.82375223** for aliphatic alcohols, regardless of branching.

Thus, for the molecule **`CC(C)(C)CO` (tert-butanol)**, the predicted property value is:
**-0.82375223**

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 2.0439006312955876
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structure of the molecule `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12`, I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset.

### Analysis:
1. The molecule contains a fused heterocyclic system with nitrogen atoms and a carbonyl group (`O=`), similar to some of the provided examples.
2. Examples with similar structural motifs (e.g., `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` and `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1`) have property values of **1.73070513**.
   - These molecules also contain a carbonyl group adjacent to nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring, which seems to correlate with this property value.
3. The molecule `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` is structurally analogous to these examples, with a similar arrangement of nitrogen and carbonyl groups in a fused ring system.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to the examples with property values of **1.73070513**, the predicted property value for `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` is:

**1.73070513**

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.8701007040657227
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (isopropyl formate), I can predict its property value based on structural similarities and trends observed in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Ester Functional Group (-COO-)**: 
   - Molecules with ester groups (e.g., **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC**, **COc1ccccc1OCC(O)COC(N)=O**) tend to have negative property values, often in the range of -0.4 to -0.8. 
   - **CC(C)OC=O** is an ester (formate ester), similar to smaller esters in the dataset.

2. **Small Aliphatic Esters**:
   - **CCOC=C** (ethyl vinyl ether, not an ester but similar size) has a value of **-0.50355759**.
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a steroid ester) has **-0.50355759**.
   - Simpler esters like **CC(C)OC=O** are likely to fall in this range or slightly more negative.

3. **Oxygen-Containing Fragments**:
   - Alcohols (e.g., **CCCCCC(C)O**, **CC(C)O**) consistently have a value of **-0.82375223**.
   - Esters are less negative than alcohols but still negative.

4. **Bulkiness**:
   - **CC(C)OC=O** is a small ester (less bulky than aromatic esters), so it may not deviate far from the typical ester range.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to small aliphatic esters and the consistent trends for oxygen-containing functional groups, the predicted property value for **CC(C)OC=O** is:

**-0.50355759**  

This matches the values observed for other small esters/aliphatic oxygenates in the dataset.

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: -0.5934445564643406
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Rings (e.g., benzene rings)**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) often have property values around **0.0** unless they are substituted with polar or electronegative groups.
   - Substituted aromatic rings (e.g., with `-OH`, `-Cl`, `-Br`, `-NO2`, `-C=O`, etc.) tend to have negative or positive property values depending on the substituent's nature.

2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - `-OH` (phenol or alcohol): Often gives negative values (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl` = -0.82375223, `Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1` = -0.71789063).
   - `-C=O` (carbonyl): Can give negative values (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` = -0.8602385).
   - `-N-` (amine or amide): Can give negative or small positive values (e.g., `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` = 0.2380168, `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` = -0.87000208).
   - `-NO2`: Gives positive values (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` = 0.85853387).

3. **Symmetry and Halogen Substitution**:
   - Fully halogenated or symmetric aromatic rings (e.g., `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`, `c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1`) tend to have **0.0** property values.

4. **Amides and Ureas**:
   - Amides (`-CONH-`) often have negative or small positive values (e.g., `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` = -0.68805129, `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` = 0.68322145).
   - Ureas (`-NHCONH-`) or similar structures can have small positive values.

5. **Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - Molecules with multiple hydrogen bond donors/acceptors (e.g., `OCC(O)CO` = 0.61762332, `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` = 8.02279971) tend to have higher positive values.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, which is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms of the urea core (`-NHCONH-`). 

- The urea core is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding (both as donor and acceptor).
- The phenyl rings (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`) are unsubstituted, so they do not contribute significantly to the property value beyond their aromaticity.
- The molecule lacks strongly electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups (like `-NO2` or `-OH`), so the value is likely small.

### Similar Examples:
- `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (cyclic urea with alkyl groups) = **0.68322145**
- `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (amide with aromatic ring) = **0.2380168**
- `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` (amide with aromatic ring) = **-0.68805129**

The target molecule is closer to the first example (urea with aromatic rings), but the phenyl groups are less polar than alkyl groups, so the value might be slightly lower than 0.68322145 but still positive.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the urea core and the aromatic rings, the predicted property value is likely in the range of **0.2 to 0.6**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 0.45** (specific value could be closer to 0.5, but based on the examples, it is likely between 0.2 and 0.6). 

However, looking more closely at the examples, the urea/amide structures with aromatic rings tend to have values around **0.2 to 0.7**, so a more precise prediction would be:

**Final predicted value: 0.55** (similar to `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` but slightly lower due to lack of alkyl groups). 

Given the symmetry and lack of strong polar substituents, the value is likely **0.55**. 

But to match the closest example (`C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` = 0.68322145), we can adjust slightly downward for the phenyl groups:

**Final answer: 0.55** (approximate). 

If forced to pick a specific value from the examples, the closest is **0.68322145**, but adjusted for phenyl groups, **0.55** is reasonable. 

However, the examples suggest that aromatic ureas/amides are around **0.2 to 0.7**, so the exact value is likely in this range. 

Given no exact match, the best estimate is: **0.55**. 

But to be precise, let's average the closest examples:
- `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` = 0.68322145
- `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` = 0.2380168
Average: ~0.45

So, **final predicted value: 0.45**. 

But given the urea core is more dominant, leaning toward **0.55**. 

After reconsideration, the most accurate prediction based on the examples is:

**Predicted property value: 0.55** (specific value likely between 0.45 and 0.65). 

Given the uncertainty, the closest match is **0.55**. 

Thus, the answer is:

**0.55**

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe that the property value tends to be **0.0** for molecules that are purely aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or halogenated aromatics without polar or ionizable functional groups). 

The molecule in question is:  
**C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**  

This is **fluorene**, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with no polar or ionizable substituents. Based on the trend in the given data (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` and `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` both having a value of **0.0**), we can confidently predict that the property value for this molecule is:  

### **Predicted Property Value: 0.0**  

### Reasoning:  
- The molecule lacks functional groups that introduce polarity (e.g., -OH, -NH₂, -COOH, halogens beyond simple substitution).  
- Other purely aromatic systems in the dataset consistently show a value of **0.0**.  
- No significant electronic perturbations (e.g., strong electron-withdrawing/donating groups) are present to deviate from this trend.  

Thus, the predicted value is **0.0**.

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 10.665130347455774
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, we can deduce the following:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **High Property Values (> 3.0)**:
   - Typically associated with molecules containing multiple polar or charged groups (e.g., sulfonamides, nitro groups, or extensive hydrogen bonding networks). Example:
     - `O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O` → **3.976** (contains nitro and cyclic urea).
     - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O` → **4.638** (nitro and sulfonamide-like fragments).

2. **Moderate Property Values (0.3–3.0)**:
   - Seen in molecules with one or two polar/charged groups (e.g., amides, sulfonates, or heterocycles). Example:
     - `CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O` → **3.072** (sulfonamide and heterocycle).
     - `CC(C)(C)C(=O)C(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)n2cncn2` → **0.316** (amide and heterocycle).

3. **Low/Zero Property Values (≈ 0.0)**:
   - Common for nonpolar hydrocarbons (e.g., alkanes, aromatics without polar substituents). Example:
     - `CCC#CCC` → **0.0** (alkyne with no polar groups).

### Target Molecule Analysis:
**NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** contains:
- A **sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N)**, which is highly polar and often associated with higher property values (e.g., sulfonamides in the examples correlate with values > 3.0).
- Two **primary amine groups (NH₂)**, which add polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity.
- A **guanidine-like fragment (NC(=N)N)**, which is strongly polar and basic.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is `O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O` (property = **3.976**), which has a cyclic urea (polar) and nitro group. The target molecule lacks a nitro group but has a similarly polar sulfonamide and guanidine, suggesting a comparable or slightly lower value.
- Another similar example is `CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O` (property = **3.072**), which has a sulfonamide and heterocycle.

### Predicted Property:
Given the combined polarity of the sulfonamide, guanidine, and aromatic amine, the predicted property value is likely in the **moderate-high range (3.0–4.0)**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 3.5**  
*(This balances the contributions of the sulfonamide and guanidine, slightly lower than the nitro-containing examples but higher than simpler sulfonamides.)*

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 4.157572095638813
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and electronegative substituents (e.g., nitro groups, halogens, oxygen-containing groups). The property tends to be higher for molecules with multiple polar or charged groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, hydroxyl) and lower for simple hydrocarbons or less polar molecules.

For the molecule in question:  
**CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**  

Key features:  
1. Two nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**), which are strongly electron-withdrawing and polar.  
2. A trifluoromethyl group (**C(F)(F)F**), which is highly electronegative.  
3. A tertiary amine (**CCN(CC(C)=C)**), which can contribute polarity but is less impactful than the nitro/CF3 groups.  
4. An alkene (**CC(C)=C**), which adds minimal polarity.  

Comparison to similar examples:  
- **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O** (property = 3.405) has two nitro-like groups and a polar core.  
- **Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl** (property = 0.637) has one nitro-like group and a halogen.  
- **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = 0.859) has one nitro and one hydroxyl.  

This molecule has **two nitro groups + CF3**, which is more polar/electron-withdrawing than most examples. However, the tertiary amine and alkene slightly offset this.  

**Predicted property value: ~3.5**  
(Close to **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O**, which has a similar combination of polar groups.)  

**Final answer: 3.5** (rounded to one decimal place for consistency with the provided data).

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.8701007040657227
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can identify several patterns that correlate molecular structures with their property values:

1. **Simple Alkanes and Halogenated Alkanes**: Molecules like `C1CCCCCCC1` (cycloheptane), `ClC(Cl)Cl` (chloroform), and `ClC=C` (vinyl chloride) have a property value of **0.0**. These are typically non-polar or simple halogenated structures with no significant functional groups.

2. **Alcohols (`-OH`)**: Linear or branched alcohols like `CCCCCC(C)O` (heptanol), `CCCCCCCCO` (octanol), and `CCC(O)CC` (3-hexanol) consistently have a property value of **-0.82375223**. The presence of a single `-OH` group seems to assign this value.

3. **Aldehydes (`-CHO`)**: Molecules with an aldehyde group like `CCCC=O` (pentanal) and `O=C1CCCCC1` (cyclohexanone) have a value of **-0.76293362**. The aldehyde/ketone functionality appears to assign this value.

4. **Esters (`-COOR`)**: Molecules like `CC(C)CCOC=O` (isobutyl acetate) and `CCCCCOC(=O)C` (hexyl acetate) have a value of **-0.8701007**. The ester group seems to assign this slightly lower value compared to aldehydes.

5. **More Complex or Polar Groups**: Molecules with multiple functional groups (e.g., nitro, amide, sulfonamide) or aromatic systems with polar substituents tend to have higher positive values (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has **0.85853387**).

### Prediction for `CC(C)OC=O`:
This molecule is **isopropyl formate**, an ester (`-COOR`) where:
- The `OC=O` is the ester group.
- The `CC(C)` is the isopropyl group.

From the examples, esters like `CC(C)CCOC=O` and `CCCCCOC(=O)C` have a property value of **-0.8701007**. The structure `CC(C)OC=O` is very similar (just a smaller ester with isopropanol instead of butanol or hexanol). 

Thus, the predicted property value for `CC(C)OC=O` is:  
**-0.8701007**

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.8237522337520979
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Hydrocarbons and Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - Molecules like **CC(C)C**, **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**, and **CCI** have a property value of **0.0**. These are typically non-polar or symmetrically substituted halogenated compounds.
   - **Cc1ccccc1C** (toluene derivative) also has a value of **0.0**.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CO** (methanol) has a value of **-0.82375223**.
   - **c1ccccc1O** (phenol) has the same value of **-0.82375223**, suggesting that a single hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring gives this value.
   - **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde) has a value of **-0.76293362**, which is slightly higher than phenol.
   - More hydroxyl groups (e.g., **COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1**) lead to much higher values (e.g., **3.76321932**).

3. **Substituted Aromatic Rings**:
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1** (xylene-like) would likely be **0.0** based on similar examples.
   - Adding a hydroxyl group (**O**) to an aromatic ring with alkyl substituents (e.g., **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**) would likely follow the trend of phenol, giving **-0.82375223**.

4. **Other Trends**:
   - Multiple polar groups (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**) lead to very high values (**10.50188668**).
   - Nitrogen-containing groups can increase or decrease the value depending on the context.

### Prediction for **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**:
This is a methyl-substituted phenol (specifically, 3-methylphenol or m-cresol with an additional methyl group). The key features are:
- Aromatic ring with two methyl groups (non-polar, typically contributing **0.0**).
- One hydroxyl group (contributing **-0.82375223**, as seen in phenol and methanol).

The methyl groups are unlikely to significantly alter the property value beyond what is observed for phenol, as they are non-polar and do not introduce additional polarity or hydrogen bonding. Thus, the property value should be the same as phenol: **-0.82375223**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** is **-0.82375223**.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: -0.8676702488468742
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular substructures and functional groups. Here are the key observations:

1. **Phenyl rings with hydroxyl (-OH) groups** (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1`, `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl`) consistently have a property value of **-0.82375223**, unless other strongly influencing groups are present.

2. **Phosphorothioate (P=S) groups** (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl`) consistently have a property value of **-0.86767025**, suggesting this group dominates the property when present.

3. **Aromatic rings with thioether (-S-) or thiol (-SH) groups** (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O`) can significantly alter the property, but the exact effect depends on the context.

4. **Simple aliphatic or non-polar structures** (e.g., `CC(C)C(C)(C)C`, `CCC#CCC`) tend to have a property value of **0.0**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule in question is:  
**`COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1`**

- It contains a **phosphorothioate (P=S) group** (`COP(=S)(OC)`), which is strongly associated with **-0.86767025** in the examples.
- The rest of the molecule is an aromatic ring with:
  - A **thioether (-S-) substituent** (`SC`), which is not directly present in the examples but is somewhat similar to the phosphorothioate group in terms of sulfur contribution.
  - A **methyl (-CH3) group**, which is neutral (does not significantly affect the property in other examples).
  - An **ether linkage (-O-)**, which is also present in the phosphorothioate examples without altering the property.

Given that the **P=S group dominates the property** and the other substituents do not appear to significantly shift it in the examples, the most reasonable prediction is the same as the other phosphorothioate-containing molecules.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.86767025**

Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, we can deduce the following:

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly halogenated aromatic systems** (especially with Cl or Br) tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain other functional groups that significantly alter the property (e.g., sulfonamides, nitro groups, or complex heterocycles). Examples:
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` → **0.0**
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` → **0.0**
   - `ClC(Cl)Cl` → **0.0**
   - `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` → **0.0**

2. The target molecule is a **polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure** with no additional functional groups (only Cl substituents). This matches the examples where fully halogenated aromatics yield **0.0**.

3. The presence of **S(N)(=O)=O (sulfonamide)** or **N(=O)=O (nitro)** groups in other examples leads to non-zero values (e.g., 4.6427217, 7.83553063), but these are absent here.

### Conclusion:
The property value for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is predicted to be:  
**0.0**  

This aligns with the trend observed for similar polychlorinated aromatic systems in the provided data.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.5133685983205183
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's break down the structural features that seem to correlate with the property values:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CC, C=C, C1CCCCC1, CCC)**: Typically have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain functional groups that modify the value.
2. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - When attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N`), the value is **-0.30045966**.
   - In `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (multiple nitro groups on an aromatic ring), the value is very high (**12.5064405**).
   - In `Nc1ccccc1O` (nitro group not present, but hydroxyl and amino), the value is **-0.36943963**.
3. **Aliphatic nitro compounds**:
   - No direct examples, but nitro groups generally increase the property value compared to hydrocarbons.
   - The nitro group is polar and electron-withdrawing, likely contributing positively to the property.

### Analysis of CCCN(=O)=O:
- The molecule is **n-propyl nitrite/nitro** (aliphatic nitro compound).
- It lacks aromaticity or other complex functional groups.
- Compared to simple hydrocarbons (value = 0.0), the nitro group should increase the property value, but not as dramatically as in poly-nitro aromatics.

### Closest Analogues:
- `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (aromatic with nitrile groups): **-0.30045966**.
- `Nc1nc[nH]n1` (non-aromatic nitro-like N-heterocycle): **1.27450664**.
- `CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` (aromatic with nitro groups): **4.1575721**.

Given that **CCCN(=O)=O** is aliphatic with one nitro group, the value is likely **positive but modest**, similar to `Nc1nc[nH]n1` but adjusted for the lack of heterocyclic complexity.

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.5** (estimated based on structural similarity and nitro group contribution). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend that nitro groups increase the value, with aliphatic nitro being less impactful than aromatic nitro.) 

However, reviewing the examples again, the closest simple nitro-containing aliphatic molecule is not present, so this is an interpolation. If forced to pick from the given examples' range, a reasonable estimate is **~1.0 to 2.0**. 

**Final prediction: 1.27450664** (same as `Nc1nc[nH]n1`, as both have a nitro-like N-containing functional group in a non-aromatic context). 

But since `CCCN(=O)=O` is simpler, a slightly lower value like **0.8** might also fit. Given the uncertainty, I'd lean toward **1.0**. 

However, the exact value cannot be precisely derived without more examples. 

**Adjusted prediction: 0.79936063** (same as `CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1`, another N-containing aliphatic compound). 

Given the options, **0.8** is the most defensible. 

**Final answer: 0.79936063**

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate the molecular structure with the property value.

### Observations:
1. **Simple halogenated aromatics with no other functional groups tend to have a property value of 0.0**:
   - `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1`: 0.0 (chloro and bromo substituents on benzene)
   - `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`: 0.0 (multiple chloro substituents on biphenyl)
   - `BrC(Br)Br`: 0.0 (bromoform, no aromaticity but simple halogenation)
   - `c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12`: 0.0 (brominated naphthalene)
   - `C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13`: 0.0 (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with no polar groups)

2. **Molecules with polar or functional groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, amino, hydroxy) deviate from 0.0**:
   - `NC(=O)N`: 1.435 (urea, highly polar)
   - `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1`: 2.146 (cyclic urea derivative, more polar)
   - `Oc1ccc(O)cc1`: -0.617 (catechol, polar hydroxy groups)
   - `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`: -0.513 (nitro group on toluene)

3. **Halogenated aromatics with no other functional groups consistently have a property value of 0.0**, as seen in the examples above.

### Analysis of `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`:
- This is a simple halogenated benzene ring with a fluorine (`F`) and a bromine (`Br`) substituent. 
- It has no other functional groups (no nitro, carbonyl, amino, hydroxy, etc.).
- It is structurally similar to `Clc1ccc(Br)cc1` (property = 0.0) and `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` (property = 0.0), where the only substituents are halogens.

### Conclusion:
Since `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` is a simple halogenated aromatic with no additional polar or functional groups, its property value is **0.0**, consistent with the observed trend in the given examples.

### Predicted property value for `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`: **0.0**

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.8237522337520979
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a tertiary alcohol (**C(OH)**) and a rigid, fused bicyclic structure (steroid-like or terpene-like framework). 
   - No highly polar or ionizable groups (e.g., acids, amines, or strong hydrogen bond donors/acceptors beyond the alcohol).

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** resembles steroid/terpene-like structures in the dataset (e.g., **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**, which has a high value of 4.736). However, this molecule lacks the additional polar groups (e.g., ketones, fluorines) that contribute to higher values.
   - Simpler alicyclic alcohols like **CC(C)(C)CO** and **CCCC(C)(C)O** have values around **-0.82**, but these are linear/flexible, not rigid bicyclic.
   - The rigid bicyclic framework with a single alcohol group is somewhat similar to **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**, which has a value of **-0.717**.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Rigid, hydrophobic frameworks with minimal polar groups tend to have values closer to zero or slightly negative (e.g., **CCCC(C)C1(CC=C)C(=O)NC(=S)NC1=O** has **0.409** due to the thiourea group; our molecule lacks such features).
   - The alcohol group introduces some polarity, but the bulky hydrophobic framework dominates.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (value: **-0.717**) but with slightly less polarity (no ketone), the value should be slightly more negative. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.75** (approximate, likely between -0.7 and -0.8). 

This aligns with the trend where rigid, hydrophobic alicyclic structures with one polar group (e.g., alcohol) have moderately negative values.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.22758751975696806
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question (`CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`), here's the reasoning for the predicted property value:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Phosphorus-Containing Compounds**: 
   - The molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` has a property value of **0.22758752**. This is structurally similar to the query molecule, as both contain a `P(=S)(OCC)` group and a `C(=O)c1ccccc1C=O` fragment. The main difference is the replacement of `SC(CCl)` with `N2C(=O)` in the query molecule.

2. **Impact of Substituents**:
   - The presence of aromatic rings (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) often results in small or zero values unless paired with strongly polar or charged groups (e.g., `N(=O)=O`, `C#N`, or `C(=O)O`).
   - The `P(=S)` group appears to contribute moderately to the property value, as seen in the example above (0.22758752).

3. **Comparison to Other Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with `N2C(=O)` (e.g., lactams or imides) tend to have small positive or negative values unless combined with other polar groups (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)` in this case).

### Query Molecule Analysis:
- The query molecule has:
  - A `P(=S)(OCC)` group (similar to the example with value 0.22758752).
  - A `N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` fragment (a cyclic imide with an aromatic ring, which is less polar than the `SC(CCl)` group in the example).
- The replacement of `SC(CCl)` with `N2C(=O)` likely reduces the property value slightly because the thioether (`S`) and chloroalkyl (`CCl`) groups are more polarizable than the cyclic imide.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to the example with value **0.22758752** and the slightly less polarizable substituent in the query molecule, the predicted value would be **slightly lower**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**0.15** (rounded from an interpolated value between 0.22758752 and 0.0).

However, since the example with `P(=S)(OCC)` is the closest match and the differences are minor, the exact value is likely close to **0.22758752**. For consistency with the given data, the predicted value is:  
**0.22758752** (same as the closest matching example). 

But considering the reduced polarity of the imide vs. the thioether+chloroalkyl, a more precise adjustment would suggest:  
**0.20** (approximate). 

Given the examples, the most defensible answer is:  
**0.22758752** (same as the closest match). 

### Final Answer:
**0.22758752**

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -0.8696014298685482
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Polar Substituents**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings and polar substituents (e.g., carbonyl groups, nitro groups, halogens) tend to have negative property values. 
   - Example: **CCCCOC** (-0.50355759), **O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (-0.76293362).

2. **Heterocyclic Aromatic Systems**:
   - Molecules with nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, pyrrole, imidazole) often have negative values.
   - Example: **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32** (-0.73114914), **c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2** (-0.73114914).

3. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - The presence of carbonyl groups (especially in conjugated systems) is associated with negative values.
   - Example: **CCCCCC(=O)C** (-0.76293362), **CCC(=O)C** (-0.76293362).

4. **Neutral or Zero Values**:
   - Simple hydrocarbons or molecules with no polar/functional groups tend to have a property value of 0.0.
   - Example: **CC(C)CC(C)(C)C** (0.0), **C1CCCCCC1** (0.0).

5. **Special Cases with High Positive Values**:
   - Some complex structures with multiple functional groups (e.g., **OCC1OC(C(O)C1O)n2cnc3c(O)ncnc23**, 13.65338504) have very high positive values, but these are outliers.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** has the following features:
1. **Aromatic System**: Contains a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) and a fused heterocyclic ring (c1cc(=O)n...n1).
2. **Carbonyl Group (C=O)**: The **cc(=O)** moiety is present, which is polar and conjugated with the aromatic system.
3. **Nitrogen Heterocycle**: The **n(c2ccccc2)n1** structure resembles nitrogen-containing heterocycles like imidazole or pyridine derivatives.
4. **Methyl Groups**: Two methyl groups (**Cc1...n1C**) are present, but these are non-polar and unlikely to dominate the property.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32** (-0.73114914): Similar nitrogen-containing fused aromatic system.
- **O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (-0.76293362): Similar conjugated carbonyl with aromatic rings.
- **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (-0.77728011): Very similar structure with a carbonyl and nitrogen heterocycle.

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to molecules with property values around **-0.73 to -0.78**, and the presence of a conjugated carbonyl and nitrogen heterocycle, the predicted property value for **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** is approximately:

**-0.77** (likely close to -0.77728011, the value for the very similar molecule **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O**). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.77728011** (same as the closely related example).

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.8701007040657227
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCCC, Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1) consistently have a property value of 0.0.

2. Molecules with ester groups (COC=O, CCCCCOC(=O)OC) have values around -0.87.

3. The presence of carboxylic acid derivatives seems to affect the property value similarly to esters.

4. The molecule in question, CCCCCC(=O)OCC, is an ester (hexanoic acid ethyl ester).

Comparing with similar ester structures in the examples:
- COC=O (methyl formate): -0.8701007
- CCCCCOC(=O)OC (hexyl carbonate): -0.8701007

The ester functional group appears to be the dominant feature determining the property value in these cases, with the alkyl chain length having minimal impact on the value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCC(=O)OCC (ethyl hexanoate) is: -0.8701007

Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, and functional groups. Let's analyze the given molecule and compare it to similar examples:

**Molecule to predict:**  
`COC(=O)c1ccccc1`  
This is methyl benzoate, which consists of a benzoate ester (aromatic ring with an ester group: -COOCH3).

**Similar examples from the dataset:**  
1. `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` (ethyl benzoate): Property value = **-0.8701007**  
   - Very similar structure, just with an ethyl group instead of methyl.  
2. `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1` (ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate): Property value = **-0.35528737**  
   - Similar ester but with an additional polar hydroxyl group, increasing the value.  
3. `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC` (methyl terephthalate-like): Property value = **0.0**  
   - More complex ester with two carboxylate groups, leading to a neutral value.  

**Key observations:**  
- Simple aromatic esters (e.g., methyl/ethyl benzoate) tend to have **negative property values** around **-0.8 to -0.9**.  
- The presence of additional polar groups (e.g., -OH) increases the value.  
- The methyl benzoate (`COC(=O)c1ccccc1`) is almost identical to ethyl benzoate (`CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1`), which has a value of **-0.8701007**.  

**Prediction:**  
Since methyl benzoate is structurally very similar to ethyl benzoate (only differing by a -CH2- unit), its property value should be **very close to -0.8701007**.  

### Final predicted property value:  
**-0.8701007**  

*(This matches the trend observed for simple aromatic esters in the dataset.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can observe that the property value tends to be **0.0** for simple hydrocarbons (especially those with only carbon and hydrogen atoms and no functional groups or significant structural complexity). Examples include:

- `CC/C=C/C` (a simple alkene) → 0.0  
- `CCC(C)(C)CC` (a branched alkane) → 0.0  
- `CCCc1ccccc1` (a simple alkyl-substituted benzene) → 0.0  
- `C1CCCC1` (cyclopentane) → 0.0  
- `C=Cc1ccccc1` (styrene-like structure) → 0.0  

The molecule `C=CCC=C` is a simple linear diene (1,3-butadiene) with no functional groups or heteroatoms. Given the pattern in the examples, such molecules consistently have a property value of **0.0**.

### Predicted property value for `C=CCC=C`: **0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe certain patterns in the property values:

1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., C1CCCCC1, CCCC(C)C, CCC=C) and symmetric halogenated aromatics (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1)** tend to have a property value of **0.0**. This suggests that symmetric, non-polar, or minimally functionalized molecules often default to this value.

2. **Highly polar or polyfunctional molecules (e.g., OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, Nc3nc(N)c2nc(c1ccccc1)c(N)nc2n3)** have very high positive values, likely due to extensive hydrogen bonding or other strong intermolecular interactions.

3. **Halogenated alkanes or small molecules with limited polarity (e.g., FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br, Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1)** also tend to have a property value of **0.0**, unless they have additional functional groups contributing to polarity.

4. The molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane) is a symmetric, fully halogenated alkane with no additional functional groups. It is analogous to other symmetric halogenated molecules like **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** or **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**, which have a property value of **0.0**.

### Predicted Property Value for BrC(Br)Br:
**0.0**

This prediction aligns with the trend observed for symmetric, non-polar, or minimally functionalized halogenated molecules in the provided examples.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.22758751975696806
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons/halogenated hydrocarbons**: Typically have a property value of **0.0** (e.g., `c1ccc2ccccc2c1`, `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl`, `CCC(C)Cl`).
2. **Polar or functionalized molecules**: Non-zero values, often positive or negative, depending on the functional groups and complexity:
   - Phosphorothioates (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1`) have negative values (e.g., **-0.67449076**).
   - Aromatic systems with polar groups (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O`) have positive values (e.g., **3.6403673**).
   - Molecules with multiple hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., sugars like `OCC1OC(CO)(...)C1O`) have very high values (e.g., **73.03111544**).
   - Molecules with amides, carbonyls, and heterocycles often have intermediate values (e.g., `CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O` has **1.16074949**).

### Analysis of the given molecule:
The molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` has:
1. A **phosphorothioate group** (`P(=S)(OCC)`), similar to `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property = **-0.67449076**).
2. A **thioether linkage** (`SC(CCl)`).
3. A **lactam/aromatic system** (`N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`), which adds polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- The phosphorothioate group suggests a negative contribution (like **-0.67449076**).
- The lactam/aromatic system may add a slight positive contribution (e.g., `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` has **0.70540198**).
- The overall molecule is more polar than simple hydrocarbons but less polar than highly functionalized sugars.

### Predicted property:
Given the balance between the negative phosphorothioate contribution and the positive lactam/aromatic contribution, the predicted value is likely **slightly negative**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.45**  

This aligns with the trend of phosphorothioates having negative values while accounting for the additional polar groups.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 2.8075524033549937
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Polar Functional Groups** (e.g., -OH, -NH₂, -NO₂, -C=O, -S=O, halogens) tend to lower the property value (more negative). For example:
   - Phenols (`Cc1ccc(O)cc1`, `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O`) have a value of **-0.82375223**.
   - Amides (`CN(C)C(=O)C`) have **-0.82496589**.
   - Nitro groups (`Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`) have **-0.5133686**.

2. **Nonpolar/Aliphatic Chains** (e.g., `CCCCCC#C`, `CC=C(C)C`) have a value of **0.0**.

3. **Complex Heterocycles or Conjugated Systems** with polar groups can further lower the value (e.g., `Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23` has **-0.85106551**).

4. **Highly Polar or Ionic Groups** (e.g., `Nc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`) can increase the value significantly (e.g., **1.44069928** for a nitroaniline).

5. **Halogen Substitution** (Cl, Br) often leads to **0.0** unless paired with other polar groups (e.g., `ClCCC#N` has **-0.86217559** due to the nitrile group).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The structure is:
```
CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
```
Key features:
- **Tertiary amide (`CN(C)C(=O)N-`)**: Similar to `CN(C)C(=O)C` (**-0.82496589**), but here it's part of a larger conjugated system.
- **Chlorinated aromatic ring (`c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)`**: Adds polarity (Cl substitution alone often gives 0.0, but combined with other polar groups, it lowers the value).
- **Heterocycle (`n2nc(oc2=O)`)**: A polar, electron-withdrawing oxadiazole-like ring (similar to other heterocycles with values around **-0.85**).
- **Bulky tert-butyl group (`C(C)(C)C`)**: Nonpolar, but its steric effects may not dominate the polar contributions.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
1. `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` (**-0.86058757**): A similar tertiary amide with no additional polar groups.
2. `Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23` (**-0.85106551**): A heterocyclic system with polar groups.
3. `ClCCC#N` (**-0.86217559**): A polar nitrile with a halogen.

Given the combination of:
- A tertiary amide,
- A chlorinated aromatic ring,
- A polar heterocycle with a ketone (=O),
the property value should be slightly more negative than **-0.86058757** (due to additional polar groups) but not as extreme as highly ionic systems (e.g., nitroaniline).

### Predicted Value:
**-0.86767025**  
This matches the value seen for other molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., `CCOc1ccc(cc1)C(C)(C)COCc3cccc(Oc2ccccc2)c3` has the same value). The combination of amide, halogen, and heterocycle justifies this prediction.

### Final Answer:
**-0.86767025**

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: -0.8575394734703422
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Polar Functional Groups**: 
   - Molecules with multiple polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NO₂, -CN, -COO⁻) tend to have higher positive property values (e.g., 38.10453427 for the large sugar-like molecule with multiple -OH and -CN groups).
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, F) alone do not necessarily increase the property value unless combined with other polar groups.

2. **Aromatic Systems with Polar Substituents**:
   - Simple aromatic rings with -OH or -Cl (e.g., **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**) have a property value of **-0.82375223**.
   - Aromatic rings with -NH₂ or -NO₂ (e.g., **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1**) have values around **-0.87**.

3. **Symmetry and Multiple Halogens**:
   - Molecules with multiple halogens (e.g., **ClC(Cl)(Cl)C#N**) have slightly more negative values (e.g., **-0.86217559**).
   - Symmetrical dihalogenated aromatics (e.g., **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2**) have a property value of **0.0**.

4. **Ether Linkages (-O-)**: 
   - Ethers (e.g., **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl**) tend to have values around **-0.82** unless combined with other polar groups.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** consists of:
- Two aromatic rings linked by an ether (-O-) group.
- Each ring has one -OH and one -Cl substituent, and one ring has an additional -Cl.

This is structurally similar to:
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (property = **-0.82375223**), but with an additional aromatic ring and -Cl.
- The ether linkage and multiple -Cl/-OH groups suggest a value in the same range as other polar aromatic systems.

### Prediction:
Given the symmetry, presence of -OH and -Cl, and ether linkage, the property value is likely similar to other such molecules in the dataset. The most plausible prediction is:

**-0.82375223** (same as **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** and other similar structures). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.82375223**
==================================================
Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the molecule `CC/C=C\C` (which is a representation of 2-pentene with a trans configuration) is structurally similar to `CC/C=C/C` (4th example in the list), which has a property value of **0.0**. 

The presence of a simple alkene (C=C) in a hydrocarbon chain without additional functional groups (e.g., carbonyl, nitro, halogens, etc.) consistently correlates with a property value of **0.0** in the given dataset (e.g., `Cc1cc(C)c(C)cc1C`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`, `c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1`, etc.). 

Thus, the predicted property value for `CC/C=C\C` is:  
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.5035575898901236
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe the following patterns in the property values:

1. Simple alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and unsubstituted hydrocarbons (e.g., CC#C, C, C1CCCCCC1) typically have a property value of 0.0.

2. Molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups (especially alcohols -OH) often have a value of -0.82375223 (e.g., CC(C)O, CCC(O)CC).

3. Ethers (R-O-R') show different behavior:
   - Simple ethers like CCCOCC (your query molecule) aren't present in the examples, but similar ether-containing compounds show varied values.
   - COc1ccccc1O (methoxyphenol) has -0.85753947
   - CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) has -0.8701007

4. The value -0.82375223 appears frequently for alcohols and some other oxygen-containing compounds.

For CCCOCC (propyl ether), which is a simple aliphatic ether without additional functional groups:
- It's more similar to basic hydrocarbons than to complex oxygenated compounds
- No hydroxyl group is present
- The ether oxygen alone doesn't seem to trigger the negative values in simple cases (based on the pattern)

Therefore, the most reasonable prediction is: 0.0

Predicted property value for CCCOCC: 0.0

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.8242092413505698
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - The molecule contains two phenyl rings (`c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2`), which are common in the examples and often contribute to a property value around **0.0** when unsubstituted or with simple substitutions (e.g., `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has a value of 0.0).
   - It has a tertiary amide group (`N(C(=O)N...)`), which is polar but not strongly acidic or basic.
   - The `C(C)(C)` (tert-butyl) group is bulky but not highly polar or charged.

2. **Comparison to Similar Examples**:
   - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: Two phenyl rings linked by a non-polar spacer, property = **0.0**.
   - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3**: Contains a phenyl ring and a polar amide-like group, property = **-0.54281521**.
   - **Nc1cccc2ccccc12**: Aromatic with a weakly polar amine, property = **-0.87000208**.
   - **CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1**: Aromatic with a polar amide, property = **-0.68805129**.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of two phenyl rings and a tertiary amide suggests moderate polarity but no strong contributing factors (e.g., nitro groups, strong hydrogen bonding, or highly polar substituents).
   - The tert-butyl group adds steric bulk but no significant polarity.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to molecules with property values around **-0.5 to -0.7**, and the lack of strongly polar or charged groups, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.65**  

This aligns with the trend observed for aromatic molecules with weakly polar substituents (e.g., amides) but no strongly contributing features (like nitro or hydroxyl groups). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.65**
==================================================
Iteration: 45
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.8602384977017804
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on structural features.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes (e.g., CCCC, C=C, C≡C)**:
   - Tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless functionalized with polar groups (e.g., OH, Br, etc.).

2. **Aromatic Rings (e.g., benzene derivatives)**:
   - Unsubstituted or symmetrically substituted (e.g., Cc1cc(C)c(C)cc1C) often have **0.0**.
   - Polar substituents (e.g., OH, Br, NO2, COOH) tend to lower the property value (negative values).
   - Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO2, Br) or electron-donating groups (e.g., OH, NH2) can influence the value.

3. **Amides (e.g., C(=O)N)**:
   - Presence of amide groups (e.g., C(=O)N) often leads to negative values (e.g., -0.82420924 for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2).

4. **Bromine Substituents (Br)**:
   - When Br is present on an aromatic ring (e.g., Fc1cccc(Br)c1), the value is often **0.0** unless combined with other polar groups.

5. **Combination of Amide and Aromatic Bromine**:
   - No exact match in the examples, but similar molecules (e.g., Cc1ccc(N)cc1 has -0.87000208; Br-substituted aromatics often have 0.0 unless other polar groups are present).

### Analysis of **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**:
- The molecule is **N-acetyl-4-bromoaniline**, with:
  - An amide group (**C(=O)N**) attached to an aromatic ring.
  - A bromine substituent (**Br**) on the aromatic ring.
- The amide group is polar and likely dominates the property value, pushing it toward negative values (similar to other amides in the examples).
- The Br substituent alone would suggest 0.0, but the amide group overrides this.

### Closest Analogues in Examples:
1. **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**: -0.82420924 (amide + aromatic).
2. **Cc1ccc(N)cc1**: -0.87000208 (aromatic amine).
3. **Oc1ccc(Br)cc1**: -0.82375223 (phenol + Br, similar to our case but with OH instead of NHAc).

### Prediction:
Given the dominance of the amide group and the lack of other strongly polarizing features, the property value is likely similar to other aromatic amides in the dataset. The Br substituent does not significantly alter the value (as seen in other Br-substituted aromatics with polar groups).

**Predicted Property Value: -0.82**  
(Approximately matching the trend for aromatic amides, e.g., -0.82420924 or -0.82375223). 

### Final Answer:
**-0.82375223**  
(Matches the phenol + Br case, which is structurally similar in terms of polarity).

Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns for the property values:

1. **Hydrocarbons (only C and H)** without functional groups or unsaturation (e.g., `CCCCCCC#C`, `CC1CCCCC1`, `CCC=C`) tend to have a property value of **0.0**.  
   - Example: `CCCCCCC#C` (alkyne) = 0.0, `CC1CCCCC1` (cyclohexane derivative) = 0.0, `CCC=C` (alkene) = 0.0.

2. **Aromatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1N`, `C=Cc1ccccc1`, `CCc1ccc(C)cc1`) with simple alkyl substitutions tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain functional groups (e.g., `-N`, `-NO2`, `-OH`).  
   - Example: `C=Cc1ccccc1` (styrene derivative) = 0.0, `CCc1ccc(C)cc1` (alkyl-substituted benzene) = 0.0.

3. **Functional groups** (e.g., `-OH`, `-NO2`, `-C=O`, `-N`, `-S=O`) significantly influence the property value, often making it non-zero (either positive or negative).  
   - Example: `Cc1ccccc1N` (aniline derivative) = -0.87000208, `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (nitrophenol) = 0.85853387.

4. **Branched aliphatic alcohols** (e.g., `CC(C)CO`, `CCCC(C)O`, `OC1CCCCC1`) consistently have a property value of **-0.82375223**.  

### Prediction for `CC(C)Cc1ccccc1`:
- This molecule is an **alkyl-substituted benzene** (isobutylbenzene), consisting of only C and H atoms with no functional groups or unsaturation beyond the aromatic ring.  
- Similar examples (e.g., `CCc1ccc(C)cc1`, `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1`, `C=Cc1ccccc1`) all have a property value of **0.0**.  
- No functional groups or polar features are present to deviate from this trend.  

Thus, the predicted property value for `CC(C)Cc1ccccc1` is:  
**0.0**

Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.7629336172618066
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities:

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple aromatic aldehydes/ketones**: 
   - **Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1** (a heterocyclic ketone) has a value of **-0.39422094**.
   - **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a steroid ketone) has a value of **-0.50355759**.
   - **CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1** (an aliphatic ketone) has a value of **-0.76293362**.

2. **Aromatic systems with polar groups**:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (an aromatic amide + hydroxyl) has a high value (**0.85387385**), likely due to the combined effect of the amide and phenol.
   - **COc1ccccc1** (anisole) has a value of **-0.50355759**, suggesting that an electron-donating group (methoxy) reduces the property value compared to plain benzene (which would be 0.0).

3. **Benzene derivatives**:
   - Plain benzene or non-polar substituted benzenes (e.g., **Cc1cccc2c(C)cccc12**, **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45**) have a value of **0.0**.
   - Polar substituents (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, nitro groups) increase the value significantly (**3.6554449**).

### Analysis of **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde):
- The aldehyde group (**C=O**) is polar and electron-withdrawing, similar to the ketone in **Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1** (-0.39422094) but less polar than a nitro group.
- It is more polar than anisole (**COc1ccccc1**, -0.50355759) but less polar than **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (0.85387385).
- The property value is likely negative due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the aldehyde, but not as extreme as aliphatic ketones (e.g., -0.76293362).

### Predicted Value:
Given the examples, a reasonable estimate for **O=Cc1ccccc1** is:  
**-0.45** (interpolating between the heterocyclic ketone and anisole values).

However, looking more closely, the aldehyde is structurally simpler than the heterocyclic ketone but similar in polarity, so a value closer to **-0.39422094** (like the heterocyclic ketone) is plausible. 

### Final Prediction:
**-0.39** (rounded to match the precision of the given examples).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend of polar groups reducing the value relative to plain benzene.)*

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 9.719270413225628
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule, I can attempt to predict the property based on structural features that seem to correlate with the property values in the training set. Here's my reasoning:

Key observations from the training data:
1. Molecules with simple halogen substitutions (Cl, Br, I) or plain hydrocarbons tend to have property values of 0.0
2. Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) often correlate with slightly negative values (e.g., -0.01515195 in the first example)
3. Multiple heteroatoms and complex conjugated systems tend to give more negative values
4. The presence of both nitro and amide groups appears to give moderately negative values
5. Fused ring systems with heteroatoms often show negative values

The target molecule: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2
Structural features:
- Contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Has two amide groups (C(=O)N)
- Contains a fused heterocyclic system
- Has conjugation throughout the molecule

Comparing with similar molecules in the training set:
- The molecule with Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 (which has a nitro group and ether linkage) has -0.01515195
- Molecules with multiple amides and heterocycles tend to be in the -0.5 to -0.7 range
- The presence of the nitro group might make it slightly less negative than pure amide systems

Considering these factors, I would predict the property value to be in the moderately negative range, similar to other molecules with multiple polar functional groups and conjugated systems.

Predicted property value: -0.57678447

This matches well with similar complex heterocyclic molecules containing nitro groups and amide functionalities in the training set.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.8637888919927996
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question, `N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`, let's break down the patterns observed in the data to predict the property value.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - `Nc1ccccc1` (aniline) has a property value of **-0.87000208**.
   - `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (azobenzene-like structure) has a value of **-0.8669604**.
   - The molecule `N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` is a diphenylamine derivative, where the nitrogen is linked to two phenyl rings (similar to the azobenzene case but without the double bond).

2. **Impact of Nitrogen Connectivity**:
   - Nitrogen attached to aromatic rings tends to give negative property values (e.g., aniline: -0.87000208, diphenylamine-like structures: ~-0.86 to -0.87).
   - The presence of additional nitrogen or substituents can slightly modulate the value (e.g., azobenzene: -0.8669604 vs. aniline: -0.87000208).

3. **Symmetry and Conjugation**:
   - The molecule `N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` is symmetric and conjugated, similar to `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`, but with a single bond instead of a double bond. This would likely place its value close to the azobenzene case but slightly more negative due to reduced conjugation (single bond vs. double bond).

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (-0.8669604) and `Nc1ccccc1` (-0.87000208), the property value for `N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` is expected to be **between these two values**, likely closer to the diphenylamine-like systems. 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**-0.868** (approximate midpoint between -0.8669604 and -0.87000208). 

For consistency with the provided examples (which often report 8 decimal places), we can round to:  
**-0.86800000**. 

However, since the examples show slight variations even for similar structures, a reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.868**. 

But given the exact match with the diphenylamine-like systems in the data, the most precise prediction is:  
**-0.87000208** (same as aniline, as the nitrogen environment is nearly identical). 

After reconsidering, the closest analog is `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (-0.8669604), and replacing =N- with -NH- would slightly increase the negativity (but not significantly). Thus, the final predicted value is:  
**-0.868**. 

However, the most confident match is with the aniline value (**-0.87000208**), as the nitrogen's electronic environment is very similar. 

### Final Answer:  
**-0.87000208** (same as `Nc1ccccc1`, as the nitrogen is bonded to two phenyl rings, closely resembling the aniline case). 

---
**Note**: Without explicit training or a clear rule, this prediction is based on structural analogy to the closest examples in the given data. The value is likely very close to -0.87.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 2.1465027996461723
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's break down the structural features and correlate them with the property values from the training data:

### Key Observations from Training Data:
1. **Lactams/Cyclic Amides**:  
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** has a property value of **2.1465028**.  
   - **O=C1CCCN1** (simpler 5-membered lactam) has a value of **-0.8602385**.  
   - The presence of multiple carbonyls (e.g., **C(=O)N**) in cyclic structures tends to increase the property value compared to non-cyclic or less polar structures.

2. **Ring Strain and Conjugation**:  
   - The target molecule has a **6-membered ring (CCCC1)** fused to a **5-membered diketopiperazine-like structure (O=C2NC(=O)...C(=O)N2)**. This introduces rigidity and conjugation, similar to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC**, but with less steric bulk.

3. **Polarity and H-Bonding**:  
   - The two **N-C=O** groups in the target molecule enhance polarity and H-bonding capacity, analogous to the higher-value examples (e.g., **4.1575721** for nitro/trifluoromethyl-substituted aromatics, but here with amides).

4. **Neutral/Aliphatic Cases**:  
   - Simple aliphatic/aromatic structures (e.g., **CCCCCC(C)C**, **c1ccccc1C**) consistently have a value of **0.0**, while polar/functionalized molecules deviate.

### Target Molecule Analysis:
- The structure is a **diketopiperazine derivative** with a fused cyclohexane ring.  
- It lacks strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like **NO₂** or **CF₃**), but the **two amide carbonyls** and **cyclic conjugation** suggest a moderate positive property value.  
- Comparable to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC (2.1465028)**, but with fewer substituents, we expect a slightly lower value.

### Predicted Property Value:
**1.8**  
*(Rationale: Intermediate between the simpler lactam (-0.86) and the bulkier diketopiperamide (2.15), accounting for its balanced polarity/rigidity.)*  

---  
*Note: This is a heuristic estimate based on structural analogs in the training data. For precise predictions, computational modeling or experimental measurement would be required.*

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question (`Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`), we can deduce the following:

1. **Observed Patterns**:
   - Simple halogenated aromatic compounds (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1Cl`, `Ic1ccccc1`) have a property value of **0.0**.
   - The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) on aromatic rings without other functional groups consistently results in a value of 0.0.
   - The molecule in question is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) derivative with chlorine atoms on both aromatic rings (`Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`). This is structurally similar to the examples where halogenated aromatics have a value of 0.0.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - No additional functional groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, amine, etc.) are present in the molecule that would deviate from the trend observed for simple halogenated aromatics.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The property value for `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` is predicted to be **0.0**, consistent with the behavior of other halogenated aromatic compounds in the provided examples.

**Predicted property value: 0.0**

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. Simple alkylbenzenes (like CCCCc1ccccc1) tend to have property values around 0.0
2. Substituted benzenes with alkyl groups (like CCc1ccccc1N) have slightly negative values (~ -0.87)
3. The presence of multiple alkyl substitutions on benzene tends to make the value more negative
4. The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is diethylbenzene, which has two ethyl groups on a benzene ring

Comparing with similar structures:
- Cc1ccccc1N (methylaniline): -0.87000208
- CCCCc1ccccc1 (butylbenzene): 0.0
- CCc1ccccn1 (ethylpyridine): -0.64388874

The diethyl substitution pattern would likely make the value more negative than methylaniline but less negative than ethylpyridine (due to the nitrogen in the latter). 

Given that butylbenzene is 0.0 and methylaniline is -0.87, and considering the symmetrical diethyl substitution, the predicted value would be slightly less negative than methylaniline but more negative than butylbenzene.

Predicted property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1: -0.82375223

This matches well with other similarly substituted cyclic compounds in the dataset (like CC45CCC2C(CCC3CC1SC1CC23C)C4CCC5O which also has -0.82375223). The exact value appears multiple times in the dataset for molecules with similar complexity and substitution patterns.

Iteration: 53
SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 3.6403673003122425
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro Groups (NO₂)**: 
   - Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have higher property values (e.g., 4.1575721, 3.6554449, 1.44069928). 
   - The presence of multiple nitro groups further increases the value (e.g., 4.1575721 for two nitro groups).

2. **Sulfonamide Group (S(N)(=O)=O)**:
   - The sulfonamide group is structurally and electronically similar to nitro groups (both are strong electron-withdrawing groups). 
   - In the given examples, sulfonamide-like groups are not explicitly present, but nitro groups serve as a proxy due to their similar properties.

3. **Aromatic Systems with Electron-Withdrawing Groups**:
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂, SO₂NH₂) tend to have higher property values compared to plain aromatic systems (e.g., Cc1ccccc1, property = 0.0).

4. **Other Functional Groups**:
   - Neutral or non-polar molecules (e.g., halogens, plain hydrocarbons) tend to have property values close to 0.0.
   - Polar or hydrogen-bonding groups (e.g., OH, COOH) can reduce the property value (e.g., -0.82375223 for phenolic groups).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** has:
- An aromatic ring with an amino group (NH₂) and a sulfonamide group (SO₂NH₂).
- The sulfonamide group is strongly electron-withdrawing, similar to nitro groups, and likely contributes significantly to the property value.
- The amino group (NH₂) is electron-donating but less impactful than the sulfonamide.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
1. **Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (property = 1.44069928):
   - This has one nitro group and one amino group. The property is moderately high.
2. **Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12** (property = 2.82253126):
   - This is a purine-like structure with multiple nitrogen atoms, contributing to a higher value.
3. **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**:
   - The sulfonamide group is slightly less electron-withdrawing than a nitro group but still significant. 
   - The presence of both NH₂ and SO₂NH₂ suggests a property value between 1.44069928 (one NO₂) and 2.82253126 (multiple nitrogens in a ring).

### Predicted Property:
Given the above reasoning, the property value for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** is likely in the range of **1.8 to 2.2**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 2.0** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the correlation between molecular features and the given values.)

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe a pattern in the property values:

1. **Aromatic hydrocarbons** (especially polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) consistently have a property value of **0.0**. Examples include:
   - `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` (fully chlorinated biphenyl, aromatic backbone)
   - `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` (chlorinated biphenyl)
   - `C1CCCCCC1` (cyclohexane, non-aromatic but purely hydrocarbon)
   - `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` (polycyclic aromatic)
   - `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccccc32` (polycyclic aromatic)
   - `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` (polycyclic aromatic)
   - `C1CCCC1` (cyclopentane, non-aromatic but purely hydrocarbon)
   - `CCCCBr` (simple hydrocarbon with Br, no aromaticity)
   - `CCc1ccccc1CC` (alkyl-substituted benzene)
   - `CCCCCCc1ccccc1` (alkyl-substituted benzene)

2. The molecule in question, `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34`, is a **polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH)** with a structure resembling pyrene or a similar fused aromatic system. Based on the consistent trend for PAHs and purely hydrocarbon systems in the examples, its property value is **0.0**.

Iteration: 55
SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 7.366912673162551
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule, I can attempt to predict the property based on structural features and trends observed in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Key observations from the dataset**:
   - Molecules with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups tend to have higher positive values (e.g., OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O has 8.02279971)
   - Aromatic systems with multiple -OH groups also show moderately positive values (e.g., Oc1cccc(O)c1 has -0.6178778)
   - The presence of carbonyl (C=O) groups in conjugation with aromatic systems increases the value
   - Fully halogenated aliphatics (e.g., CCl4, CHCl3) consistently show 0.0
   - Complex fused ring systems with oxygen functionalities have higher values

2. **Target molecule analysis**: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
   - Contains 4 hydroxyl (-OH) groups (highly polar)
   - Has a conjugated carbonyl (C=O) group
   - Contains two aromatic rings connected through an oxygen bridge
   - Structural similarity to flavonoids or catechol derivatives

3. **Comparison to similar molecules in dataset**:
   - Most similar to OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5 (value: 1.60639102) but with more -OH groups
   - Also similar to Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 (value: 1.18915264)

4. **Adjustment factors**:
   - Additional -OH groups should increase the value compared to these references
   - The lack of a fully conjugated system like in flavonoids might moderate the increase

Given these observations, I would predict the property value to be approximately **1.8 ± 0.2**. The exact prediction would be:

**1.75642318**

Iteration: 56
SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 0.19513079734371577
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCCC, CCCCBr, Cc1cccc(C)c1, CC=C(C)C)**: These have a property value of **0.0**. This suggests that neutral, non-polar, or inert structures default to 0.0 unless other functional groups are present.
2. **Phosphorothioate/Phosphate Esters (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl)**: These tend to have negative values around **-0.4 to -0.8**, likely due to the electronegativity of P=O/S and substituents like Cl or aromatic rings.
3. **Amides/Carbamates (e.g., NC(=O)c1cccnc1, CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2)**: These can range from slightly positive (~0.2) to highly positive (~2.3), depending on conjugation and additional functional groups.
4. **Nitro Groups (e.g., Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O)**: These contribute significantly to positive values, especially when multiple nitro groups are present (e.g., 3.655 for dinitro).
5. **Hydroxy/Alcohol Groups (e.g., CCC(O)CC, CCCC(C)(C)O)**: These often give values around **-0.82**, suggesting a consistent contribution from -OH.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** has the following features:
- A **phosphate group (P=O)** with mixed substituents: 
  - One **O-methyl (OCH3)** group (neutral/mildly polar).
  - One **N-acetyl (NC(C)=O)** group (amide-like, slightly positive contribution).
  - One **thiolate (S-)** group (polarizable, likely negative contribution).
- The structure resembles phosphoramidates/thioates, which in the examples have values around **-0.4 to -0.8**.

### Closest Matches:
1. **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: -0.867 (P=S, aromatic Cl substituents).
2. **COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: -0.441 (P=O, Cl substituents).
3. **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**: -0.674 (P=S, amide, thioether).

Given that our target has:
- P=O (less negative than P=S).
- N-acetyl (slightly positive, but less than nitro groups).
- S- (negative contribution, but not as strong as Cl substituents).

### Prediction:
The value is likely between **-0.4 and -0.7**. A reasonable estimate is **-0.55**, balancing the contributions of P=O, N-acetyl, and S-.

### Final Answer:
**-0.55** (approximate, based on structural analogies).
==================================================
Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), we can predict its property value based on the following observations:

1. **Simple, symmetric, non-polar molecules** (e.g., **CC1CCCC1**, **CCCC(C)C**, **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2**) tend to have a property value of **0.0**. These are typically hydrocarbons or symmetric halogenated compounds without strong polar or functional group effects.

2. **Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br, F) but no other functional groups** (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**, **CCBr**) also tend to have a property value of **0.0** if they are symmetric and lack polar/ionic features.

3. **1,2-Dichloroethene (Cl\C=C/Cl)** is a small, symmetric molecule with no additional functional groups (just two chlorines on a double bond). It is non-polar (or very weakly polar due to the C-Cl bonds canceling each other out in the symmetric trans/cis forms).

Thus, based on the trend for symmetric, non-polar halogenated molecules in the dataset, the predicted property value for **Cl\C=C/Cl** is:

**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.6438887356683176
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), I can make the following observations:

1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Most purely aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., benzene derivatives without polar substituents) have a property value of **0.0**. Examples:
     - `Cc1cc(C)c2ccccc2c1` (methyl-substituted naphthalene) → 0.0
     - `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43` (large polyaromatic) → 0.0
     - `Cc1cccc2c1Cc3ccccc32` (methyl-substituted fluorene) → 0.0
   - Pyridine (**c1ccncc1**) is an aromatic heterocycle, but it contains a nitrogen atom, which introduces polarity.

2. **Nitrogen-Containing Aromatics**:
   - `CNc1ccccc1` (N-methylaniline) → -0.61394386
   - `CN2C(=O)CN=C(c1ccccc1)c3cc(ccc23)N(=O)=O` (complex nitro-substituted heterocycle) → 2.21339875
   - `Cc1ncnc2nccnc12` (methyl-substituted purine analog) → -0.06745347
   - `COc5cc4OCC3Oc2c1CC(Oc1ccc2C(=O)C3c4cc5OC)C(C)=C` (complex heterocycle with oxygen and nitrogen) → 0.84457268
   - Pyridine is simpler than these but has a nitrogen lone pair that could influence the property.

3. **Polar vs. Nonpolar**:
   - Nonpolar or weakly polar molecules (e.g., halocarbons, pure hydrocarbons) tend to have values of 0.0.
   - Polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -CO) introduce negative or positive deviations from 0.0.
   - Pyridine is polar due to the nitrogen lone pair but lacks additional functional groups.

4. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `CNc1ccccc1` (N-methylaniline) has a nitrogen in the ring but also an extra methyl group; property = -0.61394386.
   - `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` (nitrogen-rich polyaromatic) → -0.86976056.
   - Pyridine is simpler and less polar than these, so its value should be closer to 0.0 but not zero due to the nitrogen.

### Predicted Property for Pyridine (**c1ccncc1**):
Given the above trends, pyridine likely has a **small negative value** due to its aromatic nitrogen but no other functional groups. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.3**  
(Intermediate between 0.0 for nonpolar aromatics and -0.61394386 for N-methylaniline). 

However, looking at simpler nitrogen-containing aromatics like `Cc1ncnc2nccnc12` (-0.06745347), pyridine might be even closer to zero. Thus, a refined prediction is:

**Final predicted property value: -0.1**  
(Reflecting mild polarity from the nitrogen lone pair). 

But given the variability in the data, **-0.2 to -0.3** is also plausible. For specificity, I'll choose:

**-0.2** as the predicted value. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data.)

Iteration: 59
SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 4.506996105198819
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, aromaticity, halogenation, and functional group contributions (e.g., hydroxyl groups, carbonyls, nitro groups, etc.). Here's how I would approach predicting the property for the molecule:

**Molecule:**  
`OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23`

### Key Features:
1. **Hydroxyl groups (`OCC(O)CO`):**  
   - Multiple hydroxyl groups (like in `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO`, which has a high value of **10.50188668**) significantly increase the property value due to hydrogen bonding and polarity.

2. **Ester linkage (`COC(=O)`):**  
   - Present in examples like `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC` (value **0.0**) and `CCCOC(=O)CC` (value **-0.8701007**). This suggests a slight negative contribution but not dominant.

3. **Aromatic ring with substituents (`c1ccccc1N`):**  
   - Aniline-like structure (`N` attached to aromatic ring) appears in examples like `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (value **-0.01842824**), suggesting a small negative or neutral contribution.

4. **Chlorinated aromatic system (`cc(Cl)ccc`):**  
   - Chlorine on aromatic rings (e.g., `Clc1ccc(I)cc1`, value **0.0**) often contributes little unless paired with other polar groups.

5. **Heteroaromatic ring (`Nc2ccnc3`):**  
   - Pyridine-like nitrogen in an aromatic system (similar to `c1ccc2cnccc2c1`, value **-0.64388874**) may contribute negatively.

6. **Overall polarity and H-bonding:**  
   - The molecule has 2 hydroxyl groups, an ester, and an aromatic amine, making it quite polar. The hydroxyl groups likely dominate the property value.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (value **10.50188668**), but this has 5 hydroxyl groups. Our molecule has 2 hydroxyls, so the value should be lower but still positive.
- Other polar molecules with fewer hydroxyls (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`, value **4.25827491**) suggest a high positive value when multiple H-bonding groups are present.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above, the molecule's property value is likely **between 2.0 and 4.0**, leaning toward the higher end due to the combined effect of hydroxyls and other polar groups. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 3.5** (approximate, based on similar examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured, this is an educated guess based on trends in the data. The true value could vary if the property depends nonlinearly on molecular features.)

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.8237522337520979
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and polarity. For the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), we can analyze its features:

1. **Functional group**: It has a terminal hydroxyl group (-OH), which is polar and can form hydrogen bonds. This is similar to molecules like **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol) and **CC(C)(C)C(C)(C)O** (tert-butanol), which have property values of **-0.82375223** and **-0.82375223**, respectively.
2. **Chain length**: It is a linear 5-carbon alcohol, which is less complex than cyclic or branched alcohols but more polar than simple alkanes (e.g., **CCCc1ccccc1**, which has a value of **0.0**).
3. **Polarity**: The -OH group dominates the property, and linear alcohols with -OH groups in the dataset tend to have negative values around **-0.8**.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for **CCCCCO** is likely similar to other simple aliphatic alcohols in the dataset. 

### Predicted property value: **-0.82375223** (same as other simple alcohols with -OH groups in the examples). 

This matches the trend where non-aromatic, non-heterocyclic alcohols with a single -OH group have this value.

1. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: Present in many examples, often associated with moderate negative or near-zero values (e.g., `-0.64388874` for pyridine-like rings, `0.0` for simple benzene derivatives).
2. **Sulfonyl Group (S(=O)(=O))**: Polar and electronegative, often seen in molecules with moderate property values (e.g., `0.29932564` for a phosphorothioate with aromatic groups).
3. **Amide Linkage (C(=O)N)**: Present in molecules like `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (property `2.1465028`), but this molecule has additional complexity.
4. **Heterocycle (CCO1 with S=O and C=C)**: Similar to sulfonamide or sulfone-containing heterocycles, which can have varied values depending on substituents.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The molecule resembles a hybrid of aromatic, sulfonyl, and amide features. Examples with these motifs often have property values in the range of **0.0 to 2.0**.
- The presence of the sulfonyl group and aromatic system suggests a value closer to **0.3–1.0**, similar to `CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C` (`0.29932564`) or `O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (`0.40998601`).

### Predicted Value:
Given the structural similarity to sulfonamide-like molecules with aromatic systems, the predicted property value is:  
**0.40998601** (rounded to 0.41 if needed).

This aligns with the moderate polarity and aromaticity of the molecule, placing it in the middle of the observed range.

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 7.479264462740647
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule, I can attempt to predict the property value based on structural features that correlate with the provided data. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic nitro compounds (N(=O)=O)** tend to have moderately negative values around -0.5 (e.g., `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` and `CC(C)N(=O)=O` both have -0.5133686).
2. **Esters (C(=O)OC)** often contribute to negative values (e.g., `CCCCC(=O)OC` has -0.8701007).
3. **Aromatic systems with no strongly polar groups** typically have a value of 0.0.
4. **Complex fused ring systems with polar groups** can have more negative values (e.g., `CC(=O)C3(C)CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` has -0.79278101).

### Target Molecule:
`COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C`  
This molecule has:
- An aromatic nitro group (`N(=O)=O`).
- Two ester groups (`C(=O)OC`).
- A fused aromatic system with a nitrogen heterocycle.
- No strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups beyond the nitro and esters.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
1. The nitro group (likely contributing ~-0.5).
2. Two ester groups (each contributing negatively, similar to `CCCCC(=O)OC` at -0.87).
3. The fused aromatic system may slightly reduce the magnitude compared to simpler nitro/ester examples.

The combined effect suggests a value more negative than -0.5 but not as extreme as -0.87. A reasonable interpolation is around **-0.7**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: -0.68805129**  
*(This matches the pattern of similar molecules like `CC1=C(CCCO1)C(=O)Nc2ccccc2` which has -0.68805129 and shares some structural features.)*

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 2.1465027996461723
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). The amide groups are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding, which often correlates with certain property values in the dataset.
2. **Symmetry and Rigidity**: The molecule is symmetric and rigid due to the cyclopropane ring and the fused amide rings. Symmetric, rigid molecules with polar groups in the dataset often have property values around **0.0** unless other strongly contributing features are present (e.g., long aliphatic chains or additional polar groups).
3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **amide groups** (e.g., **ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, property = **0.84643091**) can have elevated property values, but this example also has aromatic rings and halogen substitutions, which may contribute.
   - Simple cyclic or symmetric molecules (e.g., **C1CCCCC1**, **Clc1cccc(I)c1**, **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32**) tend to have property values of **0.0** unless they have additional functional groups or asymmetry.
   - The given molecule lacks long aliphatic chains, halogens, or aromatic systems, which are features that often shift the property value away from **0.0** in the dataset.

### Predicted Property:
Given the symmetry, lack of aromaticity/halogens, and the presence of amide groups (which are balanced in this symmetric structure), the most plausible property value is **0.0**. This aligns with similar symmetric, non-aromatic, and moderately polar molecules in the dataset.

### Final Answer:
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe the following patterns in the property values:

1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., C1CC=CC1, CCCCC, CCC1CCCCC1, C1CCC=CCC1)** have a property value of **0.0**. These molecules lack functional groups or heteroatoms that significantly influence the property.

2. **Chlorinated aromatic compounds (e.g., Clc1ccccc1, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, Clc1ccccc1I)** also have a property value of **0.0**, suggesting that aromatic chlorination alone does not affect the property.

3. **Simple aliphatic chlorinated compounds (e.g., ClCC)** are not explicitly listed in the examples, but we can infer their behavior based on similar cases. Since ClCC is a very simple molecule (chloroethane) with no additional functional groups or complexity, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would also be **0.0**, analogous to other simple halogenated or hydrocarbon structures.

4. The property values deviate from 0.0 when the molecules contain more complex functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, thiols, amines, heterocycles, etc.), which is not the case here.

### Predicted property value for ClCC: **0.0**

Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: -0.6438887356683176
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, we can deduce the property value by comparing structural features and trends from the dataset:

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds**:  
   - Molecules like **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** and **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2** have a property value of **0.0**. These are chlorinated aromatic systems with no strongly polar or functionalized substituents.
   - However, **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl** (with a nitro group) has a value of **-0.5133686**, indicating that electronegative substituents (like NO₂) slightly lower the property.

2. **Chlorinated Heterocycles**:  
   - The target molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** contains a pyridine ring (nitrogen heterocycle) with multiple chlorines, including a CCl₃ group.  
   - Similar chlorinated heterocycles (e.g., **c2ccc1ocnc1c2**) have values around **-0.87**, but this is for fused systems.  
   - The CCl₃ group is present in **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O**, which has a value of **-0.71566862**, suggesting a moderate negative contribution.

3. **Electronegativity and Symmetry**:  
   - The CCl₃ group is highly electronegative but symmetric, which often results in a net property of **0.0** unless paired with other polar groups (e.g., NO₂, OH).  
   - The pyridine nitrogen adds polarity, but the lack of additional functional groups (like NO₂ or OH) suggests a value closer to neutral.

### Prediction:
Given the absence of strongly polarizing substituents (like NO₂ or OH) and the symmetry of the CCl₃ group, the property value is likely **0.0**, consistent with other halogenated aromatics/heterocycles without additional functionalization.

### Final Answer:
**0.0**

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.8237522337520979
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for molecules with an alcohol (OH) group attached to an aliphatic chain tends to be **-0.82375223**. This is consistently observed in the following molecules from the dataset:

- **CCCC(O)CCC** → -0.82375223  
- **CC(O)c1ccccc1** → -0.82375223  
- **CCC(C)CCO** → -0.82375223  
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** → -0.82375223 (phenol, but same property)  
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** → -0.82375223 (chlorinated phenol, same property)  

The molecule **CCCCC(C)O** is structurally similar to these examples, as it is an aliphatic alcohol (specifically, 2-hexanol). Therefore, the predicted property value is:

**Predicted property value: -0.82375223**
==================================================
Iteration: 67
SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I observe that the property value tends to be **0.0** for molecules that are simple halogenated aromatic compounds (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl`, `ClCCl`, `ClC(Cl)Cl`, `ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl`) or purely hydrocarbon-based structures without significant polar or functional groups (e.g., `c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1`, `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C`). 

The molecule in question, **`Brc1ccc(Br)cc1`**, is a **dibrominated benzene** (1,4-dibromobenzene), which fits the pattern of simple halogenated aromatics with no additional functional groups. 

### Predicted Property Value: **0.0**  

This aligns with the trend where such symmetrical, non-polar halogenated aromatics consistently exhibit a property value of 0.0 in the given dataset.

Iteration: 68
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe a pattern in the property values based on the molecular structures:

1. **Fully halogenated aromatic compounds** (e.g., `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) and **fully halogenated aliphatic compounds** (e.g., `ClC(Br)Br`) consistently have a property value of **0.0**. This suggests that heavy halogenation (especially with Cl or Br) nullifies the property.

2. The molecule in question, `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl`, is a **fully chlorinated biphenyl derivative** (similar to the second example in the list, which is a fully chlorinated biphenyl with a property of 0.0). 

3. There are no functional groups or structural features in this molecule that would deviate from the trend observed in the examples (e.g., no polar or ionizable groups like `-OH`, `-NO2`, `-C=O`, etc., which are present in molecules with non-zero property values).

Thus, based on the consistent pattern in the provided data, the predicted property value for `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl` is:

**0.0**

Iteration: 69
SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: -0.4414323568500582
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule, I can attempt to predict the property based on structural features and trends observed in the training data. Here's my reasoning:

1. The property appears to be related to molecular polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and presence of certain functional groups. Values range from negative (more polar/hydrogen bonding) to positive (intermediate polarity) to zero (nonpolar).

2. The target molecule has:
   - A central phosphate group (P=O with two aryloxy groups and one hydroxyl) - this is highly polar and can hydrogen bond
   - Two aromatic rings (one with a methyl group) attached to the phosphate
   - Overall moderate size but with significant polar character

3. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - Molecules with phosphate groups (like CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O) have values around 0.227
   - Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and polar groups tend to have values between -0.8 and 0.8
   - The phosphate with aromatic attachments suggests moderate polarity

4. The closest analogs seem to be molecules with phosphate esters combined with aromatic systems, which typically show values in the low positive range (0.2-0.8).

Given these observations, I would predict the property value for Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1 to be approximately:

**0.22758752**

This matches well with other phosphate-containing aromatic compounds in the training set while accounting for the additional aromatic rings which might slightly increase the value compared to simpler phosphate esters.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -0.8249658889434157
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, here's the reasoning for the predicted property value:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O)**:
   - Strongly increase the property value (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` → **1.44069928**).
   - Presence often correlates with values > 1.0.

2. **Halogens (Cl, Br, I, F)**:
   - Alone (e.g., `ClCC#N` → **-0.86217559**) or in simple aromatic systems (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` → **-0.5133686**) tend to decrease or neutralize the property.
   - **Trifluoromethyl (CF3)**: The example `FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` includes this group, which is electronegative but not strongly correlated with high values in the examples.

3. **Ketones (C=O)**:
   - Neutral or slightly negative impact unless combined with other polar groups (e.g., `CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` → **0.59607175**).

4. **Complex Heterocycles**:
   - Systems like `N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O` (a chlorinated pyrrolidinone) are not directly represented in examples, but similar fragments (e.g., `NC(C)(C)C#N`) appear in higher-value molecules (e.g., **3.6917338**).

5. **Combined Effects**:
   - The target molecule has:
     - A **trifluoromethyl (CF3)** group (moderate impact).
     - A **chlorinated pyrrolidinone** (likely positive contribution).
     - No nitro or strongly polarizing groups (e.g., sulfonamides, which drive values up in examples like **9.7909489**).

### Prediction:
The molecule lacks extreme polarizing groups (e.g., nitro or sulfonamide) but has moderate polarity from CF3 and the chlorinated ketone. Based on similar examples:
- `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` → **-0.5133686** (chloro + nitro).
- `CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` → **0.59607175** (ketones + moderate complexity).

The target molecule likely falls in the **low-positive range** due to the combined effects of CF3 and the chlorinated heterocycle, but not as high as nitro-containing compounds.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.5** (approximate, considering structural analogs). 

For higher precision, exact matches would be needed, but this is a reasonable estimate given the examples. 

---
**Final Answer:** **0.5** (estimated based on analogous structures).

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.015151946667643206
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro Group (NO₂) Impact**:
   - The presence of a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) often increases the property value significantly. For example:
     - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (dinitrobenzene) has a value of **3.6554449**.
     - `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C` has a value of **7.47926446**.
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing and polar, which seems to contribute to higher property values.

2. **Ether Linkage (O-R)**:
   - The methoxy group (`OCH₃`) is present in some molecules, but its effect is less pronounced than the nitro group. For example:
     - `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` has a value of **0.0** (likely due to symmetry or lack of polar groups beyond the ester).
     - `COc1ccccc1` (anisole) is not explicitly in the examples, but similar aromatic ethers with no other polar groups tend to have low or zero values.

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - When a nitro group is attached to an aromatic ring with an ether (e.g., `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`), the property value is expected to be higher than a simple nitrobenzene but lower than a dinitro compound.

4. **Specific Example Comparison**:
   - The closest example is `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (dinitrobenzene) with a value of **3.6554449**. 
   - Since `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has only one nitro group (and a methoxy group), its value should be lower than 3.6554449 but still significantly higher than molecules without nitro groups.

### Prediction:
Given the strong influence of the nitro group and the moderate influence of the methoxy group, the predicted property value for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is likely in the range of **1.5 to 3.0**. 

A reasonable estimate, based on the examples, is:  
**Predicted property value: 2.5** (approximate, as exact interpolation isn't possible without more data). 

However, looking more closely, `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (two nitro groups) is 3.655, so one nitro group might be roughly half of that. The methoxy group could add a slight increase. Thus, a more precise guess would be:  
**Predicted property value: 2.0**. 

But since `Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2` (a polar heterocycle) is -0.811, and nitro is much stronger, I'd lean toward the higher end of the range. 

Final answer:  
**Predicted property value: 2.8**. 

(Note: Without a clear definition of the property, this is an educated guess based on trends in the data.) 

However, looking back at `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` (-0.576) and `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C` (7.479), the nitro group's effect is highly variable. Given that, for a simple nitroanisole, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 2.5**. 

But to match the scale better, let's say:  
**Predicted property value: 3.0**. 

Given the uncertainty, I'd average the expectations and say:  
**Predicted property value: 2.8**. 

But since the examples suggest nitro groups can push values higher, and this is a mononitro compound, I'll settle on:  
**Predicted property value: 3.0**. 

After reconsidering, the most consistent estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 2.5**. 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O: 2.5** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: For precise predictions, a model trained on this data would be needed. This is a heuristic guess.) 

However, looking at `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (3.655) and `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (0.0), the nitro group is the dominant factor. For one nitro group, halving the dinitro value gives ~1.8, and the methoxy adds some, so:  
**Final predicted value: 2.0**. 

Given the variability, I'll stick with:  
**Predicted property value: 2.0**. 

But to be safe, let's average the two closest guesses: (3.0 + 2.0)/2 = 2.5. 

Thus, the final answer is:  
**Predicted property value: 2.5**. 

---

After careful consideration, the most plausible prediction is:  
**Predicted property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O: 2.5**.

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, symmetry, and halogenation. Here are some observations:

1. **Halogenated alkanes/cyclics (e.g., ClCCCl, BrC(Br)Br, ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl)**: These molecules tend to have a property value of **0.0**, likely due to their symmetry and lack of strongly polar or conjugated systems.

2. **Aromatic systems with halogens (e.g., Clc1ccccc1, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1)**: These also often have a property value of **0.0**, unless paired with strongly polar or electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro groups, which increase the value significantly).

3. **Highly halogenated, asymmetric, or strained systems**: These may deviate from 0.0 if they introduce significant polarity or strain, but many still default to 0.0 if no other functional groups are present.

The molecule in question is:
**ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**

This is a highly chlorinated polycyclic structure, resembling hexachlorocyclopentadiene or similar persistent organic pollutants. Key features:
- Multiple chlorines introduce steric and electronic effects.
- The structure is rigid and likely symmetric or nearly symmetric.
- No strongly polar or conjugated systems beyond the C-Cl bonds.

Given the examples of similarly halogenated systems (e.g., ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, BrC(Br)Br), which all have a property value of **0.0**, this molecule is also likely to have:

**Predicted property value: 0.0**

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.8701007040657227
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or features that correlate with the property values:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., C1CCCCCC1, CCC#C, CCCC#C, Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1)**: These typically have a property value of **0.0**, indicating no significant contribution to the property.
2. **Oxygen-containing functional groups**:
   - **Alcohols (e.g., CC(O)c1ccccc1, CCCCC(O)CC)**: Tend to have a value around **-0.82375223**.
   - **Ethers (e.g., O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2)**: Have a value of **-0.50355759**.
   - **Esters (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1)**: Have a value of **-0.01842824**.
   - **Carboxylic acids or aldehydes (C=O)**: When part of a more complex structure, they can contribute to higher or lower values depending on context.
3. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**: Strongly increase the property value (e.g., **3.6554449** for O=N(=O)c1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O).
4. **Highly polar or multifunctional molecules (e.g., OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO)**: Can have very high values (e.g., **10.50188668**).

### Analysis of CCCOC=O:
- The molecule is **propyl formate**, an ester (R-COO-R').
- From the examples, esters seem to have values close to zero or slightly negative:
  - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**: -0.01842824 (ester with an aromatic ring and amine).
  - **CCCOC=O** is a simpler aliphatic ester, so its value might be similar or slightly more negative due to the lack of aromatic stabilization.

### Predicted Property:
Given the simplicity of **CCCOC=O** and its similarity to other esters in the dataset, a reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.02** (close to zero, similar to other aliphatic esters).

However, since the only pure aliphatic ester example (CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1) has a value of **-0.01842824**, we can approximate:  
**Predicted property for CCCOC=O: -0.018**.  

This aligns with the trend that esters have near-zero contributions unless combined with other functional groups.
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.8701007040657227
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule is a **fatty acid ester**, specifically **decyl acetate** (a long aliphatic chain with an ester group: **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**).
   - The ester group (**C(=O)OCC**) is polar but not as strongly polar as carboxylic acids or highly electronegative substituents (e.g., nitro or sulfonamide groups).
   - The long aliphatic chain (**CCCCCCCCC**) is hydrophobic and nonpolar.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with long aliphatic chains and no strongly polar groups (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**, **CCC1CCCCC1**) have a property value of **0.0**.
   - Molecules with ester-like groups (e.g., **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C**) have small deviations from 0 (e.g., 0.227).
   - The ester group here is not conjugated or strongly electron-withdrawing, so its contribution is likely modest.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The molecule lacks strongly polar or charged groups (e.g., nitro, sulfonamide, hydroxyl, or amine groups), which are associated with higher absolute values in the examples.
   - The ester group may introduce a slight polarity, but the long hydrophobic chain dominates, pulling the value closer to 0.

### Predicted Property:
Given the dominance of the nonpolar aliphatic chain and the modest polarity of the ester, the property value is likely very close to **0.0**, similar to other aliphatic esters or hydrocarbons in the examples. 

However, since the ester group might introduce a slight deviation, a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted value: -0.5 to 0.0**.  

Given the examples like **CCOc1ccccc1** (ether + aromatic, value = -0.503) and **COCC(=O)N(...)** (value = 0.227), this ester is likely on the lower end of that range.  

**Final prediction: -0.50355759** (matching the trend for ether/ester-containing molecules with no strong polar effects).

**Answer: -0.50355759**

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 4.637726317605648
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule:

**Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Structural Features**:
   - The molecule has a phenol group (`Oc1ccc...`), which is present in some of the examples (e.g., `Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1` with property `-0.82375223`).
   - It has two chlorine substituents (`Cl`), which appear in many examples (e.g., `COc1ccc(Cl)cc1` with `-0.50355759` and `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl` with `-0.85753947`).
   - It contains a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`), seen in `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` with `-0.5133686`.
   - It has an amide linkage (`C(=O)N`), similar to `NC(=O)c1ccccc1` with `-0.51548382`.

2. **Combining Contributions**:
   - Phenol + Cl: The phenol with Cl substituents tends to give values around `-0.5` to `-0.8` (e.g., `Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1` is `-0.82375223`).
   - Nitro group: Adds a slight negative contribution (e.g., `-0.5133686` in `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`).
   - Amide group: Adds a slight negative contribution (e.g., `-0.51548382` in `NC(=O)c1ccccc1`).
   - The presence of two Cl atoms and the nitro group may further lower the value compared to simpler phenol or chloro-substituted examples.

3. **Closest Analogues**:
   - `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl` has two Cl and an ether linkage, giving `-0.85753947`.
   - `Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (no Cl or nitro) gives `-0.82375223`.
   - The nitro group's effect is somewhat similar to the amide, so we can expect a value slightly more negative than `-0.85753947`.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Given the additional nitro group and amide, the value should be more negative than `-0.85753947` but not drastically so (since nitro and amide contributions are moderate).
   - A reasonable estimate is around `-0.9` to `-1.0`.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**-0.92** (This is an educated guess based on the trends in the provided examples.)

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 0.1936670647767417
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule, I can deduce the following patterns for the property:

1. **Zero Property (0.0)**: 
   - Molecules with simple hydrocarbon chains (e.g., `CCCCCCCC`, `C=Cc1ccccc1`), halogenated aromatics without polar groups (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl`), or symmetrical non-polar structures.
   - No hydrogen-bonding donors or acceptors, or strong dipoles.

2. **Non-Zero Property**:
   - Molecules with hydrogen-bonding donors/acceptors (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1` → 2.1465028, `CCCC(O)C=C` → -0.82375223).
   - Polar functional groups like carbonyls, hydroxyls, amines, or sulfonamides contribute to non-zero values.
   - Negative values often correlate with aliphatic alcohols or electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `CCCC(O)C=C` → -0.82375223).
   - Positive values correlate with cyclic amides (e.g., hydantoins) or nitro groups (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` → 0.85853387).

### Target Molecule: `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1`
- **Structure**: Contains two phosphate-thioate (`P(=S)(OC)`) groups linked via a thioether (`S`) and aromatic rings. 
- **Key Features**:
  - No hydrogen-bond donors (only P=O/S and ether linkages).
  - Symmetrical, with bulky, polar but non-hydrogen-bonding groups (P(=S)(OC)).
  - Similar to `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl` or `CCSSCC` (symmetrical, no H-bond donors), which have **0.0**.
  - Phosphorothioates are polar but lack strong H-bonding capacity in this context.

### Prediction: **0.0**  
The molecule's symmetry, lack of H-bond donors, and resemblance to other non-polar/halogenated examples suggest the property value is **0.0**.

Iteration: 77
SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.8585338706808899
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitrophenol-like structures**: 
   - The molecule resembles nitrophenol (a phenol with a nitro group). 
   - Example: **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** has a property value of **0.85387385**, but this is an amide-substituted phenol, not a nitro-substituted one.
   - Another example: **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** has a value of **-0.01515195**. This is a more complex structure with two chlorine atoms and an ether linkage, but it includes the **N(=O)=O** (nitro) group.

2. **Nitro group impact**:
   - The nitro group (**N(=O)=O**) appears to reduce the property value compared to similar structures without it (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has a value of **-0.5133686**, while simple aromatic hydrocarbons like **c1ccccc1** or **Clc1cccc(Br)c1** have values of **0.0**).

3. **Phenol vs. nitrophenol**:
   - Simple phenols (e.g., **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**) have values around **-0.82375223**, but adding a nitro group seems to make the value less negative (closer to zero).

4. **Similar structure**:
   - The closest example is **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** with a value of **-0.01515195**. Removing the chlorine substituents and simplifying to **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol) would likely result in a slightly more negative value due to the absence of the electron-withdrawing chlorines.

### Prediction:
Given the above, **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol) is expected to have a property value between **-0.5133686** (for **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**) and **-0.01515195** (for the more complex nitro-chloro example). 

A reasonable estimate is **-0.3**, but looking at the trend, the value is likely closer to **-0.4** to **-0.5**. 

However, since **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (methylnitrobenzene) is **-0.5133686**, and nitrophenol has an additional hydroxyl group (which may slightly offset the nitro group's effect), the value might be slightly less negative. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is:  
**-0.37344691** (matching the value of another nitro-containing molecule in the examples, **CCC1(CCC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2**, which is structurally different but has a similar nitro-like contribution).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is **-0.37344691**.

Iteration: 78
SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 73.03111544325228
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and functional group composition. The molecule in question is a complex carbohydrate (specifically, a branched oligosaccharide or polysaccharide derivative) with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and ether linkages (-O-). 

From the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` with a value of **4.25827491**) tend to have high positive property values, likely due to strong hydrogen bonding and polarity. The molecule `OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O` has even more hydroxyl groups and a highly branched structure, which would enhance these properties.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given its structural similarity to highly polar, polyhydroxylated molecules in the examples, the predicted value is likely **higher than 4.25827491**. A reasonable estimate would be:  
**5.0 to 6.0** (closer to the upper range observed in the examples, e.g., `NC(=O)NCc1ccccc1` or `Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2` with values ~5.0). 

For specificity, I predict:  
**5.5** (interpolating between the highest values in the dataset). 

---
### Key Reasoning:
1. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The molecule has **8 -OH groups**, far more than `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (4 -OH, value = 4.258), suggesting a stronger effect.
2. **Branched Structure**: The branching (e.g., `OC2OC(...)C(O)C2O`) increases solvent-accessible polar surface area, further boosting polarity.
3. **Ether Linkages**: While ethers are less polar than -OH, they don’t detract significantly (neutral or slight positive contribution).
4. **Lack of Negative Contributors**: No nonpolar chains (e.g., `CCCC`), halogens, or aromatic systems to reduce the value.

Thus, the value should exceed the highest polyhydroxylated example in the dataset (~4.26) and approach the upper limit implied by other high-value molecules (e.g., ~5.09 for `Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2`). 

---
**Final Answer**: **5.5** (estimated).

Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe several patterns in the property values:

1. **Hydrocarbons** (molecules containing only C and H) generally have property values of **0.0** unless they contain functional groups or specific structural features that influence the property. Examples:
   - `Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1` (toluene derivative) → 0.0  
   - `Fc1cccc(F)c1` (difluorobenzene) → 0.0  
   - `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32` (polycyclic aromatic) → 0.0  

2. **Alkynes** (C≡C) are present in some molecules, but their influence is context-dependent. For example:
   - `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (dicyanobenzene) has a value of -0.30045966, but this is likely due to the strongly polar nitrile groups (-C≡N), not the alkyne itself.  

3. **Simple hydrocarbons with no functional groups** (e.g., `CCC#C`, which is 1-butyne) are not explicitly listed in the examples, but analogous cases (e.g., `CCCC(=O)C` or `CCCCCC=O`) have negative values only when polar functional groups (like carbonyls) are present.  

4. **No functional groups or heteroatoms**: The molecule `CCC#C` is a simple alkyne with no polar or functionalized groups. Based on the trend for pure hydrocarbons (e.g., `Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1` → 0.0, `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32` → 0.0), the predicted property value should be:  

### Predicted property value for `CCC#C`: **0.0**  

This aligns with the observation that non-functionalized hydrocarbons (even with unsaturation like alkynes or aromatics) default to 0.0 unless other polar/ionic features are present.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: -0.7927810061724149
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question (**CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**), here's the reasoning for the predicted property value:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Phosphorus/Sulfur-Containing Groups**:  
   - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a value of **-0.67449076**.  
   - **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** has a value of **1.6501177**.  
   - The presence of **P(=S)** or similar groups tends to push the value toward moderate negative or positive values, depending on other substituents.

2. **Chlorinated Aromatic Rings**:  
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** and similar fully chlorinated aromatics have a value of **0.0**.  
   - Partial chlorination (e.g., **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl**) also often results in **0.0**, unless paired with strongly polar groups (e.g., **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** = **-0.85753947**).

3. **Ether/Alkoxy Groups (e.g., OCC)**:  
   - **CCCCOCCCC** has a value of **-0.50355759**.  
   - Ethers tend to introduce slight negative contributions unless counterbalanced by other features.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:  
**CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**  
- Contains **P(=S)**, which is a significant functional group (like in the first example above, contributing to a negative value).  
- Has a **triply chlorinated aromatic ring** (similar to many examples with **0.0**), but the **P(=S)OCC** group is strongly polar.  
- The **ethoxy group (CCOP)** is less impactful than the **P(=S)** core.  

### Comparison to Closest Examples:  
1. **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** = **-0.67449076**  
   - This has a similar **P(=S)** group and chlorinated aromatic ring, but with an additional polar amide/carbonyl.  
   - Our molecule lacks the amide but has a similar P(=S) and Cl-substituted ring.  

2. **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** = **-0.85753947**  
   - This has no phosphorus but shows how chlorinated + polar (O) groups combine for a negative value.  

### Prediction:  
The **P(=S)** group dominates, and the chlorinated ring does not fully cancel its polarity. The value should be **moderately negative**, close to the first example but slightly less negative due to fewer polar groups.  

**Predicted property value: -0.65**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend that P(=S) + Cl-aromatic ≈ **-0.6 to -0.7**, similar to the first example.)  

---  
**Final answer: -0.65** (approximate, likely between -0.6 and -0.7)

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 1.3183582360521138
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons or halogenated hydrocarbons** (e.g., `C=C`, `ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`, `CC(C)C`, `Clc1ccccc1Cl`) typically have a property value of **0.0**. These lack polar or functional groups that might influence the property.
2. **Molecules with aromatic rings and simple substituents** (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1Cl`, `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2`) often have values around **0.0** unless they contain specific functional groups.
3. **Molecules with polar or hydrogen-bonding groups** (e.g., `-NH2`, `-OH`, `-NO2`, `-C=O`, `-CONH-`) tend to have non-zero values, often negative. Examples:
   - `Nc1ccccc1Cl`: -0.87000208 (amine + chloro)
   - `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`: -0.82420924 (amide + chloro)
   - `Cc1ccc(O)cc1C`: -0.82375223 (phenolic -OH)
4. **Molecules with multiple or highly polar groups** (e.g., `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2`: 6.04630299) can have large positive or negative values.
5. **The presence of `C(=O)NN` (hydrazide group)** is notable in the target molecule. This is a polar, hydrogen-bonding group similar to amides or other carbonyl derivatives, which often correlate with negative property values (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`: -0.82420924).

### Target Molecule: `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`
- This is a pyridine ring (`c1nccc...c1`) with a `C(=O)NN` (hydrazide) substituent.
- The hydrazide group is highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding, similar to amides or other carbonyl derivatives in the examples.
- The pyridine ring is aromatic but less electron-rich than benzene, which might slightly reduce the impact of the substituent compared to benzene derivatives.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `Nc1ccccc1Cl` (amine + chloro on benzene): -0.87000208
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (amide + chloro on benzene): -0.82420924
- `Cc1ccc(O)cc1C` (phenolic -OH): -0.82375223
- `C2c1ccccc1N(CCF)C(=O)c3ccccc23` (amide + aromatic): -0.82496589

The hydrazide group (`C(=O)NN`) is even more polar than a simple amide due to the additional nitrogen, but the pyridine ring might slightly offset this. Given the examples, a value close to **-0.82 to -0.87** is reasonable.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.8242** (similar to other aromatic molecules with polar carbonyl-derived substituents). 

This aligns with the trend observed for molecules like `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (-0.82420924) and `C2c1ccccc1N(CCF)C(=O)c3ccccc23` (-0.82496589).

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns in the property values:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Zero Property (0.0):**
   - Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., **CC1=CCCCC1**, **CCCCCCCI**, **CCCc1ccccc1**).
   - Halogenated aromatics without polar groups (e.g., **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c2Cl**).
   - Non-polar or weakly polar molecules (e.g., **CCBr**, **CC=C**).

2. **Negative Property (≈ -0.5 to -0.8):**
   - Molecules with polar functional groups like **amides**, **esters**, **nitro groups**, or **hydrogen bond acceptors/donors** (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C**, **O=N(=O)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1**, **Oc1ccncc1**).

3. **Positive Property (≈ 1.5 to 10.5):**
   - Molecules with multiple **hydroxy groups** (e.g., **OC1C(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** → 10.5) or **nitro groups** (e.g., **Cc1ccc(cc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** → 3.65).

4. **Phosphorus-Containing Groups:**
   - **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** has a property of **1.62428388**, likely due to the **P(=S)** group combined with a nitro group.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C** contains:
- A **P(=S)** group (similar to the example with **P(=S)** and a positive property).
- An **amide group (C(=O)N)** (typically associated with negative property values).
- No strongly polar or ionizable groups (like multiple OH or NO₂).

The **P(=S)** group is likely the dominant contributor, but the amide and lack of additional polar groups may moderate its effect. The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1 (1.624)**, but our molecule lacks the nitro group and has an amide instead.

### Prediction:
Given the **P(=S)** group's influence and the amide's moderating effect, the property value is likely **positive but smaller** than the example with **P(=S)** and **NO₂**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.8** (between the P(=S) example and neutral molecules). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. If the property is, for example, a solubility or dipole-related metric, the reasoning would adjust accordingly.)

Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Simple alkanes (hydrocarbons with only single bonds and no functional groups) consistently have a property value of 0.0:
   - ClCCBr: 0.0
   - C/C1CCCCC1\C: 0.0
   - CCCCCCCO: 0.0 (note this has an OH group, but the pure hydrocarbon part would be 0.0)
   - CCCCC/C=C/C: 0.0
   - CCCCCC1CCCC1: 0.0
   - c1ccsc1: 0.0 (this is a simple heterocycle with no polar groups)
   - c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2: -0.82375223 (but the pure hydrocarbon parts would be 0.0)

2. The molecule in question, CCCCCCCC (octane), is a simple straight-chain alkane with no functional groups.

3. All other molecules that deviate from 0.0 have some polar functional groups (OH, Cl, NO2, etc.) or complex ring systems that likely contribute to whatever property is being measured (which appears to be some measure of polarity or hydrogen bonding capability).

Therefore, since octane (CCCCCCCC) is a pure hydrocarbon with no functional groups, its predicted property value would be:

0.0

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 0.35677902670150197
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as rings, double bonds, carbonyl groups, hydroxyl groups, and other polar or conjugated systems. 

Let's analyze the given molecule:  
**CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**

### Key structural features:
1. **Multiple rings (steroid-like framework)**: The molecule has a fused polycyclic structure, similar to some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` with a value of 0.1210572 or `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` with -0.71789063).
2. **Carbonyl group (C=O)**: This is a polar group that often increases the property value (e.g., `CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCC3CCC2C3` has a value of 2.1465028).
3. **Hydroxyl groups (-OH)**: These are present at two positions (attached to rings), which can contribute to higher values (e.g., `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has a very high value of 8.02279971).
4. **Alkyne group (C#C)**: This is a less common feature in the examples, but it may contribute slightly due to its unsaturation.
5. **Overall complexity**: The molecule is highly complex with multiple fused rings and functional groups, similar to some of the higher-valued examples.

### Comparison with similar examples:
- The molecule most closely resembles steroid-like structures with carbonyl and hydroxyl groups. For instance:
  - `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` has a value of **0.1210572**.
  - `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` has a value of **-0.71789063**.
  - `CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO` has a value of **5.03761363** (this has more polar groups and higher complexity).

Given the presence of two hydroxyl groups, a carbonyl group, and significant ring fusion, the property value is likely higher than the first two examples but not as extreme as the last one (which has additional polar groups like -F and -CO). 

### Predicted value:
A reasonable estimate would be **1.5 to 2.5**, leaning toward the higher end due to the alkyne group and multiple polar features. 

**Final predicted property value: 2.0** (approximating based on similar structures). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., solubility, logP, biological activity—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the examples.)

True Property: 21.89640128020091
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property being predicted appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and the presence of specific functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl groups, carbonyl groups, halogens, nitro groups, etc.). The property values range from negative (likely indicating some degree of polarity or hydrogen bonding) to positive (likely indicating more complex interactions or specific functional groups like nitro or sulfonamide).

Let's analyze the given molecule:
```
COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
```
Key features of this molecule:
1. Multiple ether (O-alkyl) and hydroxyl (OH) groups, which contribute to hydrogen bonding and polarity.
2. A carbonyl group (C=O), which adds polarity.
3. A complex fused ring system with multiple oxygen-containing heterocycles (e.g., OCO, COC), which further enhance polarity and hydrogen bonding potential.
4. No strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro or sulfonamide) that would push the property value into the higher positive range.

Comparison with similar molecules in the examples:
- Molecules with multiple hydroxyl/ether groups (e.g., `Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1`, `OCc1ccccc1`) have property values around `-0.82375223`.
- More complex polyols or sugars (e.g., `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21`) have slightly less negative values (`-0.67699254`), likely due to reduced accessibility of all OH groups.
- The presence of a carbonyl (C=O) might slightly increase the value (less negative), as seen in `CCCCCCC(=O)C` (`-0.76293362`).

Given the complexity and high oxygen content of this molecule, the property value is likely in the moderately negative range, similar to polyols or sugars but adjusted for the carbonyl and fused ring system.

Predicted property value: `-0.70` (approximate, based on the trends in the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data. The value is likely between `-0.68` and `-0.76`.)

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.8237522337520979
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities:

### Observations:
1. **Phenol derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., NO₂, Cl, Br, I)**:
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**: Property = 0.85853387  
     (Phenol with nitro group at para position)
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**: Property = 0.85853387  
     (Same as above, confirming consistency)
   - **Clc1ccccc1I**: Property = 0.0  
     (Chloro- and iodo-substituted benzene, no OH group)
   - **Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I**: Property = -0.47511129  
     (Phenol with strong electron-withdrawing groups: I and C#N)

2. **Phenol with halogen substituents**:
   - **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is structurally similar to **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** but with a **Cl** instead of **NO₂**. Chlorine is less electron-withdrawing than NO₂ but still has a moderate effect.

3. **Other halogenated phenols**:
   - **Fc1ccccc1**: Property = 0.0  
     (Fluorobenzene, no OH group)
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl**: Property = 0.0  
     (Biphenyl with Cl, no OH group)

4. **Phenol itself (no substituents)** is not in the examples, but substituents like NO₂ increase the property value, while halogens (Cl, I) seem to reduce it slightly compared to NO₂.

### Prediction:
- The property for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol) should be **lower than 0.85853387** (nitrophenol) but **higher than 0.0** (non-phenol halogenated aromatics). 
- From the examples, **Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I** has a property of -0.47511129, but Cl is less electron-withdrawing than I or C#N, so the value should be less negative or positive.
- Given the consistency in nitrophenol values, a reasonable estimate for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is **~0.5**, but looking for exact matches or closer analogs suggests it might be closer to **0.0** if the effect of Cl is similar to other halogenated aromatics.

However, **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is 0.85853387, and replacing NO₂ with Cl (less electron-withdrawing) would likely reduce the value. A plausible interpolation gives **~0.4 to 0.6**. 

But in the absence of exact matches, the most conservative estimate is **0.0**, as many halogenated aromatics without strong additional effects (like NO₂) default to 0.0. 

However, since phenol itself is not listed, and Cl is somewhat electron-withdrawing, a slight positive value is possible. Given the examples, the closest analog is **Oc1c(I)cc(C#N)cc1I** (-0.475), but Cl is less extreme, so perhaps **0.0** or slightly positive.

Given the uncertainty, the safest bet is **0.0**, as many simple halogenated phenols without additional strong effects default to this in the dataset.

### Final Answer:
**0.0**

Iteration: 87
SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -0.6880512932270161
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, we can deduce the following:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCC, c1ccccc1, C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2)** consistently have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain functional groups that significantly alter polarity or reactivity.
2. **Halogenated aromatic compounds (e.g., Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, Brc1ccccc1)** also tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless paired with other functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, amines).
3. **Molecules with polar or reactive functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, amines, alcohols, esters)** deviate from 0.0. For example:
   - **CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1** (amide) has a value of **-0.8602385**.
   - **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (polyol) has a very high value of **10.50188668**.
   - **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O** (complex polar structure) has **-0.82496589**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1** contains:
- A **chloroalkyne (ClCC#C)** – likely neutral (similar to simple halocarbons).
- An **ester linkage (OC(=O)N)** – polar and reactive.
- A **chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)** – typically neutral unless combined with other groups.
- An **amide-like group (Nc1cccc(Cl)c1)** – polar.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- **COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC** (diester) has a value of **0.0**, but this lacks the amide-like nitrogen.
- **CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1** (amide + ether) has **-0.68805129**.
- **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2** (chlorinated + amide-like) has **-0.38190891**.

Given the presence of the **polar amide-like group (N-C=O)** and the **chlorinated aromatic system**, the value is likely negative but not extremely large (similar to other amide-containing examples). The alkyne and ether portions may slightly offset the polarity.

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **-0.65**, based on the closest analogs (e.g., **-0.68805129** for CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1 and **-0.38190891** for Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2).

**Final answer: -0.65** (approximate, based on structural similarity to training examples).

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: -0.38141315772510936
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a central carbon attached to:
   - A hydroxyl group (**OH**),
   - A chlorophenyl ring (**c1ccc(Cl)cc1**),
   - A pyrimidine-like heterocycle (**c2cncnc2**, resembling a pyrimidine or similar N-containing ring),
   - Another chlorophenyl ring (**c3ccccc3Cl**).

2. **Key Functional Groups**:
   - **Hydroxyl (OH)**: Present in some examples (e.g., `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` with -0.617, `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` with +4.258). The property seems highly dependent on context (e.g., polyols have high values, single OH on aromatic rings tend to be negative).
   - **Chlorophenyl rings**: Chlorinated aromatics (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`, `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`) consistently have a property value of **0.0** unless combined with other strongly contributing groups.
   - **Heterocycle (c2cncnc2)**: N-containing heterocycles often increase the property (e.g., `Nc1nc[nH]n1` has +1.275, `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2` has +1.733). This suggests a positive contribution.

3. **Similar Examples**:
   - `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` has a value of **0.705**, featuring a heterocycle, Cl-substituted phenyl, and carbonyl groups.
   - `N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (diphenylamine) has -0.614, but replacing one phenyl with a heterocycle (as here) would likely increase the value.
   - The pyrimidine-like ring here is more electron-deficient than simple phenyl, likely increasing the property further.

### Prediction:
- The hydroxyl group on a non-polyol scaffold may contribute slightly negatively.
- The two chlorophenyl rings alone would contribute **0.0**, but their attachment to a central carbon with a heterocycle likely increases the value.
- The **c2cncnc2** heterocycle is a strong positive contributor (similar to other N-heterocycles with values ~1.3–1.8).

Given these observations, the property is likely **positive but modest**, similar to `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` (0.705) but slightly higher due to the additional heterocycle. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.85**  

This aligns with:
- Heterocycle contribution (~+1.3),
- Chlorophenyl rings (~0.0),
- OH group slight negative offset.  

Thus, **0.85** is a plausible prediction.
==================================================
Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.8701007040657227
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns for the property in question:

1. **Alkanes, simple aromatic hydrocarbons, and halogenated compounds (without other functional groups)** tend to have a property value of **0.0** (e.g., `CCCCBr`, `Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C`, `ClC=C(Cl)Cl`, `Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br`).

2. **Nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`)** significantly increase the property value, especially when present in aromatic systems (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of 1.7847494, and `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` has 2.91994533).

3. **Carbonyl groups (`C=O` or `C(=O)`)** in non-aromatic systems tend to give **negative values** (e.g., `CCCC(=O)OCC` has -0.8701007, `CCCCCC=O` has -0.76293362).

4. **Esters (`COC=O` or similar)** also tend to give negative values (e.g., `CC(=O)OCC` is part of larger structures with negative contributions).

5. **Ethers (`COC`)** without other strongly contributing functional groups do not seem to significantly alter the property from 0.0 unless combined with other groups.

The molecule in question is **`CCCCOC=O`**, which is an aliphatic aldehyde (`C=O`) with an ether linkage (`COC`). 

From the examples:
- `CCCC(=O)OCC` (an ester) has a value of **-0.8701007**.
- `CCCCCC=O` (an aliphatic aldehyde) has a value of **-0.76293362**.
- Ethers alone (e.g., `CCOc1ccc(NC(N)=O)cc1`) have values influenced by other groups, but `COC` alone does not seem to contribute strongly.

Since `CCCCOC=O` is structurally similar to `CCCCCC=O` (both are aliphatic aldehydes), but with an ether linkage replacing two carbons, we can expect a similar negative value. The ether linkage may slightly modulate the value, but the dominant contribution is from the aldehyde.

Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for `CCCCOC=O` is:  
**-0.76** (similar to `CCCCCC=O`). 

However, since the ether linkage might slightly reduce the magnitude (as seen in esters being more negative than aldehydes), a more precise estimate would be between -0.76 and -0.87. 

Averaging the two closest analogs (`CCCCCC=O` at -0.76293362 and `CCCC(=O)OCC` at -0.8701007), we might predict:  
**-0.816** (rounded to -0.82 for simplicity). 

But given the examples, **-0.76** is more directly comparable. 

Final predicted value: **-0.76**. 

However, looking back, `CCCC(=O)OCC` (ester) is -0.8701007, and `CCCCCC=O` (aldehyde) is -0.76293362. `CCCCOC=O` is an aldehyde with an ether, so likely closer to the aldehyde value. 

Thus, the most accurate prediction based on the data is:  
**-0.76293362** (same as `CCCCCC=O`). 

But since the ether might slightly reduce it, we could say **-0.75** to account for the ether. 

Given the options, I’ll stick with **-0.76** as the closest match. 

**Predicted property value for CCCCOC=O: -0.76**
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can observe the following patterns for the property values:

1. Simple halogenated alkanes (e.g., ClCCCl, Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, CCBr, ClC(Cl)(Cl)C...) tend to have a property value of **0.0** when they don't contain other functional groups or complex structural features.

2. The molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) is a simple dihalogenated methane, structurally similar to **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) and other halogenated compounds that have a property value of 0.0 in the examples.

3. There are no complicating functional groups (like -OH, -NH2, -C=O, etc.) or aromatic systems in **ClCCl** that would cause the property value to deviate from 0.0.

Thus, the predicted property value for **ClCCl** is:

**0.0**

Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.8237522337520979
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - Molecules with a phenol group (OH attached to a benzene ring) often have property values around **-0.6 to -0.8**. 
   - Examples:
     - `Oc1cccc(O)c1` → **-0.6178778**
     - `c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC` → **-0.6178778**
     - `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` → **-0.82375223**

2. **Methyl Substitution**: 
   - Adding methyl groups (CH3) to the phenol ring tends to slightly decrease the property value (more negative). 
   - Example: 
     - `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (two methyl groups) → **-0.82375223**

3. **Mono-Substituted Phenols**: 
   - Phenols with one substituent (e.g., methyl) tend to have values closer to **-0.6 to -0.7**.
   - Example: 
     - `Cc1ccc(C)cc1O` (similar to our target molecule but with an extra methyl) → **-0.82375223**

### Target Molecule: **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**
- This is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (specifically, 2,4-dimethylphenol, where methyl groups are at positions 2 and 4 of the benzene ring).
- Compared to `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (which has two methyl groups and a value of **-0.82375223**), our molecule has one fewer methyl group.
- The presence of two methyl groups (one ortho and one para to the OH) suggests a value slightly less negative than **-0.82375223** but more negative than simple phenol (**-0.6178778**).

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is:  
**-0.75** (approximate interpolation between -0.617 and -0.823).

However, looking closely at the examples, the closest match is `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O` (**-0.82375223**), but our molecule has one fewer methyl group. Thus, the value should be slightly higher (less negative). 

A more precise estimate would be:  
**-0.72** (intermediate between -0.617 and -0.823).

But since the examples show phenol derivatives with similar substitutions clustering around **-0.6 to -0.8**, and the molecule is very similar to `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O`, the exact value is likely closer to **-0.80**.

After reconsidering, the most consistent value for this type of structure in the given examples is:  
**-0.82375223** (same as `CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O`).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is:  
**-0.82375223**
==================================================
Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to be **0.0** for molecules that are highly halogenated (especially with chlorine or bromine) or have symmetric, non-polar, or aromatic structures without strongly polar or ionizable functional groups. 

The given molecule, **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**, is a polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure with multiple chlorine substitutions and no strongly polar or ionizable groups (like -NO2, -OH, -NH2, -COOH, etc.). Similar examples in the dataset (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl, Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c2ccccc2)c(Cl)c1Cl) also have a property value of **0.0**.

Thus, the predicted property value for this molecule is:  
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I can observe the following patterns regarding the property values:

1. Simple hydrocarbons (only C and H) with no functional groups or unsaturation (other than single C=C bonds) tend to have property values of 0.0. Examples:
   - c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32 (0.0)
   - CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (0.0)
   - c1ccc2c3c(ccc2c1)c4cccc5cccc3c45 (0.0)
   - Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (0.0)
   - Cc1ccccc1C (0.0)
   - CCCCCCCC (0.0)

2. Molecules with just a single C=C bond in an otherwise saturated hydrocarbon also tend to have 0.0:
   - CCCCCCCCC=C (0.0)

3. The molecule CC=C(C)C is an isobutene derivative with just a single C=C bond in an otherwise saturated hydrocarbon structure, similar to the examples above that have property values of 0.0.

4. The only exception to this pattern is CCCC(C=O)CC which has a value of -0.76293362, but this contains a carbonyl group (C=O) which is a functional group that affects the property.

Since CC=C(C)C contains no functional groups and only a simple C=C bond in a hydrocarbon structure, following the predominant pattern in the examples, I would predict its property value to be:

0.0
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structure. Here are some key observations:

1. **Simple alkanes and hydrocarbons** (e.g., `CCCC1CCCC1`, `C=CCCC=C`, `c1ccc2c3c(ccc2c1)c4cccc5cccc3c45`) tend to have a property value of **0.0**. These molecules lack functional groups or electronegative atoms.

2. **Molecules with halogens (Cl, F, Br, I)** or **oxygen-containing groups (OH, O, CO, etc.)** often have negative property values, typically around **-0.82 to -0.86**. For example:
   - `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` → -0.82375223
   - `CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1` → -0.8602385
   - `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` → 0.0 (but this is a highly symmetric, nonpolar halogenated aromatic, which explains the 0.0).

3. **Molecules with nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`)** or **sulfur-containing groups (e.g., `S(=O)(=O)`)** often have **positive property values**, sometimes significantly higher (e.g., 2.9 to 6.6).

4. **Small, simple halogenated alkanes** (e.g., `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` → 0.0) tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless they have additional functional groups.

### Prediction for `ClCCl` (dichloromethane-like structure):
- This is a simple, small molecule with two chlorines but no other functional groups. It is analogous to `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene), which has a property value of **0.0**.
- There are no oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur atoms to contribute to a negative or positive property value.
- The symmetry and lack of polarizability beyond the Cl-C bonds suggest it will behave similarly to other simple halogenated alkanes.

Thus, the predicted property value for `ClCCl` is:  
**0.0**

Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.8237522337520979
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** can be predicted by comparing it to similar structures in the dataset. 

### Observations:
1. The molecule is a **chlorinated phenol derivative** (specifically, 2,4,6-trichlorophenol). 
2. It has a similar structure to the following example from the dataset:
   - **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (property value: **-0.82375223**).

The only difference between the given molecule and the example is the position of one chlorine atom (the example has 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, while the given molecule is 2,4,6-trichlorophenol). Since the substitution pattern is very similar (three chlorines and a phenol group), the electronic and steric effects are nearly identical. 

### Predicted Property Value:
The property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is likely the same as the closely related example:  
**-0.82375223**  

This matches the trend where heavily chlorinated aromatic systems with polar groups (like -OH) tend to have property values around **-0.82** in this dataset.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 21.89640128020091
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and polarity. The molecule in question is highly complex with multiple functional groups (ethers, alcohols, carbonyls, and cyclic structures), which suggests a high property value. 

Here’s the breakdown:
1. The molecule has multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, alcohols, carbonyls), which often contribute positively to the property value (e.g., polyols like `OCC(O)CO` have values like 0.617, and more complex sugars like `OCC1OC(...)C1O` have very high values like 32.646).
2. It contains fused ring systems and cyclic ethers, which add to the complexity.
3. The presence of glycosidic linkages (e.g., `OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O`) is reminiscent of carbohydrate-like structures, which in the examples have very high values (e.g., 32.646 for a large sugar molecule).

Comparing to the examples:
- Simpler polyols or sugars with fewer functional groups have values in the 0.6–32 range.
- This molecule is more complex than most in the list but shares features with the highest-value examples (e.g., multiple hydroxyls, cyclic ethers, and carbonyls).

Given this, the predicted property value is likely in the higher range observed in the examples. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: 25.0**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural similarity to high-value examples like `OCC1OC(...)C1O` (32.646) but adjusted for slightly less oxygen density. Without a clear quantitative pattern, precise prediction is challenging.)

Iteration: 97
SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 1.9681139781593882
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** with a **thiomethyl group (S-CH3)** and a **tetramethyl-substituted urea-like fragment (C(=O)N-C(C)(C)C)**. 
   - The presence of **S-CH3** and **C(=O)N** groups suggests some polarity but not extreme hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity.
   - The **tetramethyl substitution (C(C)(C)C)** adds steric bulk, which may reduce solubility or interaction potential.

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1** (property = 1.73070513): This is a similar pyrimidone-like structure with polar groups (NH, C=O) and a methyl substitution. The property is positive and moderately high.
   - **Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property = 1.73299357): This is a purine-like structure with multiple nitrogens and an OH group, also yielding a positive property.
   - **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property = 1.48403261): This has a thioether (S), a C(=O)N, and bulky substitutions, similar to our target molecule. The property is positive but slightly lower than the others.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Molecules with **polar groups (C=O, NH, S)** and **bulky substitutions** tend to have **positive property values** in the range of **1.4 to 1.7**.
   - The presence of **S-CH3** and **C(=O)N** in our molecule is analogous to some of these cases.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to the examples above, particularly **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** (property = 1.48403261), and accounting for the slightly less polar nature of our molecule (no OH group), the predicted property value would likely be in the **same range but slightly lower**.

**Final Prediction**: **1.45** (approximate, based on structural analogy). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., solubility, logP, bioactivity—this is an educated guess based on the given examples.)

To predict the property for the molecule **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Simple Hydrocarbons (e.g., CC, CCCC, CCC(C)(C)C)**: These have a property value of **0.0**, indicating minimal or no contribution to the property.
2. **Aromatic Rings (e.g., c1ccccc1, c1ccc2ccccc12)**: When unsubstituted or with simple substituents (e.g., alkyl groups), these also tend to have a property value of **0.0**.
3. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Carbonyl (C=O)**: The presence of a carbonyl group (especially in esters or ketones) often reduces the property value slightly (e.g., **CCCC(=O)OCC** has **-0.8701007**).
   - **Ester (COO)**: Esters like **CCOC(=O)** tend to have negative property values (e.g., **CCCC(=O)OC** has **-0.8701007**).
   - **Hydroxy (OH)**: Hydroxy groups, especially multiple ones, significantly increase the property value (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** has **10.50188668**).
   - **Amides (NC=O)**: These often increase the property value (e.g., **NC(=O)NC1NC(=O)NC1=O** has **8.65558353**).
4. **Aromatic Esters**: 
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C** has **2.1465028** (amide + ester).
   - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2** has **12.08690136** (complex aromatic ester with additional polar groups).
   - The simplest aromatic ester in the examples is **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**, but it is not explicitly listed. However, similar molecules like **CCCC(=O)OC** (aliphatic ester) have **-0.8701007**.

### Prediction for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**:
This is an ethyl ester of benzoic acid (ethyl benzoate). It has:
- An aromatic ring (contributing **0.0** if unsubstituted, but here it's substituted with an ester).
- An ester group (**CCOC(=O)**), which is similar to **CCCC(=O)OC** (property **-0.8701007**).

Given that the ester group is attached to an aromatic ring, the property value is likely slightly less negative than aliphatic esters because aromatic systems can delocalize the carbonyl's polarity. From the examples:
- **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (aromatic diketone) has **-0.79278101**.
- **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenyl ether) has **-0.50355759**.

Thus, the property for **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** should be in the range of **-0.5 to -0.8**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.75** (approximate, based on trends). 

However, looking more closely, **CCCC(=O)OC** (aliphatic ester) is **-0.8701007**, and **CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (aromatic diketone) is **-0.79278101**. Since **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** is an aromatic monoester, its value is likely closer to **-0.8**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.8** (rounded to one decimal place based on the closest examples). 

(Note: Without an exact match in the examples, this is an educated interpolation. The true value might be slightly different, but **-0.8** is a reasonable prediction.)
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain patterns in the property values:

1. Simple aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., CSSC, C=CCS(=O)SCC=C, CCCC(=O)CCC) tend to have property values around 0.0 or -0.76293362.
2. Brominated compounds (e.g., Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O) tend to have property values of 0.0 or small positive values (0.15596325 in one case).
3. The molecule CCCC(=O)CCC has a property value of -0.76293362, and similar molecules like CCCCCCC(=O)C also have the same value.
4. The molecule CCCCCCCCO has a property value of -0.82375223, which is slightly more negative than the -0.76293362 pattern.

The molecule in question, CCCCCCCBr, is a simple aliphatic hydrocarbon with a bromine substituent. Comparing it to similar molecules:
- Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of 0.0
- CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O has a property value of 0.15596325
- Simple aliphatic chains tend to have values around 0.0 or -0.76293362

Given that CCCCCCCBr is more similar to Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (a brominated aromatic) than to the more complex CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, and considering that simple aliphatic bromides without other functional groups tend to have property values of 0.0, the most likely prediction is:

Predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr: 0.0
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.8237522337520979
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and polarity. Here are some observations:

1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCC`, `CC1=CCCCC1`, `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32`) have a property value of `0.0`**. These molecules lack polar or reactive functional groups.
2. **Molecules with polar groups (e.g., `-OH`, `-NO2`, `-C=O`, `-NH2`) tend to have non-zero values**, with higher values for more polar or conjugated systems (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)C(=O)N1` has a high value of `4.61610582` due to multiple carbonyls and amides).
3. **Small polar molecules like `CO` (methanol) or `CCC(C)CO` (butanol) have negative values around `-0.82375223`**, suggesting that simple alcohols fall into this range.

The molecule `CO` (methanol) is a small, polar alcohol with no additional complexity. Based on the examples:
- `CCC(C)CO` (butanol) has a value of `-0.82375223`.
- `OC1CCCCCC1` (cyclohexanol) has a value of `-0.82375223`.
- `CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O` (a substituted cyclohexanol) also has `-0.82375223`.

Thus, **the predicted property value for `CO` (methanol) is likely `-0.82375223`**, consistent with other simple alcohols in the dataset. 

### Final answer:  
**-0.82375223**
