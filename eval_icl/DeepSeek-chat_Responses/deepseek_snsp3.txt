Iteration: 1
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -1.214764992641568
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I can identify some patterns in the property values:

1. Simple alkanes (e.g., CCC, CCCCCC) and their derivatives with single functional groups (e.g., CCCC(C)O) tend to have property values of 0.0.

2. Molecules with aromatic rings and simple substituents often have values around 3.4 (e.g., c1ccccc1C(O)C(O)c2ccccc2, COC(=O)c1cccnc1).

3. Molecules with multiple halogens (especially chlorine) often have values around -0.0927.

4. Longer chain molecules with ester groups show negative values (e.g., CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC has -1.53269955).

The molecule in question is CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which is very similar to CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (value -1.53269955) but with two fewer carbons in the chain. 

Given that:
- Both are long-chain esters
- The chain length difference is modest (C10 vs C12)
- The property tends to become more negative with longer chains

I would predict the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC to be slightly less negative than -1.53269955, perhaps around -1.4.

However, looking more carefully at the examples, there seems to be a pattern where:
- CCOC(=O)CC has 3.64730687 (short chain ester)
- CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC has -1.53269955 (long chain ester)
- The transition appears to occur around C8-C10

Since our molecule is C10, which is between these, and considering the clear trend toward more negative values with longer chains, I'll predict a value slightly higher than -1.53269955.

Final predicted property value: -1.4

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Property = -0.09270983**: This value appears frequently for molecules with:
   - Aromatic rings with halogen substitutions (e.g., Cl, Br).
   - Heterocyclic structures with electronegative atoms (e.g., N, O, S).
   - Examples:
     - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (multiple Cl substitutions on aromatic rings).
     - `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1` (cyclic urea with carbonyl groups).
     - `c1cncnc1` (aromatic heterocycle with N).
     - `Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (pentachlorophenol).

2. **Property = 0.0**: Typically seen for simple aliphatic chains or alcohols without aromaticity or halogens (e.g., `CCC(O)CC`, `BrC(Cl)Cl`, `CO`).

3. **Higher positive values (e.g., ~3.4)**: Associated with aromatic amines (`CNc1ccccc1`, `Cc1ccccc1N`) or complex polyaromatic systems (`Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32`).

4. **Negative values other than -0.09270983**: Often involve carbonyl groups or extended conjugation with halogens (e.g., `CC(O)c1ccccc1` = -1.38, `C/C=C/C=O` = -1.38).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2** has the following features:
- A **benzofuran-2-one-like structure** with:
  - A chlorine substituent on the benzene ring (`Clc2ccc...`).
  - A lactam-like ring (`oc(=O)[nH]c1`), which is a heterocycle with a carbonyl (C=O) and NH group.
- This structure resembles cyclic amides/heterocycles with aromatic and electronegative substitutions, similar to molecules with the property **-0.09270983**.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1` (cyclic urea with carbonyls) = -0.09270983.
- `c1cncnc1` (aromatic heterocycle) = -0.09270983.
- `Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (polyhalogenated phenol) = -0.09270983.

The target molecule shares key traits with these examples:
1. Aromatic ring with halogen (Cl).
2. Heterocycle with C=O and NH.
3. No additional features that would suggest a deviation from the common value of **-0.09270983**.

### Predicted Property:
The property value for **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2** is **-0.09270983**.
==================================================
Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have positive property values when they are part of more complex structures (e.g., Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO has a value of 2.38869558).

2. Simple aliphatic nitro compounds (like CC(C)N(=O)=O) don't have exact matches in the examples, but similar simple compounds (e.g., CCCCCl, CCI, ClCC) all have property values of 0.0.

3. The nitro group in CC(C)N(=O)=O is attached to a simple isopropyl group, making it relatively simple compared to the aromatic nitro compounds that show higher values.

Given these observations and the fact that simple functionalized aliphatic compounds tend to have property values of 0.0 in the examples, the most reasonable prediction for CC(C)N(=O)=O would be:

**Predicted property value: 0.0**

Iteration: 4
SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 3.3597428914679424
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property of the given molecule:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Steroids and Polycyclic Structures with Carbonyl Groups**:
   - Molecules like `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` (a steroid-like structure with carbonyl groups) have relatively high property values (e.g., **3.35974289**).
   - The presence of multiple rings and carbonyl groups appears to increase the property value.

2. **Simple Aliphatic or Non-Functionalized Molecules**:
   - Molecules like `CC(C)Cl` or `CCCCCC` have a property value of **0.0**, suggesting minimal contribution from simple aliphatic chains or halogens alone.

3. **Aromatic Systems with Polar Groups**:
   - Aromatic systems with polar substituents (e.g., nitro groups, amines) often have higher values (e.g., `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` has **3.40264009**).
   - Pure aromatic systems without polar groups (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54`) tend to have low or negative values (e.g., **-0.09270983**).

4. **Carbonyl Groups in Flexible Chains**:
   - Molecules like `CC(=O)C(C)(C)C` or `CCCC(=O)CCC` have moderate values (**2.35770279** and **1.11974769**, respectively), suggesting carbonyls contribute but are less impactful than in rigid polycyclic systems.

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
The molecule is:
```
CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
```
- **Structure**: This is a **steroid-like polycyclic molecule** with:
  - Multiple fused rings (characteristic of steroids).
  - A **carbonyl group (`C=O`)** in the form of `C(=O)CO` (primary alcohol oxidized to a carboxylate-like group).
  - A **hydroxyl group (`OH`)** at one of the ring positions.
  - An **additional carbonyl (`C=O`)** in the ring system (`CC(=O)CCC`).

- **Similarity to Examples**:
  - Very similar to `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` (property = **3.35974289**), but with additional polar groups (`OH` and `C(=O)CO`).
  - The extra polar groups (especially the `C(=O)CO`) are likely to **increase the property value further** due to enhanced polarity and hydrogen bonding potential.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to the steroid example with a higher number of polar groups, the predicted property value is:  
**3.6 ± 0.1**  

A precise estimate would be **3.64730687** (matching the value for `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` but slightly higher due to the additional `OH` and `C(=O)CO`). However, since the examples show that additional polar groups can push the value higher (e.g., `COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C` has **3.66382155**), the final prediction is:  

**Predicted value: 3.65**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the assumption that it correlates with polarity, hydrogen bonding, or steric complexity, as suggested by the examples.)

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substitutions and one with a chlorine substitution), connected by a urea-like linker **C(=O)NC(=O)N**. 
   - Aromatic rings with halogen substitutions (e.g., Cl, F) often appear in the examples with property values around **-0.09270983** (e.g., Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1, Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, etc.).
   - The urea linker is polar and may introduce some complexity, but similar polar groups (e.g., amides, ureas) in the examples don't drastically change the property from the halogenated aromatic baseline.

2. **Halogen substitutions**: 
   - The presence of **F** and **Cl** substituents is common in examples with values around **-0.09270983** (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, Brc1ccc(Br)cc1, etc.).
   - No strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups (e.g., NO2, OH, NH2) are present to shift the value significantly.

3. **Comparison to similar molecules**:
   - **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (property: -0.09270983) is a halogenated biphenyl, similar in complexity.
   - **NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1** (property: -0.09270983) has a thiourea linker, analogous to the urea linker here.
   - **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (property: -0.09270983) has a diphenyl ether structure, also similar in complexity.

4. **No extreme features**:
   - The molecule lacks long aliphatic chains (which give 0.0 in examples like CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC).
   - It lacks strongly ionizable groups (e.g., COOH, SO3H) or conjugated systems that would push the value higher (e.g., polyaromatics like C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13 with value 2.8860815).

### Conclusion:
The molecule's structural features most closely align with examples where the property value is **-0.09270983**. The halogenated aromatic rings and polar linker are not sufficient to deviate from this baseline.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.09270983**

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl ethyl ether), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes, Ethers, and Alcohols with No Functional Groups or Simple Symmetry**:
   - Molecules like **CCCCCC(O)CC**, **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC**, **CCCCCC1CCCC1**, **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**, **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C**, **CC1CCCO1**, **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, **CCCC(C)CO**, **CCSCC**, **CCCC(C)(O)CC**, **CCCCCO**, **CCCCCCCCBr**, and **ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl** all have a property value of **0.0**. These are typically saturated hydrocarbons, simple ethers, or alcohols without aromatic rings or complex functional groups.

2. **Molecules with Aromatic Rings or Complex Functional Groups**:
   - These tend to have non-zero values (positive or negative), especially if they contain halogens, nitro groups, conjugated systems, or heterocycles.

3. **CCCOC(C)C**:
   - This is a simple ether (ethyl isopropyl ether) with no aromatic rings, halogens, or other functional groups beyond the ether linkage. It is structurally similar to the molecules in the first category (e.g., **CCCC(C)CO**, **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**), which all have a property value of **0.0**.

### Prediction:
Since **CCCOC(C)C** is a simple, non-aromatic ether with no additional functional groups, its predicted property value is:

**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 7
SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: -0.443758423955445
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, here's the reasoning for the predicted property value:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds (Cl/Br)**:
   - Many Cl/Br-substituted aromatics (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl`, `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`) have a property value of **-0.09270983**.
   - However, if the halogen is part of a more complex polar/functionalized system (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1`), the value can be much higher (**3.85648129**).

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O)**:
   - Molecules with carbonyl groups (e.g., esters, amides, ketones) tend to have higher or lower values depending on conjugation and substitution. For example:
     - `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` has **-0.41550918**.
     - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` has **3.85648129**.

3. **Heterocycles with Polar Groups**:
   - Molecules like `CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1` (polar heterocycle with Cl and N) have **-1.06049872**.
   - `COc2cnc1cncnc1n2` (polar heterocycle with O and N) has **3.40264009**.

4. **Bromine Substitution**:
   - Bromine in a non-aromatic or complex system (e.g., `CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O`) is not directly comparable to simple aromatic Br-substituted examples, but it likely increases polarity.

### Target Molecule: **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**
- **Structure**: A brominated uracil derivative (or similar heterocycle) with:
  - Two carbonyl groups (C=O).
  - A bromine substituent (Br).
  - An alkyl group (CCC(C)).
  - An NH group (polar).
- **Analogous Examples**:
  - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (amide + Br) has **3.85648129**.
  - `CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1` (polar heterocycle + Cl) has **-1.06049872**.
  - `COc2cnc1cncnc1n2` (polar heterocycle) has **3.40264009**.
- **Reasoning**:
  - The bromine and carbonyl groups increase polarity, but the alkyl group may offset this slightly.
  - The closest analog is `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (property **3.85648129**), but the heterocycle here may reduce the value slightly.
  - The presence of two carbonyls and Br suggests a higher value, likely in the **3.2–3.8 range**.

### Predicted Property Value:
**3.20079652**  
*(This matches the value seen for other polar heterocycles with halogens and carbonyls, e.g., `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O`).*

Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the structure of the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), we can infer the following:

1. **Patterns in the Data**:
   - **Aromatic systems with simple substitution or conjugation**: 
     - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (coronene, a large aromatic system) has a property value of **-0.09270983**.
     - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a polycyclic aromatic with nitrogen substitution) also has **-0.09270983**.
     - **c2(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1nccnc1c2(Cl)** (a chlorinated heteroaromatic) again has **-0.09270983**.
   - **Biphenyl-like structures**:
     - **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (methyl-substituted biphenyl) has a value of **2.41951122**.
     - **C1CCc2ccccc2C1** (a saturated ring attached to a benzene) has **3.22455317**.
     - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (a methyl-substituted polycyclic aromatic) has **3.20079652**.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - Simple aromatic systems (like biphenyl without substituents) tend to have values close to **-0.09270983** when they are unsubstituted or symmetrically conjugated.
   - Substitution (e.g., methyl groups) or additional rings can increase the value significantly (e.g., **2.41951122** or **3.22455317**).
   - The molecule in question (**biphenyl**) is a simple conjugated aromatic system with no substituents, similar to the cases with **-0.09270983**.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Since biphenyl is a simple conjugated aromatic system (like the other unsubstituted cases), its property value is likely **-0.09270983**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.09270983**
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe that the property values tend to be zero (0.0) for simple aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., `C1CCC2CCCCC2C1`, `CC(C)I`, `CCCCCC(C)C`, `CCC1CCCCC1`, `CCCC(C)(C)C`, `OC1CCCCCCC1`) unless they contain functional groups, unsaturation, or heteroatoms that introduce polarity or reactivity. 

The molecule in question, `CCCCS`, is a simple aliphatic thiol (butanethiol). While it contains a sulfur atom (a heteroatom), the examples show that sulfur-containing molecules can have varying property values depending on their structure and other functional groups. For instance:
- `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O` has a value of `-0.03107967`.
- `COCCCNc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(SC)n1` has a value of `3.01373065`.
- `Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1` has a value of `0.68041532`.

However, `CCCCS` is a simpler thiol without additional functional groups or complex features. The closest analog in the examples is `CC(C)I` (iodopropane), which has a value of `0.0`, suggesting that simple heteroatom-containing aliphatic chains may default to `0.0` unless other features are present. 

Given the lack of additional functional groups or unsaturation in `CCCCS`, I predict its property value to be:

**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular structure.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkanes/Alcohols with No Functional Groups or Simple Structures**:
   - **CCC(C)(C)C**: 0.0
   - **CC(C)CC(C)O**: 0.0
   - **CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O**: 0.0
   - **CCCC(C)(O)CC**: 0.0
   - **ClC(Cl)Cl**: 0.0
   - **CCBr**: 0.0
   - **BrC(Br)Br**: 0.0
   - **ClCC(Cl)Cl**: 0.0
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSCC**: 0.0
   - **CCCCOC**: 0.0

   These molecules are simple alkanes, alcohols, or halogenated alkanes with no significant functional groups or conjugation, and their property value is **0.0**.

2. **Molecules with Aromatic Rings or Conjugation**:
   - Aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) often have property values around **-0.09270983** unless they have additional functional groups that significantly alter the property (e.g., nitro groups, carbonyls, etc.).

3. **Molecules with Polar or Complex Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with carbonyls, nitro groups, or other polar/electron-withdrawing groups tend to have higher (positive or negative) property values (e.g., **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1**: 3.85648129).

4. **Molecules with Long Hydrocarbon Chains or Unsaturation**:
   - **CCCC/C=C/C**: 2.43485121 (trans double bond)
   - **CC/C=C\C**: -1.64332116 (cis double bond)
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC**: 2.35770279 (ester)

### Analysis of **CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
- This is a branched alcohol with a simple structure: **4-carbon chain with a tertiary butyl group and a terminal hydroxyl group**.
- Similar molecules in the examples (e.g., **CC(C)CC(C)O**, **CCCC(C)(O)CC**, **CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O**) all have a property value of **0.0**.
- The hydroxyl group is not conjugated or part of a complex functional group, and the rest of the molecule is a simple alkane.

### Conclusion:
The property value for **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is most likely **0.0**, consistent with other simple alkanes/alcohols in the dataset.

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.0**

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 3.8677595695072884
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - **c1ccccc1 (benzene)**: Property = -0.09270983
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1C (toluene derivative)**: Property = -0.06198445
   - **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1 (xylene derivative)**: Property = -0.06198445
   - **Cc1ccc(C)cc1 (toluene derivative)**: Property = -1.38003182
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1 (toluene derivative)**: Property = -0.06198445

   Aromatic rings with simple alkyl substitutions (methyl groups) tend to have property values around **-0.06 to -1.38**, depending on the substitution pattern.

2. **Fused Aromatic Systems**:
   - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (methyl-substituted naphthalene)**: Property = 3.20079652
   - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (methyl-substituted naphthalene)**: Property = 2.41951122
   - **CC34CCc1c(ccc2cc(O)ccc12)C3CCC4=O (complex fused system)**: Property = 2.77180428

   Fused aromatic systems (e.g., naphthalene derivatives) with methyl substitutions tend to have **positive property values (2.4 to 3.2)**.

3. **Target Molecule**: **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**
   - This is a **methyl-substituted naphthalene** (methyl group on one benzene ring of naphthalene).
   - Structurally similar to:
     - **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (property = 3.20079652)
     - **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (property = 2.41951122)
   - The methyl substitution is on a **non-fused ring** (similar to the second example above), so the property value is likely closer to **2.41951122**.

### Predicted Property:
Given the similarity to **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (property = 2.41951122)**, the predicted property for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** is approximately:

**2.41951122** (same as the closely related example).

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: -1.3948115824481417
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CC(C)C, CCCC, CC(C)CO, ClCCl)** typically have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain functional groups or conjugated systems.
2. **Aromatic rings with halogens (e.g., Clc1ccccc1, Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1)** consistently have a value of **-0.09270983**.
3. **Molecules with multiple carbonyl groups (C=O) and conjugated systems** tend to have higher positive values (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** has **2.10974558**).
4. **The presence of nitrogen in rings (e.g., imides, hydantoins)** combined with unsaturation (e.g., C=C) increases the property value.

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
The given molecule is structurally similar to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** (property = **2.10974558**), but with an additional **C(C)CCC** substituent. This substituent is a branched alkyl chain, which does not significantly alter the electronic properties of the core structure (a cyclic imide with a double bond). 

### Predicted Property:
Since the core structure (cyclic imide + C=C) is preserved and the additional alkyl group is not expected to drastically change the property, the value should be close to the reference molecule. 

**Predicted property: ~2.1**  
(Specifically, **2.10974558**, matching the reference imide structure).

Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), we can predict its property value by comparing it to structurally similar molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Key Observations from the Dataset**:
   - **Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCCC, C1CCCC1, CCCCCO)** have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain functional groups or unsaturation.
   - **Aromatic rings with halogens (e.g., Clc1ccc(I)cc1, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, Oc1ccc(Br)cc1)** consistently have a property value of **-0.09270983**.
   - The presence of **fluorine (F)** is not explicitly in the dataset, but halogens (Cl, Br, I) tend to assign the value **-0.09270983** when attached to an aromatic ring.
   - The **trifluoromethyl group (CF3)** is a strongly electron-withdrawing substituent, similar to other halogens in terms of electronic effects on the aromatic ring.

2. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - The closest analogs are halogenated benzenes like **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** and **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**, which have the value **-0.09270983**.
   - The **CF3** group is bulkier but similarly electron-withdrawing, so it likely falls into the same category.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Since halogenated aromatics consistently show **-0.09270983**, and **CF3** is a halogen-like substituent, the predicted value for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** is:

**Predicted property value: -0.09270983**
==================================================
Iteration: 14
SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules. Here are some observations:

1. **Highly polar or hydrophilic molecules (e.g., polyols, sugars, or molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups)** tend to have a property value close to **0.0**. Examples:
   - `CC(C)CCCO` → 0.0 (simple alcohol)
   - `CCC(C)(O)CC` → 0.0 (alcohol)
   - `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` → 0.0 (sugar-like polyol)
   - `CCCI` → 0.0 (non-polar, but halogenated)
   - `CC(C)C` → 0.0 (non-polar hydrocarbon)

2. **Aromatic systems with no strongly polar or ionizable groups** tend to have values around **-0.09270983** (e.g., benzene, naphthalene, or heterocycles without strong polarity).

3. **Molecules with ionizable groups (e.g., amines, nitro groups, or carboxylic acids)** or **strongly polar functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, sulfonamides)** deviate from 0.0, either positively or negatively.

The molecule in question is:
**OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**

This is a sugar-like polyol (similar to glucose or sorbitol) with multiple hydroxyl groups. Based on the examples:
- `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (a linear polyol) has a property value of **0.0**.
- `CCC(C)(O)CC` (a simple alcohol) also has **0.0**.

Thus, the predicted property value for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is:
**0.0** (due to its highly polar, polyol nature, similar to other examples with this structure).

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 1.4819685629834747
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key structural observations:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a polycyclic steroid-like structure with multiple rings (similar to some of the larger molecules in the examples, such as `CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCCCC2` or `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C`). These structures often have intermediate property values (e.g., 1.50167478 for the latter).
2. **Ketone groups (C=O)**: There are multiple carbonyl groups (C=O), which can contribute to polarity and reactivity. In the examples, molecules with ketones (e.g., `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`) tend to have higher property values (3.86775957).
3. **Ester linkage (CC(=O)OCC(=O))**: The presence of an ester group (similar to `CCOC(=O)C`, which has a high value of 3.74420298) suggests a higher property value.
4. **Hydroxyl groups (C(O))**: The molecule has hydroxyl groups, which can hydrogen bond. In the examples, hydroxylated molecules like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` have a value of 0.0, but this is likely due to symmetry or lack of other functional groups. Here, the hydroxyls are part of a more complex structure.
5. **Conjugated system (C=CC=O)**: The presence of a conjugated double bond with a carbonyl (C=CC=O) may increase the property value, as seen in molecules like `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (3.86775957).

### Comparison to similar examples:
- `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` has a value of **3.03675432**. This is a steroid-like molecule with a ketone and ester, similar to our target molecule but without the additional hydroxyl groups or conjugated double bond.
- `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` has a value of **1.50167478**. This is a simpler steroid-like molecule with one ketone and one hydroxyl.
- `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` has a value of **3.86775957**, which is higher due to the aromatic ring and conjugated ketone.

### Prediction:
Given the structural complexity, the presence of multiple polar groups (esters, ketones, hydroxyls), and the conjugated system, the property value is likely to be **higher than 3.03675432** but not as high as 3.86775957 (due to the lack of an aromatic ring). 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**3.4** (specific value: **3.40264009**, matching some other complex polar molecules in the examples). 

### Final answer:
**3.40264009**

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: -1.633360872319529
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain recurring numbers, particularly **-0.09270983**, **-0.03107967**, **0.0**, and some positive values like **3.54432998**, **3.74420298**, etc. 

Key observations:
1. **Highly halogenated (Cl, Br) or aromatic systems** often have the value **-0.09270983** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`, `Brc1ccccc1`, `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N`).
2. **Molecules with carbonyl groups (C=O) in certain contexts** (e.g., cyclic amides, ureas) often have **-0.03107967** (e.g., `CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O`, `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O`).
3. **Simple aliphatic chains or ethers** often have **0.0** (e.g., `ClCCl`, `CCCCCC(O)CC`, `CCCCOCCO`).
4. **Steroid-like or polycyclic structures with hydroxyl groups** sometimes have **-0.03107967** (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O`).

The molecule in question is:
```
CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O
```
This is a **steroid-like polycyclic structure** with a **carbonyl (C=O) group** and a **hydroxyl (OH) group**, similar to some of the examples with **-0.03107967**. 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**-0.03107967**

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 3.8564812933452846
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, we can deduce the following:

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - Many molecules with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1`, `O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12`) have a property value of **-0.09270983**.
   - However, if the nitro group is part of a more complex or polar structure (e.g., `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`), the value can deviate (e.g., **3.40264009**).

2. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**:
   - The amide group (`C(=O)N`) appears in molecules like `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (value: **-1.21476499**) and `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` (value: **2.41951122**), indicating that its effect depends on the broader context.

3. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple nitro-substituted aromatics tend toward **-0.09270983**, but additional substituents (especially polar ones like amides) can significantly alter the value.

4. **Specific Case**:
   - The molecule `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has:
     - A nitro group on an aromatic ring (typically **-0.09270983**).
     - An acetamido group (`CC(=O)N-`) attached to the same ring, which introduces polarity and potential hydrogen bonding.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `CC(C)c1ccccc1` (no nitro group, just an alkyl-substituted benzene) has a value of **-0.06198445**.
- `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` (nitrobenzene) has a value of **-0.09270983**.
- `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` (amide + aliphatic chain) has a value of **-1.21476499**.
- `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` (amide + nitro + aromatic) has a value of **2.41951122**.

Given that `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` combines an amide and a nitro group on the same aromatic ring, the property value is likely influenced by both. The nitro group's effect is partially offset by the amide's polarity, but the net result is still close to the nitro-aromatic baseline.

### Predicted Property Value:
The most plausible prediction, based on the examples, is:  
**-0.09270983**  

This aligns with the recurring value for nitro-substituted aromatic systems, as the amide group's influence does not appear strong enough in the given data to significantly deviate from this baseline.

Iteration: 18
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 3.729609603129654
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Heteroatoms**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings containing heteroatoms (e.g., nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur) often have property values around **3.4** (e.g., `OCc1ccccc1: 3.40264009`, `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2: 3.40264009`).
   - If the aromatic system is fused or has additional polar groups (e.g., carbonyls), the value can be higher (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O: 3.85648129`).

2. **Phosphorus and Sulfur Groups**:
   - The presence of **P(=S)** and **S** groups is not directly represented in the examples, but sulfur-containing aromatic systems (e.g., `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3: 3.85648129`) tend to have higher values (~3.8).

3. **Chlorine Substituents**:
   - Chlorine on aromatic rings does not significantly lower the property (e.g., `Clc1cccc2ccccc12: -0.09270983`), but the aromatic system's contribution dominates.

4. **Fused Aromatic Systems**:
   - Fused aromatic systems with polar groups (e.g., carbonyls) tend to have higher values (e.g., `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O: 3.86775957`).

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
The molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12** has:
- A **fused aromatic system** with a **carbonyl (C=O)** and **chlorine substituent**.
- A **phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**, which is polar and likely increases the property value.
- An **ethyl group (OCC)** and **thioether (S)** linkage, similar to sulfur-containing examples with high values (~3.8).

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to molecules with values around **3.8-3.9** (e.g., `O=Cc2ccc1OCOc1c2: 3.85648129`, `Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O: 3.85648129`), and the presence of **P(=S)** and **S** groups, the predicted property value is likely in this range. 

#### Final Prediction:
**3.85648129** (same as other high-value sulfur/aromatic carbonyl-containing molecules in the examples).

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns regarding the property values:

1. Simple aliphatic alcohols (e.g., CCC(C)O, CCCC(C)O, CCCC(O)CCC) consistently have a property value of 0.0.
2. The molecule CC(C)(C)CO is a tertiary aliphatic alcohol (2-methyl-2-propanol or tert-butanol), which fits this category.
3. No examples of tertiary alcohols deviate from this 0.0 pattern in the provided data.
4. The presence of branching (as in CC(C)CO which is isobutanol) doesn't change the property value from 0.0 when it's still a simple aliphatic alcohol.

Given this consistent pattern for aliphatic alcohols in the training data, the predicted property value for CC(C)(C)CO is:

0.0

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12

Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12`, let's break down the prediction:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Small, planar heterocycles with polar groups (e.g., N, O, =O)** often have property values close to **-0.09270983**:
   - Examples: `Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2`, `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F`, `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1`, `Nc1ccccc1`.
   - These molecules typically contain nitrogen or oxygen in aromatic rings, sometimes with carbonyl groups.

2. **The target molecule** (`O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12`) is a **purine-like heterocycle** with:
   - Two fused rings (imidazole + pyrimidine).
   - Multiple nitrogen atoms and a carbonyl group (=O).
   - High polarity and hydrogen-bonding capability (NH groups).

3. **Similar structures** in the examples (e.g., `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F`, `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1`) consistently show the value **-0.09270983**.

4. **Larger or less polar molecules** deviate from this value, but the target is small and polar.

### Prediction:
The target molecule fits the pattern of small, polar heterocycles with nitrogen and carbonyl groups, which consistently correlate with the property value **-0.09270983**.

**Final Answer:**  
`-0.09270983`
==================================================
Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 3.744202980887865
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns for the property values:

1. **Simple aliphatic chains or alcohols (e.g., CCCC, CCO, CC(C)O, C(C)(C)C)**: These typically have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain highly polar or functional groups that introduce asymmetry or conjugation.

2. **Aromatic or conjugated systems (e.g., benzene derivatives, polycyclic aromatics)**: These often have small negative values (e.g., -0.09270983) unless they include additional functional groups that significantly alter the property.

3. **Highly polar or complex functional groups (e.g., amides, nitro groups, halogens, ketones, esters)**: These can lead to larger positive or negative values depending on the specific arrangement and electronegativity effects.

4. **Aldehydes (C=O)**: When part of a larger conjugated system (e.g., COc1ccc(C=O)cc1), they can lead to high positive values (e.g., 3.85648129). However, in simpler aliphatic contexts, the effect may be less pronounced.

### Prediction for **CC(C)OC=O**:
This molecule is an ester derivative (specifically, an aldehyde-ester hybrid: **isopropyl formate**). It has the following features:
- A simple aliphatic chain (**CC(C)O**), which would typically contribute **0.0**.
- An aldehyde group (**C=O**), which can increase the property value when conjugated but here is part of a simple ester.

Given the lack of conjugation or extended aromaticity, and comparing to similar small polar molecules (e.g., CCOC=O would likely behave like other simple esters/alcohols), the property value is likely **0.0**.

However, the presence of the **C=O** might introduce a slight deviation. Looking at similar cases:
- **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (a phosphate ester) has **0.0**.
- **CCCOC(C)C** (an ether) has **0.0**.
- **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4...** (a complex ketone/ester) has **3.03675432**, but this is due to the extended conjugated system.

Since **CC(C)OC=O** is a simple ester without conjugation or aromaticity, the most reasonable prediction is **0.0**.

### Final Answer:
**0.0**

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) with no strongly polar or functional groups** tend to have property values close to **-0.09270983** (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl`, `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`, `c1ccncc1`).
2. **Aliphatic or non-aromatic cyclic structures (e.g., cyclohexane, sugars)** often have a property value of **0.0** (e.g., `C1CCCCC1`, `OCC(O)CO`, `OC1CCCCC1`).
3. **Molecules with amide or urea-like functional groups** (e.g., `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1`) tend to have **higher positive values (e.g., ~3.7)**.
4. **Molecules with extended conjugation or aromatic systems with electron-donating/withdrawing groups** can have **intermediate values (e.g., 1.1 to 3.8)**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2** is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms of the urea core (`N-C(=O)-N`). 

From the examples:
- `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (cyclic urea) has a value of **3.74420298**.
- `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (aromatic amide) has a value of **-0.09270983**, but this is simpler and lacks the urea core.
- Urea-like structures with aromatic substituents (like the target molecule) are not explicitly in the examples, but the cyclic urea suggests higher values (~3.7).

Given the **urea core with two aromatic rings**, this molecule likely has a **higher positive property value**, similar to other urea/amide-containing molecules in the dataset. 

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **~3.7**, based on the closest structural analog (`C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1`). 

**Final Prediction: 3.74420298** (same as the cyclic urea example, as the structural influence is very similar).

True Property: 3.544329980846406
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13** (which is fluorene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon), I can make the following observations:

1. **Aromatic Systems**: Many molecules with extended aromatic systems (e.g., polycyclic aromatics like naphthalene, anthracene, or fluorene) tend to have a property value of **-0.09270983** in the provided dataset. Examples include:
   - `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (azobenzene-like structure): **-0.09270983**
   - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` (polychlorinated biphenyl): **-0.09270983**
   - `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (large polycyclic aromatic): **-0.09270983**
   - `Sc1ccccc1` (thiophene derivative): **-0.09270983**
   - `Brc1ccccc1` (bromobenzene): **-0.09270983**

2. **Fluorene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13)** is a fused aromatic system similar to biphenyl or naphthalene derivatives, which are represented in the examples above with the value **-0.09270983**.

3. **Non-aromatic or aliphatic systems** tend to have values closer to **0.0** or other distinct values, but the aromatic systems consistently show **-0.09270983** when they lack strongly polar or functionalized groups.

### Conclusion:
The property value for **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (fluorene)** is predicted to be **-0.09270983**, matching the trend observed for similar aromatic systems in the dataset. 

**Final answer: -0.09270983**

Iteration: 24
SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I can attempt to identify patterns that correlate molecular structures with the property values. Here are some observations:

1. **Simple aliphatic chains** (e.g., `CC(C)Cl`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`, `CCCOCC`) tend to have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain functional groups or unsaturation.

2. **Aromatic systems** with simple substitutions (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1C`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`) often have values around **-0.09270983** or **-0.06198445**, especially if halogens (Cl, Br) are present.

3. **Polar or conjugated systems** (e.g., `CC(C)C(=O)C`, `OCc1ccccc1`, `CNC(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc12`) tend to have **higher positive values** (e.g., 3.40264009, 3.7296096).

4. **Sulfonamides or sulfonyl groups** (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)ON=C(C#N)c1ccccc1`) often have values around **-0.06198445**.

5. **Complex heterocycles** with multiple nitrogens or oxygens (e.g., `Cn1cnc2n(C)c(=O)n(C)c(=O)c12`) tend to have **positive values** (e.g., 2.10974558).

### Target Molecule: `NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1`
- This molecule contains:
  - A **sulfonamide group** (`NS(=O)(=O)`), which often appears with values around **-0.06198445** or **-0.09270983**.
  - An **aromatic ring** with an amino group (`c1ccc(N)cc1`), which could slightly increase the value.
  - A **guanidine-like group** (`NC(=N)N`), which is polar and may contribute to a higher value.

Given the presence of the sulfonamide (which tends to lower the value) but also the polar guanidine and aromatic amine (which may raise it), the value is likely **moderate but positive**.

### Predicted Property Value:
Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for `NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` is:  
**1.17107069** (similar to other sulfonamide-containing polar molecules like `CC(C)(C)C(=O)C(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)n2cncn2`). 

However, if the sulfonamide dominates, it could also be closer to **-0.06198445**. Given the additional polar groups, I lean toward the higher value. 

Final prediction: **1.17107069**

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 2.5777751324212965
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**: The molecule has two nitro groups attached to the aromatic ring. From the examples, nitro groups often appear with property values around **-0.09270983** (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`, `Clc1ccccc1`, `Brc1ccccc1`).
2. **Trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)**: This is a strongly electron-withdrawing group. In the examples, such groups (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O`) are associated with higher property values (**3.20079652**).
3. **Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C))**: This is a moderately electron-donating group. In the examples, similar groups (e.g., `CCN(CC)c1ccccc1`) are associated with property values around **3.22455317**.
4. **Aromatic system with substitutions**: The molecule has a heavily substituted aromatic ring, which can influence the property value based on the balance of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects.

### Observations from Examples:
- Molecules with **nitro groups alone** tend to have property values close to **-0.09270983**.
- Molecules with **both nitro and strong electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, CF3)** tend to have higher property values (e.g., **3.20079652** for `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O`).
- The presence of **tertiary amine** can further increase the property value (e.g., **3.22455317** for `CCN(CC)c1ccccc1`).

### Prediction:
Given the combination of:
- Two nitro groups (tending toward **-0.09270983**),
- A strong electron-withdrawing CF3 group (pushing toward **~3.2**),
- A tertiary amine (pushing toward **~3.2**),

the property value is likely **higher than the nitro-only examples but balanced by the electron-withdrawing effects**. A reasonable estimate is around **3.0**, similar to molecules like `Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O` (3.20079652) or `CC1CC2C3CCC(O)(C(=O)C)C3(C)CC(O)C2(F)C4(C)C=CC(=O)C=C14` (3.01373065).

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**3.20079652** (rounded to **3.20**)
==================================================
Iteration: 26
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 3.744202980887865
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on the molecular structures:

1. **Simple alkanes, alcohols, and halogenated alkanes** (e.g., `CCCCCC(C)O`, `ClC(Cl)Cl`, `CCC(C)(C)O`) typically have a property value of **0.0**. These are generally non-polar or minimally functionalized molecules.

2. **Molecules with aldehydes (`C=O`)** often have higher positive values:
   - `CCCC=O` has a value of **3.74420298**.
   - `O=C1CCCCC1` (cyclic aldehyde) has **2.35770279**.
   - `CC(C)CCOC=O` (ester-like structure with aldehyde) has **2.35770279**.

3. **Aromatic systems with polar substituents** (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, or halogens) often have values around **-0.09270983** or **3.40264009**, depending on the specific substituents and their positions.

4. **Molecules with amides, sulfonamides, or complex heterocycles** tend to have negative values (e.g., `-0.77283707`, `-1.46284521`).

### Prediction for `CC(C)OC=O`:
This molecule is an ester derivative with an aldehyde-like structure (`OC=O`). It resembles `CC(C)CCOC=O` (property = **2.35770279**) and `O=C1CCCCC1` (property = **2.35770279**), both of which have aldehyde or aldehyde-like functional groups and values around **2.35**. 

The presence of the `OC=O` group (similar to an ester or aldehyde) suggests a comparable property value. The branching (`CC(C)`) is unlikely to drastically alter the property, as seen in other branched examples.

**Predicted property value: 2.35770279** (matching the trend for aldehyde/ester-like structures).

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -1.3800318216428353
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, we can deduce the following:

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Aromatic Rings with Hydroxyl (-OH) Groups**:  
   - Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., benzene) and hydroxyl groups (e.g., **Oc1ccccc1**, **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**) tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., 3.67997357, 3.85648129).  
   - The hydroxyl group increases the property value significantly.

2. **Effect of Alkyl Substituents (e.g., Methyl -CH3)**:  
   - Alkyl groups (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1C**) slightly reduce the property value but do not negate the effect of the hydroxyl group.  
   - Example: **Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)c2cc(c(Cl)cc2O)S(N)(=O)=O** has a value of **3.67997357**, showing that alkyl groups do not dominate over hydroxyl contributions.

3. **Molecules with No Polar/Aromatic Features**:  
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., **CC(C)C**, **C1CCOC1**) have a property value of **0.0**.  
   - Halogenated aromatics without hydroxyl groups (e.g., **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**) have a value of **-0.09270983**.

4. **Hybrid Cases**:  
   - **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** has:  
     - An aromatic ring (contributing positively).  
     - A hydroxyl group (strongly positive contribution).  
     - Two methyl groups (slightly negative or neutral contribution).  

### Prediction:  
Given the hydroxyl group's dominance and the aromatic ring, the property value should be **positive and moderately high**, similar to other hydroxylated aromatics.  

Comparing to:  
- **Oc1ccccc1** (phenol) → Not in the dataset, but analogous to **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde, **-0.09270983**), except the hydroxyl group would raise the value.  
- **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3** → **3.67997357** (multiple hydroxyls).  
- **Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)c2cc(c(Cl)cc2O)S(N)(=O)=O** → **3.67997357** (hydroxyl + aromatic).  

Since **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** has only one hydroxyl and two methyls, the value should be **lower than 3.67997357 but still positive**.  

A reasonable estimate is **~2.38869558** (similar to **c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC**, which has hydroxyls and alkyl chains).  

### Final Predicted Property Value:  
**2.38869558**

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 3.224553167474091
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Property = 0.0**: 
   - Simple alkanes, cycloalkanes, or molecules with no polar/functional groups (e.g., `OC1CCCCC1`, `CC(C)C(C)(C)C`, `ClCC(Cl)(Cl)Cl`).
   - Symmetrical or non-reactive structures.

2. **Property ≈ -0.09270983**: 
   - Aromatic rings with halogen substitutions (Cl, Br, F) or heterocycles (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1`, `C=CC#N`).
   - Presence of electronegative atoms (Cl, N, O) in conjugated systems.

3. **Property ≈ -1.38003182**: 
   - Phenolic or aromatic systems with alkyl substitutions (e.g., `Cc1ccc(O)c(C)c1`, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl`).
   - Phosphorothioate derivatives (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`).

4. **Property ≈ -1.60709262**: 
   - Complex phosphorothioates with additional functional groups (e.g., `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C`).

5. **Other Values**: 
   - Highly specific structures (e.g., steroids, polyaromatics) or unique functional groups lead to outliers (e.g., `Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32` has a high value of 3.20079652).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**  
- Contains a **phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)O)**, similar to molecules with property ≈ -1.38003182 (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl`).
- Also has a **methylthio group (SC)** and a **methyl substitution (C)** on the aromatic ring, which are moderately electron-donating but not as polar as halogens.
- The structure is most analogous to the phosphorothioate examples with property ≈ -1.38003182.

### Predicted Property:
The property value is likely **-1.38003182**, matching the trend for phosphorothioate-containing aromatic systems with moderate substitutions. The additional SC group does not significantly deviate from the observed pattern. 

**Final Answer:**  
`-1.38003182`
==================================================
Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property value tends to be **-0.09270983** for molecules with the following characteristics:
1. Aromatic rings (especially benzene-like structures).
2. Multiple halogen substitutions (e.g., Cl, Br).
3. No strongly polar or ionizable functional groups (e.g., no carboxylic acids, amines, or sulfonamides in a charged state).

The molecule in question, **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, fits this pattern well:
- It is a polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure (two benzene rings with multiple Cl substitutions).
- There are no additional functional groups that would significantly alter the property (e.g., no nitro, carbonyl, or charged groups).

Several similar examples from the given data support this:
- **Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1**: -0.09270983  
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: -0.09270983  
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl**: -0.09270983  

Thus, the predicted property value for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is:  
**-0.09270983**
==================================================
Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes** (e.g., CCC, C1CCCCC1, CC, C=Cc1ccccc1) typically have a property value of **0.0** or **-0.09270983**, unless they have functional groups or other modifiers.
2. **Nitro Groups (NO2)**:
   - The nitro group appears in several molecules, often with a property value of **-0.09270983** (e.g., `N(=O)=O` in aromatic systems like `c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`).
   - However, when the nitro group is part of a larger or more complex structure (e.g., `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N`), the value remains **-0.09270983**.
   - In `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (a trinitrobenzene derivative), the value is **-0.09270983**, suggesting nitro groups alone do not significantly alter the property unless combined with other features.
3. **Aliphatic Nitro Compounds**:
   - The molecule `CCCN(=O)=O` is an aliphatic nitro compound (nitropropane). None of the given examples are direct aliphatic nitro compounds, but we can infer from the nitro-aromatic examples that the nitro group tends to assign a value close to **-0.09270983** unless other functional groups dominate.
   - The presence of an aliphatic chain (CCC) is not strongly influential (e.g., `CCC` has a value of **0.0**), so the nitro group is likely the dominant feature.
4. **Similar Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with polar or electronegative groups (e.g., `O=C1CNC(=O)N1` with urea-like structure) have values like **-0.06198445**, which is close to **-0.09270983** but slightly less negative.
   - The nitro group is highly polar and electronegative, similar to these cases.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- The nitro group in aromatic systems assigns **-0.09270983**.
- Aliphatic chains alone assign **0.0**.
- The nitro group is the dominant feature here, and no other conflicting functional groups are present, the value is likely close to the nitro-aromatic examples.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCN(=O)=O** is:  
**-0.09270983**

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe certain patterns in the property values based on the molecular structures:

1. Simple halogenated aromatic compounds (e.g., Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl) tend to have property values around -0.09270983.
2. The presence of nitro groups (N(=O)=O) often leads to higher positive values (~3.40264009).
3. Simple aliphatic compounds (e.g., CCCBr, CCCC(C)C) typically have property values of 0.0.
4. Compounds with both halogens and other functional groups may have intermediate values.

The molecule in question is Fc1cccc(Br)c1, which is a simple halogenated aromatic compound with fluorine and bromine substituents. This is structurally similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, which has a property value of -0.09270983.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is: -0.09270983
==================================================
Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question, **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, I can predict its property value based on structural similarities and trends observed in the provided data.

### Key Observations:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains/Alkanes (e.g., CBr, CCCCBr, CCCCCCCCC(C)O, CCCCCCCI)**:
   - These molecules have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain functional groups that significantly alter the property.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **Alcohols (e.g., CCCC(C)(C)O, CC(C)(C)CO)**: Typically **0.0** unless part of a more complex structure.
   - **Ethers (e.g., CCOCCC, COCOC)**: Typically **0.0** unless conjugated with aromatic systems or other polar groups.
   - **Carbonyls (e.g., CCCC(=O)C, COC(=O)c1ccccc1)**: Increase the property value (e.g., **1.11974769** for aliphatic ketones, **3.85648129** for aromatic esters).

3. **Cyclic Structures with Oxygen or Functional Groups**:
   - **CC1CCCO1 (cyclic ether)**: **0.0** (simple cyclic ether).
   - **CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O (lactam with aromatic substitution)**: **3.7296096** (due to aromaticity and polar groups).
   - **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2**: **-1.59625447** (complex structure with multiple substituents).

4. **Steroids/Terpenes (e.g., CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO)**:
   - These large, rigid, polycyclic structures with polar groups (e.g., C=O, OH) tend to have **high positive values (e.g., 3.74420298)**.

5. **The Molecule in Question: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**:
   - This is a **bicyclic structure with a tertiary alcohol**.
   - Similar to simpler cyclic alcohols (e.g., **CC1CCCO1** with **0.0**), but the bicyclic nature and additional substitutions may slightly increase the value.
   - No aromaticity or highly polar groups (e.g., C=O, S=O) are present, so the value is unlikely to be as high as the steroids/terpenes.
   - The closest analog is **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, which is a simpler terpene-like structure without additional polar groups.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural simplicity (bicyclic with one OH group) and lack of strongly polarizing functional groups, the predicted value is likely **close to 0.0**, but slightly higher due to the rigid bicyclic framework. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**0.5** (interpolating between simple alcohols (0.0) and more complex polycyclic structures (e.g., 1.11974769 for **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**)).

However, reviewing the examples more carefully, **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** is structurally similar to **CC1(C)CCC2C1CCC3C2CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C** (which has a value of **1.11974769**), but without the C=O group. Thus, the value should be lower but still positive.

### Final Prediction:
**1.0** (rounded estimate based on structural analogs). 

For higher precision, the exact value would likely be between **0.5 and 1.2**, but given the examples, **1.0** is a reasonable approximation. 

(Note: Without a direct analog in the training data, this is an interpolated estimate.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.06198444840580991
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can attempt to predict the property for the molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` by comparing its structural features to those of the molecules in the dataset. 

### Observations:
1. **Structural Similarity**: The molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` is very similar to the molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` from the dataset, which has a property value of **3.93839584**. The only difference is the replacement of `SC(CCl)` with `N` in the new molecule. This suggests that the property value might be close to this value, as the core structure (phosphate/sulfur group attached to a phenyl ring with a lactam) is preserved.

2. **Key Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule contains a `P(=S)` (thiophosphate) group, which is also present in the similar molecule from the dataset (property = 3.93839584).
   - It has a phenyl ring (`c1ccccc1`) and a lactam (`N2C(=O)...C2=O`), which are also present in the similar molecule.
   - The absence of the `SC(CCl)` group might slightly alter the property, but the core structure is likely dominant in determining the value.

3. **Other Comparisons**:
   - Molecules with `P(=S)` or similar polar/charged groups tend to have higher property values (e.g., 3.93839584 for the similar molecule).
   - Simpler aromatic or aliphatic molecules tend to have lower or negative values (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1Cl` = -0.09270983).

### Prediction:
Given the strong similarity to the molecule with property value **3.93839584**, and considering that the modification (replacing `SC(CCl)` with `N`) is unlikely to drastically change the property (since the core polar/aromatic structure is intact), I predict the property for `CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` to be close to this value. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value is **3.93839584**.

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 1.6497363640061333
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **diketopiperazine-like** or **quinoxaline-like** core with a **carbonyl group (=O)** and **two nitrogen atoms** in a fused ring system. This is similar to the following example:
   - **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property: **3.85648129**), which has a fused ring with a carbonyl and nitrogen atoms.

2. **Substituents**: 
   - The molecule has **methyl groups (C)** attached to the nitrogen atoms and an **aromatic ring (c2ccccc2)** fused to the core. This is analogous to the example above, where aromatic rings and methyl groups are present.

3. **Electron-Withdrawing/Delocalization**: 
   - The **carbonyl group (=O)** and **nitrogen atoms** create electron delocalization, which likely contributes to a higher property value (as seen in similar structures).

### Comparison to Examples:
- Molecules with **fused aromatic rings, carbonyl groups, and nitrogen heterocycles** tend to have **higher property values** (e.g., **3.85648129**, **3.54432998**, **3.40264009**).
- The closest match is **Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O** (property: **3.85648129**), which shares:
  - A fused aromatic system.
  - A carbonyl group.
  - Nitrogen atoms in the ring.
  - Methyl substituents.

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong similarity to the example with a value of **3.85648129**, the predicted property for **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** is likely in the same range. 

#### Final Prediction:
**3.85648129** (same as the closest matching example).

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.18411745879254163
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I will analyze the given molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** and predict its property value.

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
The molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is a hexanoic acid ethyl ester (ethyl hexanoate). Structurally, it consists of:
- A linear 6-carbon chain (**CCCCC**) 
- A carbonyl group (**C=O**) 
- An ethoxy group (**OCC**) attached to the carbonyl carbon.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alcohols/Ethers (e.g., OCC(O)C(O)CO, CCCC, CCOC(=O)N)**: These tend to have a property value of **0.0**, especially if they lack conjugated systems or strongly polarizing groups.
2. **Esters (e.g., CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2)**: These often have higher property values (e.g., 3.85648129, 3.35974289), especially if they are part of complex or conjugated systems.
3. **Simple esters (e.g., CCOC(=O)N)**: These can have slightly negative or small positive values (e.g., -0.03107967), but not as high as conjugated/complex esters.

### Key Features of **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- It is a simple, non-conjugated ester.
- It lacks aromaticity, extended conjugation, or strongly polarizing substituents (like halogens or nitro groups).
- It is structurally similar to **CC(=O)OC...** examples but simpler (no rings or additional functional groups).

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- **CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: This is a complex steroid-like ester with multiple rings and conjugation (property = 3.35974289). Our molecule is much simpler.
- **CCOC(=O)N**: A simple ethyl carbamate (property = -0.03107967). Our molecule is slightly larger but similarly simple.
- **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**: A simple nonyl ester (property = -0.91748554). This is structurally similar to our molecule but with a longer chain.

### Prediction:
Given that:
1. Simple aliphatic esters without conjugation tend to have property values close to **0.0** or slightly negative.
2. The molecule is most similar to **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (property = -0.91748554), but with a slightly shorter chain and an ethoxy instead of methoxy group.

The predicted property value for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is likely in the range of **-0.9 to 0.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.91748554** (same as **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**, as the structural difference is minor). 

However, since the ethoxy group might slightly reduce the magnitude compared to the methoxy group, an alternative prediction could be **-0.5**. But given the examples, sticking to **-0.91748554** is more consistent.

### Final Answer:
**-0.91748554**

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 3.8564812933452846
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate) shares structural similarities with other aromatic esters or benzoate derivatives in the dataset. 

Here are the relevant examples from the dataset:
- **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate): **-0.41550918**
- **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (ethyl salicylate): **-0.41550918**
- **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC** (a diester): **-1.64332116** (this is more complex, so less relevant).

The molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is almost identical to **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate), except for the methyl group instead of ethyl. Since the property value for ethyl benzoate is **-0.41550918**, and the substitution of ethyl vs. methyl is unlikely to drastically change the property (as seen in other cases where small alkyl changes don't affect the property, e.g., **CC(C)(C)CCO** vs. **CCCCCCCCO** both being **0.0**), the predicted property for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** should be very close to that of ethyl benzoate.

### Predicted property for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1**: **-0.41550918** (same as ethyl benzoate). 

This is consistent with the trend that simple aromatic esters with no additional polar or charged groups tend to have this property value in the dataset.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.6804153220897466
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), we can deduce the following:

1. **Patterns in the Data**:
   - Simple hydrocarbons with no functional groups (e.g., **C1CCCC1**, **CCC(C)(C)CC**, **CCC(O)C(C)C**) tend to have a property value of **0.0**.
   - Molecules with conjugated systems or double bonds (e.g., **C=Cc1ccccc1**) often have a value of **-0.09270983**.
   - The molecule **CC/C=C/C** (2-pentene) has a value of **-1.64332116**, but this seems to be an outlier compared to other alkenes like **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene), which has **-0.09270983**. This suggests that the property may not be strictly tied to the presence of double bonds alone but possibly to other structural features.

2. **Key Observations for C=CCC=C**:
   - The molecule is a simple conjugated diene (1,3-butadiene), similar in simplicity to **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene) but without an aromatic ring.
   - Given that **C=Cc1ccccc1** has a value of **-0.09270983**, and other simple hydrocarbons have **0.0**, the presence of the conjugated double bonds likely assigns it a value close to **-0.09270983**.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Since **C=CCC=C** is a conjugated system but lacks additional functional groups or complexity, its property value is most likely **-0.09270983**, matching the trend observed for similar unsaturated hydrocarbons.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **C=CCC=C** is **-0.09270983**.

True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I observe that the property value tends to be **0.0** for certain types of molecules, particularly:

1. Simple halogenated alkanes (e.g., `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` → 0.0).
2. Fully halogenated or symmetric small molecules without polar or aromatic features (e.g., `COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` → 0.0, `C1CCCCC1` → 0.0).
3. Molecules with no significant charge separation or conjugated systems.

The molecule `BrC(Br)Br` (tribromomethane) fits this pattern:
- It is a simple, fully halogenated alkane.
- It lacks aromaticity, polar functional groups, or conjugated systems that would contribute to non-zero property values in the examples (e.g., nitro groups, carbonyls, or heterocycles).
- It is structurally similar to `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` (property = 0.0), where halogens dominate the structure without introducing asymmetry or polarity that would deviate from 0.0.

Thus, the predicted property value for `BrC(Br)Br` is:  
**0.0**

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 3.9383958408261344
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: Present in **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 3.78308651). This group is associated with higher property values (often > 3).
2. **Aromatic Ring (c1ccccc1)**: Common in many molecules, but its contribution depends on substituents. Here, it's part of a lactam (cyclic amide) structure.
3. **Lactam (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: Similar to cyclic amides in other examples, but the exact contribution depends on context.
4. **Chlorinated Alkyl (C(CCl))**: Chlorine substituents often correlate with property values around -0.09270983, but here it's part of a larger functionalized structure.
5. **Ethoxy Groups (CCO and OCC)**: These are polar but not strongly predictive on their own.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a property of **3.78308651**. This molecule also contains P(=S) and aromatic/chlorinated groups.
- **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has a property of **3.40264009**, suggesting polychlorinated aromatic systems can elevate the property.
- **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has a property of **3.40264009**, indicating nitroaromatics also contribute to higher values.

### Key Observations:
- The presence of **P(=S)** is a strong indicator of a higher property value (> 3).
- The lactam and aromatic ring may slightly modulate the value but are less impactful than the phosphorothioate group.
- The chlorinated alkyl (CCl) might slightly reduce the value compared to purely aromatic chlorinated systems.

### Predicted Property:
Given the dominance of the **P(=S)** group and its association with values > 3 in similar molecules, the predicted property for **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is likely in the range of **3.4 to 3.8**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**3.6** (interpolating between similar examples). 

However, since **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** is very structurally similar (same P(=S) core with aromatic and halogenated substituents) and has a value of **3.78308651**, the closest match for this molecule would be:  
**Predicted property = 3.78308651** (same as the most similar example). 

### Final Answer:
**3.78308651**

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 3.224553167474091
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Amide Group (-N(C)C(=O)-)**: 
   - Present in molecules like **CN(C)C(=O)C** (property = 3.74420298) and **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (property = 3.64730687). These suggest that amides with N,N-dimethyl substitution tend to have high positive property values (~3.6–3.7).

2. **Aromatic Ring with Chlorine Substituent (c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)**:
   - Chlorinated aromatics like **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** and **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** have property = -0.09270983. However, this value seems to be a default for many aromatic systems unless other dominant features override it.

3. **Heterocyclic Fragment (n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C)**:
   - This resembles a fused or substituted heterocycle with a carbonyl (=O) and bulky tert-butyl group (**C(C)(C)C**). Similar fragments (e.g., **Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23**) can have high positive values (4.00174157), but the exact contribution depends on the context.

4. **Overall Polarity and Functional Groups**:
   - The molecule has polar amide and heterocyclic carbonyl groups, which may increase the property value, but the chlorine and aromaticity may partially counteract this.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest matches are **CN(C)C(=O)C** (3.744) and **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (3.647), where the amide dominates. The additional aromatic and heterocyclic components here may slightly reduce the value compared to these simpler amides but keep it in a similar range.
- The default aromatic value (-0.0927) is likely overridden by the amide and heterocycle.

### Predicted Property:
Given the dominance of the N,N-dimethylamide and the heterocyclic carbonyl, the property value is expected to be **~3.6**, similar to **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** (3.64730687). The chlorine and bulky groups may slightly lower it.

**Final Prediction: 3.5** (approximate, likely between 3.4 and 3.7).  
For specificity, we'll assign **3.55**.  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on pattern-matching from the examples.)*

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic rings with Cl and OH substituents** often have a property value of **-0.09270983**:
   - Examples:
     - `c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2` → -0.09270983
     - `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` → -0.09270983
     - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` → -0.09270983
     - `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` → -0.09270983
     - `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` → -0.09270983
     - `O=N(=O)c1c(Cl)c(Cl)ccc1` → -0.09270983
     - `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` → -0.09270983

2. The molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** fits this pattern:
   - It consists of two aromatic rings (phenols) linked by an oxygen bridge.
   - Each ring has **Cl substituents** and **OH groups**, similar to the examples above.

3. No additional functional groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, or charged groups) are present that would deviate from the observed trend.

### Conclusion:
The property value for **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** is most likely **-0.09270983**, consistent with other aromatic systems with Cl and OH substituents.

### Final Answer:
**-0.09270983**

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -1.64332116091804
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the molecule `CC/C=C\C` is a stereoisomer of `CC/C=C/C` (which has a property value of -1.64332116). The property being predicted does not appear to be highly sensitive to stereochemistry (cis/trans or E/Z) in this case, as the values for similar structures are consistent regardless of stereochemistry. 

For example:
- `CC/C=C/C` has a value of -1.64332116.
- `CC/C=C\C` is the trans (or E) version of the same molecule, and the property is likely very similar.

Thus, the predicted property value for `CC/C=C\C` is likely the same as for `CC/C=C/C`, which is **-1.64332116**. 

This is based on the observation that small changes in stereochemistry do not significantly alter the property in the given dataset.

Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), we can deduce the following:

1. **Patterns in the Data**:
   - Simple aliphatic ethers (e.g., **CCOC**) and hydrocarbons (e.g., **C**, **CC(C)O**, **CCCCO**) often have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain functional groups that significantly alter the property (e.g., halogens, nitro groups, carbonyls, etc.).
   - The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, F) or aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing/donating groups tends to shift the property value away from 0.0.
   - **CCCOCC** is a symmetrical aliphatic ether with no polar or functionalized substituents, similar to **CCOC** (not explicitly in the examples but analogous to other simple ethers/aliphatics).

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) has a value of **0.0**, despite having an OH group.
   - **C1CCCCCC1** (cyclohexane) has a value of **0.0**.
   - **CCSSCC** (a disulfide) has a value of **0.0**, suggesting that non-polar or symmetrically functionalized molecules often default to 0.0.
   - **CCCOCC** lacks any asymmetric or strongly polarizing features, so it likely follows this trend.

3. **Conclusion**:
   The property value for **CCCOCC** is predicted to be **0.0**, consistent with other simple, symmetrical, and non-polar/aliphatic molecules in the dataset. 

**Final Answer**: 0.0

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.9420899649815941
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns in the property values:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Property = 0.0**:
   - Simple alkanes (e.g., `C`, `CCCCCC`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCO`), alcohols (e.g., `OC1CCCCC1`), and other non-polar or weakly polar molecules.
   - No aromatic rings or functional groups that significantly alter polarity/reactivity.

2. **Property ≈ -0.09270983**:
   - Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br), nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`), or heterocycles containing N/O/S (e.g., `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(N=CNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl`, `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F`).
   - Often involve sulfonamides, nitro groups, or fused aromatic systems with halogens.

3. **Property ≈ 3.4–4.0**:
   - Molecules with extended aromatic systems (e.g., `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`, `Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O`).
   - Amides, esters, or phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`).
   - Conjugated systems or multiple aromatic rings (e.g., `Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13`).

4. **Negative values (≈ -1.3 to -1.6)**:
   - Alkenes, aldehydes, or strained rings (e.g., `CC=CC=O`, `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23`).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**:
- It contains **two aromatic rings** (one substituted with a bulky tert-butyl-like group via an amide linkage).
- It has a **tertiary amide** (`N(C(=O)N...)`) and **two phenyl rings** attached to nitrogen.
- Structurally similar to examples with property values ≈ **3.4–4.0** (e.g., `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has 3.40264009, and `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` has 3.85648129).

### Prediction:
Given the presence of two aromatic rings and a polar amide group, the property value is likely in the **higher range (≈3.4–4.0)**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 3.85648129**  
*(This aligns with similar molecules in the examples, such as `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` at 3.85648129.)*

Iteration: 45
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 3.8564812933452846
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Substituents**:
   - Many molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) and simple substituents (e.g., Br, Cl, NO2, OCH3) tend to have a property value of **-0.09270983**. Examples:
     - `c1ccccc1n2ncc(N)c(Br)c2(=O)`: -0.09270983
     - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1`: -0.09270983
     - `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`: -0.09270983
     - `Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1`: -0.09270983
     - `Fc1cccc(Br)c1`: -0.09270983
     - `c2ccc1scnc1c2`: -0.09270983
     - `c1ccoc1`: -0.09270983
   - This suggests that simple aromatic systems with halogens or other common substituents often have this value.

2. **Amide or Aniline Derivatives**:
   - Molecules with **amide (N-C=O)** or **aniline (N attached to aromatic ring)** groups often deviate from the -0.09270983 baseline:
     - `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`: -0.94208996 (amide + aromatic)
     - `Cc1ccc(N)cc1`: 3.40264009 (aniline derivative)
     - `ClCc1ccccc1`: 3.40264009 (benzyl chloride, similar to aniline in aromatic + substituent)
     - `C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`: 3.40264009 (aromatic with alkyl link)
   - The presence of **N attached to an aromatic ring** (aniline-like) seems to correlate with **~3.40264009**.

3. **Bromine Substituent**:
   - Bromine on an aromatic ring alone does not change the baseline (-0.09270983), but when combined with other features (e.g., amide/aniline), it may follow the dominant feature.

### Analysis of **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**:
- The molecule is **N-phenylacetamide (acetanilide)** with a **Br substituent** on the aromatic ring:
  - Core structure: aromatic ring with **N-C=O (amide)** and **Br**.
  - The amide group (N-C=O) is directly attached to the aromatic ring, similar to aniline derivatives.
  - From the examples, aniline-like structures (N attached to aromatic) tend to have **~3.40264009** (e.g., `Cc1ccc(N)cc1`, `ClCc1ccccc1`).
  - The Br substituent does not seem to override this trend (as Br alone gives -0.09270983, but the amide/aniline feature dominates).

### Predicted Property:
Given the dominance of the amide/aniline-like structure, the predicted property value is:  
**3.40264009**  

(Note: This matches the trend observed for similar molecules in the dataset.)
==================================================
Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 3.224553167474091
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe patterns in the property values based on molecular structures:

1. Simple alkanes, alcohols, and non-aromatic cyclic compounds (e.g., CC(C)CO, CCCCCCC, OC1CCCCC1) typically have property values of 0.0.

2. Aromatic compounds with simple alkyl substitutions (e.g., Cc1ccccc1N, Cc1cccc2ccccc12) tend to have positive values in the 3.0-3.8 range.

3. The molecule "CCc1ccc(C)cc1" (isopropylbenzene) has a value of -0.06198445, while "CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1" (tert-butylbenzene) has 3.22455317.

The molecule in question is "CC(C)Cc1ccccc1" (isobutylbenzene), which is structurally similar to these examples. It has:
- An aromatic ring
- An isobutyl (branched 4-carbon) substituent

Comparing with similar structures:
- "CCc1ccc(C)cc1" (isopropylbenzene): -0.06198445
- "CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1" (tert-butylbenzene): 3.22455317
- "Cc1cccc2ccccc12" (methylnaphthalene): 3.86775957

The isobutyl group is more similar in bulkiness to tert-butyl than isopropyl, but not as extended as naphthalene. Therefore, I would predict a value intermediate between isopropylbenzene and tert-butylbenzene, but closer to the tert-butyl case since the isobutyl chain has more bulk than isopropyl.

Predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1: 3.22455317

(Note: This matches exactly with the tert-butylbenzene value, suggesting that the property may be more sensitive to the presence of branching near the ring than to the exact length of the alkyl chain)
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I can make the following observations:

1. **Patterns in the data**:
   - Molecules with a **benzene ring** and a **polar substituent** (e.g., -OH, -CHO, -NO₂) often have property values around **-0.09270983** (e.g., `Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1`, `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O`, `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`).
   - Molecules with **aldehyde groups** (e.g., `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O`) also tend to have values close to **-0.09270983**.
   - Simple aromatic aldehydes (like benzaldehyde) are structurally similar to these examples.

2. **Key features of benzaldehyde**:
   - It has a benzene ring with an aldehyde group (-CHO), which is polar and electron-withdrawing.
   - No additional strongly electron-donating or bulky groups are present (which might increase the value, as seen in `CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1` with a value of **3.90608631**).

3. **Comparison with similar molecules**:
   - `NC(=O)c1ccccc1O` (an amide and phenol derivative) has a value of **-0.09270983**.
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (a nitro-substituted benzene) also has **-0.09270983**.
   - The aldehyde group in benzaldehyde is likely to behave similarly in terms of contributing to this property.

### Predicted Property Value for **O=Cc1ccccc1**:
**-0.09270983**  

This aligns with the trend observed for simple aromatic systems with polar substituents.

Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 3.8564812933452846
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)** are present in some molecules, and they often correlate with a property value of **-0.09270983** (e.g., `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2`, `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2`, `Clc1ccccc1`).
2. **Aromatic systems with heteroatoms** (e.g., nitrogen or oxygen) in rings sometimes result in **-0.09270983** (e.g., `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2`).
3. **Amide or urea-like structures** (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`) can lead to negative values (e.g., **-0.94208996**), but this depends on the context.
4. **Complex fused or conjugated systems** with multiple functional groups (e.g., nitro + amide) may retain the **-0.09270983** trend if the nitro group dominates.

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
The structure is:
```
O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2
```
- It contains a **nitro group (N(=O)=O)** attached to an aromatic ring (similar to many examples with **-0.09270983**).
- It also has **two amide-like (C=O)N groups** in a 5-membered ring, but these are part of a larger conjugated system.
- The molecule is not purely aliphatic or simple (like `CCO`, `CC(C)C`, which have **0.0**), nor does it have highly polar or extended conjugation like some high-value examples (e.g., **3.40264009**).

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The nitro-aromatic moiety is strongly reminiscent of molecules like `Clc1ccccc1` or `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2`, which both have **-0.09270983**.
- The additional amide groups might slightly influence the property, but the nitro group's effect seems dominant in the examples.

### Predicted Property:
Given the strong correlation of nitro-aromatic systems with **-0.09270983** in the provided data, the most likely property value for this molecule is:

**-0.09270983**
==================================================
Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2`, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Molecules with simple aromatic rings (e.g., `c1ccccc1`, `Nc1ccccc1`, `Brc1ccccc1`) tend to have the property value `-0.09270983`.
   - This suggests that aromaticity alone is associated with this value unless other functional groups or structural features override it.

2. **Nitrogen-Containing Aromatic Systems**:
   - `Nc1ccccc1` (aniline) has the value `-0.09270983`.
   - `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (a diazo compound) also has `-0.09270983`.

3. **Hydrazine-Linked Aromatics**:
   - The target molecule `N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` is a diphenylhydrazine derivative, where two phenyl groups are linked by a `N-N` bond. This is structurally similar to `N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (a diazo compound), which has the value `-0.09270983`.

4. **No Overriding Features**:
   - The molecule lacks strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups (e.g., nitro, carbonyl, halogens beyond simple substitution) that would significantly alter the property value in the examples.

### Conclusion:
The molecule `N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` is most similar to other simple aromatic systems with nitrogen substitutions, which consistently have the property value `-0.09270983`. The `N-N` linkage does not appear to change this value in the given examples (as seen with the diazo compound).

### Predicted Property Value:

==================================================
Iteration: 50
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -1.4973570159207048
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure (cyclopentane, **CCCC1**). 
   - It is a cyclic diamide (imide) with a 5-membered ring fused to another 5-membered ring (cyclopentane).

2. **Similarity to Examples**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** has a property value of **3.01373065**. This is also a cyclic diamide (imide) with additional alkyl substitutions. The core structure is similar but with more branching.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** is more hydrophobic due to the alkyl chains, which might increase its property value slightly compared to our molecule.
   - **O=C1CCCN1** has a property value of **3.74420298**. This is a simpler lactam (cyclic amide), but our molecule has two amide groups, which could increase polarity and potentially lower the property value compared to this simpler case.
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** has a property value of **3.74420298**. This is also a cyclic diamide but with additional substitutions. Our molecule is less substituted, which might reduce the property value slightly.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - Cyclic diamides/imide structures in the examples tend to have property values in the range of **3.0 to 3.7**.
   - The lack of extensive alkyl substitutions or aromatic rings in our molecule suggests it might be slightly lower than the more substituted examples (e.g., **3.74420298** for **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC**).
   - The presence of the cyclopentane ring (non-aromatic) may slightly reduce the property value compared to aromatic or more polar examples.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarities to cyclic diamides/imide structures and the lack of strongly polar or hydrophobic substituents, the property value is likely close to **3.0**. 

Comparing to **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = **3.01373065**), our molecule is less substituted but retains the cyclic diamide core. Thus, a reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 3.0** (rounded to one decimal place for simplicity; exact value likely between 2.9 and 3.1). 

For precision, I would estimate **3.01373065** (same as the most similar example). 

### Final Answer:
**3.01373065**

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple halogenated aromatics** (e.g., Clc1ccccc1Cl, Ic1ccccc1, Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O) tend to have a property value of **-0.09270983**.
   - These are relatively small, symmetric, and lack complex functional groups.
   - The presence of halogens (Cl, I) or simple substituents (NO2) does not significantly alter the property value in these cases.

2. **Highly halogenated or bulky aromatic systems** (e.g., Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl) have **higher property values** (e.g., 3.40264009).
   - This suggests that increased halogenation or steric bulk increases the property value.

3. **Non-aromatic or aliphatic systems** (e.g., CC(Cl)CCl, CCCCO, CCCCCl) often have a property value of **0.0** unless they contain polar or functionalized groups.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, which is a **dichlorinated biphenyl** with three chlorine atoms total. 
- It is more complex than simple halogenated benzenes (e.g., Clc1ccccc1Cl) but less bulky than highly halogenated systems like Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (which has a value of 3.40264009).
- It resembles a symmetric, moderately halogenated aromatic system.

### Closest Analogues in the Examples:
1. **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene): **-0.09270983**
2. **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (hexachlorinated biphenyl): **3.40264009**

The target molecule is intermediate in complexity between these two. Given its symmetric dichlorinated biphenyl structure, it is likely closer to the dichlorobenzene case but with a slightly higher value due to the additional aromatic ring and chlorine.

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **3.40264009**, as this value appears for similarly halogenated aromatic systems with moderate complexity. The additional aromatic ring and chlorine likely place it in this range.

### Final Answer:
**3.40264009**

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 3.224553167474091
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), we can predict its property value by comparing it to structurally similar molecules in the dataset. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Structural Similarity**:  
   - The molecule is a simple aromatic hydrocarbon with two ethyl substituents on a benzene ring.  
   - Similar molecules in the dataset include:  
     - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene) with a property value of **2.38869558**.  
     - **Cc1ccccc1N** (toluidine) with a property value of **3.40264009**, but this has a polar -NH2 group, making it less comparable.  
     - **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde) with a property value of **-0.09270983**, but this has a polar carbonyl group.  

2. **Key Observations**:  
   - Non-polar aromatic hydrocarbons with alkyl chains (e.g., hexylbenzene) tend to have values around **2.38869558**.  
   - The presence of polar groups (e.g., -NO2, -OH, -NH2) significantly changes the property value.  
   - Diethylbenzene is less hydrophobic/longer than hexylbenzene but more so than toluene (not in the dataset, but simpler).  

3. **Prediction**:  
   - Since diethylbenzene has two shorter alkyl chains (ethyl) compared to hexylbenzene (hexyl), its property value should be slightly lower than **2.38869558** but still in a similar range.  
   - A reasonable estimate is **~2.0**, but looking at the trend, **2.35770279** (seen for **CCC(CC)C=O** and **CCCC(=O)CC**) seems plausible for a mid-sized non-polar molecule.  

**Final Predicted Property Value**: **2.35770279**  

*(This aligns with the trend for non-polar aromatic hydrocarbons with moderate alkyl substitution.)*

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I can identify some patterns in the property values:

1. Simple aliphatic compounds (e.g., C(C)C, ClCBr, CCCCCCCCCCO) tend to have property values of 0.0
2. Aromatic compounds with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) often have property values around 3.4 (e.g., Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O = 3.40264009)
3. Compounds with sulfonyl groups (S(=O)=O) are not directly represented in the examples, but similar electronegative groups show values around -0.09270983
4. The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a value of -0.09270983
5. The structure Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is similar but replaces one nitro group with a sulfonamide group

Given that:
- The sulfonamide group is similarly electronegative to nitro groups
- The aromatic amine (Nc1ccc...) portion is identical to molecules that show -0.09270983
- No strongly positive-contributing features (like fused aromatic systems) are present

The most likely property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is:

-0.09270983

Iteration: 54
SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule, I can make the following observations:

1. The property value appears to be related to molecular symmetry, aromaticity, and halogen substitution patterns.

2. Many simple hydrocarbons (e.g., C1CCCC1, C1CCCCCC1, CCCCC(C)(O)CC) have a property value of 0.0.

3. Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substitutions (especially chlorine) tend to have a value of -0.09270983 (e.g., Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1).

4. The target molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (specifically, a phenanthrene derivative) with no heteroatoms or substituents.

5. Looking at similar structures in the examples:
   - c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 has value 2.61071983
   - Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32 has value 3.20079652
   - c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 has value -0.09270983

The target molecule is most similar to c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 (which has value -0.09270983), but with one fewer ring. Given that simpler aromatic systems tend toward zero and more complex ones have higher absolute values, and considering the symmetry of the target molecule, I would predict a value close to the recurring -0.09270983 pattern seen in other symmetric aromatic systems.

Predicted property value: -0.09270983

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 3.67997357063355
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule, I can attempt to predict the property based on structural features and trends observed in the data. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Key Observations from Examples:**
   - Molecules with **halogens only (Cl, Br, I, F)** or **simple alkanes/ethers** tend to have a property value of **0.0** (e.g., `ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl`, `ClCCl`, `CCOC(C)OCC`).
   - Molecules with **aromatic rings and no strongly polar/delocalized substituents** often have a value around **-0.09270983** (e.g., `Fc1ccccc1`, `o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13`).
   - Molecules with **multiple hydroxyl groups (`-OH`)** or **extended conjugated systems with polar groups** tend to have **higher positive values** (e.g., `Cc1ccc(Cl)cc1` = 3.40264009, `OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5` = 3.97855985).
   - The presence of **carbonyl groups (`C=O`)** and **oxygen heterocycles** also seems to increase the value.

2. **Target Molecule Analysis:**
   The target molecule is:
   ```
   Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
   ```
   - It has **multiple hydroxyl groups (`-OH`)** attached to aromatic rings.
   - It contains a **carbonyl group (`C=O`)** and an **ether linkage (`Oc1c2`)**.
   - The structure is **highly conjugated** with two aromatic rings and a bridging carbonyl/ether system.
   - Similar molecules in the examples with these features (e.g., polyphenols, conjugated carbonyls) have **high positive values** (e.g., 3.40264009, 3.97855985).

3. **Prediction:**
   Given the structural similarity to molecules with values around **3.4–3.9**, and the presence of multiple polar/conjugated features, I predict the property value to be:
   ```
   3.714644
   ```
   (This matches the value for `COc2c1occc1cc3ccc(=O)oc23`, which has a similar conjugated system with oxygen substituents.)

**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value is **3.714644**.

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 3.744202980887865
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple alkanes (e.g., CCCCC, CCCCBr, CCC(C)(O)CC)** typically have a property value of **0.0** unless they have functional groups or branching that introduce polarity or other interactions.
2. **Phosphorus-containing compounds (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl)** tend to have negative property values, often around **-1.38 to -0.09**, depending on substituents.
3. **Compounds with amide or thioamide groups (e.g., NC(=O)c1cccnc1, Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1)** often have values around **-0.09**.
4. **Compounds with nitro groups (e.g., Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O)** have high positive values (**~3.40**).
5. **Compounds with aromatic rings and polar substituents (e.g., Cc1ccc(O)cc1)** can have high positive values if electron-donating groups are present.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, which has:
- A **phosphoryl group (P=O)** with mixed substituents (O, N, S).
- An **amide-like group (NC(C)=O)** attached to phosphorus.
- A **thioether (S-C)** group.

Given the presence of:
- Phosphorus (often associated with negative values).
- Amide (moderate influence, often around -0.09).
- Thioether (less clear, but sulfur can contribute to negative values).

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = **-1.38003182** (phosphorothioate with aromatic chlorides).
- **COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property = **0.68041532** (phosphodiester with chlorides).
- **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**: Property = **-1.60709262** (phosphorodithioate with amide).

The target molecule is a **phosphoramidothioate** (mixed P=O, P-N, and P-S bonds), which is somewhat similar to the above examples but simpler. The amide and thioether groups suggest a moderately negative value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to phosphorus-containing compounds with negative values and the absence of strongly electron-donating groups, a reasonable prediction is:  
**-1.38** (similar to other phosphoryl compounds with mixed substituents).

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** is **-1.38003182**.

Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns in the property values:

1. Simple alkanes (e.g., CC1CCCC1, CCCC(C)C) and simple alcohols/ethers (e.g., CCCCO, CCCCOCCO) typically have a property value of 0.0.

2. Molecules with conjugated systems or aromatic rings often have values around -0.09270983 (e.g., c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, Nc1cccc2ccccc12).

3. Molecules with polar functional groups like carbonyls (C=O) or nitro groups (NO2) tend to have higher positive values (e.g., CCCC(=O)C at 3.64730687, Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O at 3.40264009).

4. Halogenated compounds (Cl, Br) often have values of 0.0 or -0.09270983 unless combined with other functional groups.

The molecule in question is Cl\C=C/Cl (1,2-dichloroethene). This is a simple halogenated alkene with no additional functional groups or conjugation beyond the C=C bond. 

Comparing to similar structures in the examples:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (hexachlorobenzene derivative) has -0.09270983
- CCBr has 0.0
- Simple alkenes like CCC=O have -0.03107967

Given that our molecule is more similar to simple halogenated compounds than to conjugated systems, and lacks any additional functional groups that would increase the value, the most reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 0.0**

Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations:
1. **Aromatic systems with nitrogen (N) in the ring** tend to have higher property values, especially when N is part of the aromatic system (e.g., pyridine-like structures). Examples:
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1**: 3.93839584 (contains aromatic N and amide)
   - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2**: 3.67997357 (aromatic N and amide)
   - **CNc1ccccc1**: 3.40264009 (aromatic N attached to methyl)
   - **COc5cc4OCC3Oc2c1CC(Oc1ccc2C(=O)C3c4cc5OC)C(C)=C**: 0.67449076 (no aromatic N)
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2**: 3.40264009 (multiple aromatic N atoms)

2. **Simple aromatic hydrocarbons without heteroatoms** (e.g., benzene, polyaromatics) tend to have values close to **-0.09270983** or **0.0**:
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43**: -0.09270983 (polyaromatic)
   - **c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1**: -0.09270983 (polyaromatic)

3. **Pyridine (c1ccncc1)** is a simple aromatic heterocycle with one nitrogen. It lacks additional functional groups (like amides or nitro groups) that could further increase the property value. 

### Comparison:
- The molecule **CNc1ccccc1** (methylaniline) has a value of **3.40264009**, but it has an extra methyl group attached to the nitrogen.
- **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (a complex N-heterocycle) also has a value of **3.40264009**.
- **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (a fused N-heterocycle) has a value of **-0.09270983**, but this is likely due to its polyaromatic nature dominating over the N contribution.

### Prediction:
Since **pyridine (c1ccncc1)** is a simple aromatic N-heterocycle without additional functional groups, its value should be **lower than 3.40264009** but higher than simple hydrocarbons (-0.09270983). 

A reasonable estimate is **~3.0**, but looking at the examples, the simplest N-containing aromatics (like **CNc1ccccc1**) tend to cluster around **3.40264009**. Since pyridine is even simpler (no substituents), I'd predict a slightly lower value.

However, the examples suggest that **aromatic N alone** (even without substituents) often gives values close to **3.40264009**. Thus, the most consistent prediction is:

**Predicted property value for c1ccncc1: 3.40264009**

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 2.822496293632006
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic systems with substitutions** (e.g., halogens, nitro groups, or polar groups) often have property values around **3.4–3.8** (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1Cl` = 3.40264009, `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1` = 3.86775957).
2. **Polar or hydrogen-bonding groups** (e.g., hydroxyl, carbonyl, or amine) can increase the property value if they are part of an aromatic system (e.g., `Cc1cccc(O)c1` = 3.40264009).
3. **Chlorine substitutions on aromatic rings** tend to contribute to higher values (e.g., `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` = -0.09270983 is an exception, but `Cc1ccccc1Cl` = 3.40264009).
4. **Amide or ester linkages in aromatic systems** often result in values around **1.5–2.4** (e.g., `CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2` = 1.51809284, `CC(=O)N` = 2.38869558).
5. **Complex fused aromatic systems** with no polar substitutions tend to have values around **-0.09270983**.

### Analysis of the Given Molecule:
The molecule has:
- A **polar glycol ether chain (OCC(O)CO–)** attached to an **ester (C(=O))**, which is linked to a **benzene ring**.
- The benzene ring is further connected to an **aniline (Nc2ccnc3...)** with a **chlorine substitution** on a fused aromatic system (likely a quinoline or similar structure).
- The presence of **Cl**, **N**, **O**, and **ester/carbonyl groups** suggests moderate to high polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analogs are molecules like:
  - `CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2` (1.51809284) – similar ester-linked aromatic system with polar groups.
  - `Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (3.86775957) – fused aromatic system with substitutions.
  - `Cc1ccccc1Cl` (3.40264009) – aromatic + Cl substitution.

Given the **ester linkage**, **fused aromatic system with Cl**, and **polar side chain**, the property value is likely in the **higher range (1.5–3.8)**. The glycol ether side chain may slightly reduce the value compared to purely aromatic systems, but the Cl and N contributions push it higher.

### Predicted Value:
A reasonable estimate is **1.51809284**, matching the ester-linked aromatic system with polar substitutions.

**Final Answer:**  
**1.51809284**

Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alcohols with No Functional Groups or Simple Terminal -OH:**
   - **CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1**: 3.90608631 (branched alkane with aromatic ring)
   - **CCCc1ccccc1**: -0.06198445 (linear alkane with aromatic ring)
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O**: 0.0 (branched alcohol)
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1**: 0.0 (cyclic alcohol)
   - **CCCCCCCI**: 0.0 (linear alkyl halide)
   - **CCC(C)Cl**: 0.0 (branched alkyl halide)
   - **C1CCC2CCCCC2C1**: 0.0 (bicyclic alkane, no functional groups)

   These examples suggest that simple alkanes or alcohols with no strongly polar or aromatic features tend to have property values close to **0.0**.

2. **Linear Alcohols:**
   - **CCCCCO** is a linear alcohol (1-pentanol), similar to **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tertiary alcohol) and **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cyclic alcohol), both of which have a property value of **0.0**.

3. **Functional Groups and Property Trends:**
   - The presence of aromatic rings, halogens, or other functional groups tends to shift the property value away from 0.0 (either positive or negative).
   - **CCCCCO** has no aromaticity or other functional groups besides the terminal -OH, so it should behave similarly to other simple alcohols.

### Prediction:
Given that **CCCCCO** is a simple linear alcohol with no additional functional groups or aromaticity, its property value is most likely **0.0**, consistent with other simple alcohols in the dataset.

### Final Answer:
**0.0**

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: -1.3800318216428353
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the target molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**, let's break down the structural features and correlate them with the property values from the training data:

### Key Observations from Training Data:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Heteroatoms (e.g., N, O, S, Halogens)**:
   - Many molecules with aromatic rings (especially those with substitutions like halogens, -OH, -NH₂) have a property value of **-0.09270983**. Examples:
     - `Sc2nc1ccccc1s2` → -0.09270983  
     - `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` → -0.09270983  
     - `Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2` → -0.09270983  
     - `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` → -0.09270983  
     - `c1ccncc1` → -0.09270983  

2. **Aliphatic Chains or Non-Aromatic Functional Groups**:
   - Molecules with aliphatic chains, carbonyls (C=O), or non-aromatic heterocycles tend to deviate from -0.09270983. Examples:
     - `CCCC(=O)CCC` → 1.11974769  
     - `CC/C=C/C` → -1.64332116  
     - `CCC(Br)(CC)C(=O)NC(N)=O` → 2.43485121  

3. **Sulfonyl Groups (S=O)**:
   - The presence of sulfonyl groups (`S(=O)(=O)`) is rare in the training data, but similar polar groups (e.g., phosphates, carbonyls) often lead to intermediate values (e.g., 0.64675032 for `CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C`).

4. **Fused or Complex Heterocycles**:
   - The target molecule has a fused heterocycle (benzene + 5-membered ring with S=O and O), which is somewhat analogous to `Sc2nc1ccccc1s2` (property = -0.09270983). However, the sulfonyl group and additional aliphatic chain (`CCO`) may perturb this.

### Target Molecule Analysis:
- **Structure**: `CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1`  
  - Contains a benzene ring (`c2ccccc2`) substituted with -NH- and C=O (amide-like).  
  - Fused to a 5-membered ring with S=O (sulfonyl) and an aliphatic ether (`CCO`).  
  - Methyl group (`CC`) attached to the heterocycle.  

- **Analogies**:
  - The aromatic part resembles `Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2` (-0.09270983), but the sulfonyl and aliphatic chain are disruptive.  
  - The sulfonyl group is somewhat like `CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (property = 3.22455317), but that molecule also has a nitro group, which is absent here.  

### Prediction:
Given the aromatic core (contributing -0.09270983) but with significant perturbations from the sulfonyl and aliphatic ether (likely pushing the value toward intermediate ranges), the property value is **most likely close to 0.64675032** (similar to sulfonyl-containing molecules in the training data).

**Predicted property value: 0.64675032**

   - The nitro group tends to increase the property value when attached to an aromatic ring, especially if it's the only substituent (as in the first example).

2. **Ester groups (C(=O)OC)**:
   - Examples with ester groups:
     - `CCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC` has a value of **-0.03107967**.
     - `CCCCC(=O)OC` has a value of **2.35770279**.
   - Esters can contribute positively or negatively depending on the context. Here, the ester is part of a more complex system.

3. **Fused ring system with nitrogen (NC=)**:
   - Similar to `c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2` (pyrrole-like) which has a value of **-0.09270983**, but this is a more complex system.

4. **Substituted aromatic ring (c2ccccc2)**:
   - Examples with substituted aromatic rings:
     - `CC(C)c1ccccc1C` has a value of **3.22455317**.
     - `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13` (naphthalene) has a value of **3.54432998**.
   - Aromatic systems with substitutions often have positive values.

5. **Overall complexity**:
   - The molecule is complex with multiple functional groups (nitro, ester, aromatic, nitrogen heterocycle). The nitro group on the aromatic ring is likely the dominant feature.

### Comparison to closest examples:
- The nitro-aromatic `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has a value of **3.40264009**.
- The presence of the ester and nitrogen heterocycle may slightly modulate this value, but the nitro group is the primary driver.

### Predicted value:
Given the dominance of the nitro-aromatic feature and the similarity to `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`, the predicted value is likely close to **3.4**. 

However, the additional complexity (ester and heterocycle) might slightly reduce this. A reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 3.22455317**  
*(This matches the value for `CC(C)c1ccccc1C` and `CC(C)(C)c1ccc(O)cc1`, which are similarly complex aromatic systems with significant substituents.)*

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 2.388695575492197
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). It is a cyclic diamide (imide) structure, resembling a diketopiperazine or a similar heterocycle.
2. **Polarity**: The presence of multiple polar amide groups suggests moderate polarity.
3. **Symmetry**: The molecule is symmetric, which often correlates with specific property values in the dataset (e.g., symmetric molecules like **Clc1cccc(I)c1** or **c1ccncc1** have a value of **-0.09270983**).
4. **Aromaticity**: No aromatic rings are present, but the cyclic amide structure may influence the property similarly to aromatic systems in some cases.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Symmetric cyclic structures** (e.g., **c1ccncc1**, **Clc1cccc(I)c1**, **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32**) consistently have the property value **-0.09270983**.
- **Non-symmetric polar molecules** (e.g., **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**) have higher values (e.g., **3.03675432**), but these are larger and more complex.
- The given molecule is small, symmetric, and contains polar amide groups, similar to symmetric aromatic systems in the dataset.

### Prediction:
Given the symmetry and the presence of polar amide groups, the property value is most likely **-0.09270983**, as this value appears repeatedly for small, symmetric, and polar/aromatic systems in the dataset.

### Final Answer:
**-0.09270983**
==================================================
Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe certain trends in the property values based on molecular structure:

1. **Simple alkanes** (e.g., `CCCCC`, `CCC1CCCCC1`) tend to have a property value of **0.0**.
2. **Chlorinated simple hydrocarbons** (e.g., `Clc1ccccc1`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`) tend to have a property value of **-0.09270983**.
3. **Small chlorinated alkanes** (e.g., `ClCC`) are not explicitly listed, but structurally, they are simpler than aromatic chlorinated compounds (which have the value -0.09270983). 

Since `ClCC` is a small, non-aromatic chlorinated alkane (chloroethane), it is reasonable to assign it the same property value as other simple chlorinated hydrocarbons, which is **-0.09270983**. 

### Predicted property value for `ClCC`: **-0.09270983**
==================================================
Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 2.4195112174048843
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, we can observe the following patterns:

1. **Aromatic systems** (especially those with halogens or nitro groups) tend to have a property value of **-0.09270983**. Examples include:
   - `Oc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2` → -0.09270983  
   - `c1ccc2c(c1)sc3ccccc23` → -0.09270983  
   - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` → -0.09270983  
   - `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl` → -0.09270983  

2. **Highly halogenated aliphatic systems** (e.g., CCl4-like structures) tend to have a property value of **0.0**. Examples include:
   - `ClCC(Cl)Cl` → 0.0  
   - `ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C4(Cl)C5(Cl)C1(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl` → 0.0  

3. **Complex or polar functional groups** (e.g., amides, esters, nitro groups, or sulfonamides) tend to have **positive values**, often in the range of **2.0–4.0**.  

### Target Molecule: `Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`  
- This is an **aromatic system** (pyridine ring with chlorine substituents) with a **CCl3 group** attached.  
- The aromatic component (especially with halogens) strongly suggests the **-0.09270983** pattern.  
- The **CCl3 group** alone might suggest **0.0**, but the aromatic influence dominates in similar examples (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` has a different value, but simpler halogenated aromatics consistently show **-0.09270983**).  

### Predicted Property Value:  
**-0.09270983** (matching the trend for halogenated aromatic systems).
==================================================
Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for molecules with a simple aliphatic alcohol structure (e.g., `CCCC(O)CCC`, `CCC(C)CCO`, `CCC(CC)CO`) is consistently **0.0**. 

The molecule `CCCCC(C)O` fits this pattern, as it is a branched aliphatic alcohol (specifically, 2-hexanol). There are no functional groups or structural features in this molecule that would deviate from the trend observed in the examples (e.g., no aromatic rings, halogens, or other polar substituents that might influence the property).

Thus, the predicted property value for `CCCCC(C)O` is:  
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 67
SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can identify patterns in the property values associated with different molecular structures. 

For the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), we can observe the following trends from the examples:

1. **Halogenated aromatic compounds** (especially with Cl or Br) often have property values around **-0.09270983** when they are simple substituted benzenes without additional functional groups. Examples:
   - Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl → -0.09270983  
   - O=N(=O)c1c(Cl)c(Cl)ccc1 → -0.09270983  
   - ClC(=C)Cl → -0.09270983  

2. The presence of **two bromine atoms** (Br) in a symmetric aromatic system (like para-substitution in benzene) is structurally similar to the dichlorobenzene examples, which consistently show **-0.09270983**.

3. No additional functional groups (like -OH, -NO₂, -S=O, etc.) are present to modify this baseline value.

### Predicted Property Value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1**:  
**-0.09270983**  

This matches the trend observed for simple halogenated aromatic systems in the given dataset.

Iteration: 68
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I can analyze the patterns in the molecular structures and their associated property values to predict the property for the new molecule: 

**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds** (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls or similar structures) tend to have a property value of **-0.09270983**. For example:
   - `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` → **-0.09270983**
   - `c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45` (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) → **-0.09270983**
   - `O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12` (a nitro-substituted polycyclic aromatic) → **-0.09270983**

2. The new molecule is a **polychlorinated biphenyl-like structure** (two chlorinated benzene rings linked together), which is very similar to the first example above. The only difference is the substitution pattern of the chlorines, but the overall scaffold and high chlorine content are identical in nature.

3. Other highly symmetric or conjugated systems (e.g., polyaromatics or systems with extended π-electron delocalization) also tend to have this value.

### Prediction:
Since the new molecule is a **polychlorinated biphenyl derivative**, its property value is very likely the same as the other highly chlorinated aromatic examples. 

### Final Answer:
**-0.09270983**

Iteration: 69
SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 3.4026400880786185
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains three aromatic rings (two substituted phenyl rings and one central phenyl ring).
2. **Phosphate group (OP(=O)(O...))**: This is a polar and ionizable group, which can significantly influence the property.
3. **Methyl substituents (C)**: The aromatic rings are substituted with methyl groups, which are hydrophobic.
4. **Ether linkages (Oc2... and Oc3...)**: These are polar but not ionizable.

### Comparison with Examples:
- Molecules with **phosphate groups** (e.g., `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O`) tend to have high property values (e.g., 3.93839584).
- Molecules with **multiple aromatic rings and polar groups** (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C`) also have high values (e.g., 3.22455317).
- The presence of **methyl groups** does not significantly lower the property (e.g., `CC1CC2C3CCC(O)(C(=O)C)C3(C)CC(O)C2(F)C4(C)C=CC(=O)C=C14` has a value of 3.01373065).

### Prediction:
Given the **phosphate group** (highly polar/ionizable) and **multiple aromatic rings**, this molecule is likely to have a **high property value**, similar to other phosphate-containing or multi-aromatic compounds in the examples. 

Looking at the range:
- Phosphate-containing molecules: ~3.9 to ~3.2.
- Multi-aromatic molecules: ~3.0 to ~3.9.

The molecule here is more complex than most examples, with three aromatic rings and a phosphate group, so the value should be on the higher end. 

### Predicted Property Value:
**3.7** (approximate, likely between 3.6 and 3.9 based on similar examples). 

A more precise estimate would be **3.8**, given the strong influence of the phosphate group. 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**3.8** (rounded to one decimal place for simplicity). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend observed in the given examples where polar/ionizable groups and aromaticity correlate with higher values.)

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 3.729609603129654
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key structural features of the molecule:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: This is a highly electronegative and electron-withdrawing group, which often increases the property value (as seen in molecules like `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` with a value of 3.40264009).
2. **Aromatic ring with substitution**: The presence of a benzene ring substituted with an electron-withdrawing group (CF3) and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O) suggests potential for higher property values.
3. **Chlorine atoms (Cl)**: Chlorine substituents are present in the heterocyclic part of the molecule. In the examples, chlorine often appears in molecules with higher property values (e.g., `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` with 3.40264009).
4. **Ketone group (C=O)**: This is another electron-withdrawing group, which may contribute to increasing the property value.

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- The molecule `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` has a value of **3.40264009**, and it contains strong electron-withdrawing groups (sulfonamide and chlorine).
- The molecule `ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2` also has a value of **3.40264009**, with multiple chlorines and aromatic rings.
- The molecule `Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O` has a value of **3.40264009**, featuring nitro groups (strong electron-withdrawing).

Given the presence of **CF3, Cl, and C=O** in the query molecule, it is reasonable to predict a similar property value to these examples.

### Predicted property value:
**3.40264009** (same as the examples with strong electron-withdrawing groups and chlorine substituents). 

This is based on the observation that molecules with multiple electron-withdrawing groups (especially nitro, sulfonamide, or CF3) and chlorine substituents tend to cluster around this value in the provided data.

Iteration: 71
SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 3.4026400880786185
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's break down the structural features that seem to correlate with the property values:

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**:
   - Molecules with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`, `c1ccccc1O`) tend to have a property value of **-0.09270983**.
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing and appears to consistently correlate with this value when attached to an aromatic system.

2. **Methoxy group (OCH3)**:
   - The methoxy group (e.g., `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O`) is electron-donating but does not seem to significantly alter the property when combined with a nitro group on the same aromatic ring. For example, `c1ccccc1O` (phenol) also has the value **-0.09270983**, suggesting the substituent type (OH vs. OCH3) may not drastically change the property in this context.

3. **Aromatic systems**:
   - Simple aromatic systems with substituents like nitro or hydroxyl groups often have the value **-0.09270983** (e.g., `c1ccccc1O`, `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`).

### Prediction:
The molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (methoxy-nitrobenzene) has:
- A nitro group attached to an aromatic ring.
- A methoxy group on the same ring, which is structurally similar to the examples where the property is **-0.09270983**.

No other conflicting functional groups or structural features are present that would suggest a deviation from this value.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is **-0.09270983**.

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 3.6473068695658277
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and symmetry. The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated polycyclic structure, resembling a chlorinated hydrocarbon cage (e.g., a derivative of hexachloronorbornane or similar). 

From the examples:
- Simple halogenated alkanes (e.g., ClCCCl, CCCCl, BrC(Br)Br) have a property value of **0.0**.
- Highly symmetric or saturated halogenated structures (e.g., ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl) also have a value of **0.0**.
- More complex or unsaturated halogenated structures (e.g., ClCC#N, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1) deviate from 0.0, but symmetric cages tend to revert to 0.0.

The given molecule is a fully chlorinated, symmetric cage-like structure with no unsaturation or polar functional groups beyond the Cl atoms. Thus, it closely resembles the examples where the property value is **0.0**.

### Predicted property value: **0.0**.
==================================================
Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 3.744202980887865
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), let's break down the reasoning for predicting its property value:

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Halogenated Alkanes**: 
   - Molecules like `C1CCCCCC1` (cyclohexane), `CC(Cl)Cl`, `CC(Cl)CCl`, `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (hexachlorocyclohexane), and `CCCC(O)CC` (simple alkanes/alkanols) have a property value of **0.0**. This suggests that saturated hydrocarbons or heavily halogenated alkanes tend to have neutral (0.0) property values.

2. **Esters and Carbonyl-Containing Compounds**:
   - `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate) has a value of **-0.41550918**.
   - `CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2` (a more complex ester) has a value of **-0.94208996**.
   - Esters generally seem to have negative property values, with simpler esters being less negative than more complex ones.

3. **Aldehydes/Ketones**:
   - `CC(=O)CCC1C(=O)N(N(C1=O)c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (a diketone) has a value of **0.13827594**.
   - The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) doesn't always lead to negative values, but in esters, it tends to be negative.

4. **Simple Alcohols/Ethers**:
   - `CC(O)c1ccccc1` (phenylethanol) has a value of **-1.38003182**, but this is likely due to the aromatic ring + hydroxyl combination.
   - `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` (sorbitol) has a value of **0.0**, suggesting polyols are neutral.

### Analysis of **CCCOC=O** (Propyl Formate):
- This is a simple ester (formate ester with a propyl group). 
- Compared to `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (ethyl ester with an aromatic ring and amine, value = -0.41550918), propyl formate is simpler (no aromaticity or additional functional groups).
- The ester group (C=O) suggests a negative value, but the simplicity (no aromaticity or other polar groups) likely makes it less negative than the examples with aromatic rings or multiple functional groups.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends:
- Simple esters without aromaticity or additional functional groups are likely in the range of **-0.3 to -0.5**.
- The closest analog is `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (-0.41550918), but propyl formate is simpler, so it might be slightly less negative.

**Predicted value for CCCOC=O: -0.35** (approximate, based on the trend of simple esters). 

However, looking back at the examples, the simplest ester-like molecule with a value is `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (-0.41550918). Since propyl formate is even simpler, a reasonable estimate would be slightly less negative, but no simpler ester examples are given. 

Given the lack of exact matches, the safest bet is to assign a value close to the simplest ester example:  
**Final predicted value: -0.4** (rounded from -0.41550918 for consistency with the trend). 

But since the question asks for a specific value from the examples, the closest match is **-0.41550918** (from `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1`), even though propyl formate is simpler. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCOC=O** is:  
**-0.41550918** (matching the simplest ester example provided). 

However, if we consider that propyl formate is simpler than the ethyl ester example, a slightly less negative value like **-0.3** might be more accurate, but this is speculative. 

Given the instructions to use only the provided examples, the most defensible answer is:  
**-0.41550918** (same as the simplest ester example). 

But since the ethyl ester example includes an aromatic ring and amine (which likely contribute to the negative value), propyl formate should be less negative. A better estimate might be **-0.27** (similar to the second example, which is a complex molecule with multiple ether/ester groups). 

Given the ambiguity, the most conservative answer is:  
**-0.27** (similar to the complex ether/ester example, as propyl formate is a simple ester). 

However, the first ester example is more directly comparable, so:  
**Final answer: -0.41550918**. 

(Note: Without a clear definition of the property, this is an educated guess based on the given examples. The property could be a computed or experimental value like logP, dipole moment, etc., but the exact nature isn't specified.) 

Given the instructions, the predicted value for **CCCOC=O** is:  
**-0.41550918**. 

But recognizing that this is likely too negative for such a simple ester, a more reasonable prediction is:  
**-0.3**. 

Given the examples, the closest match is **-0.41550918**, so:  
**Predicted value: -0.41550918**. 

(If the property is something like "electronegativity contribution" or "dipole moment contribution," this might make sense. For logP, esters are usually slightly negative, but not this much. Given the ambiguity, sticking to the closest example is safest.) 

Thus:  
**Predicted property value for CCCOC=O: -0.41550918**. 

However, if we average the ester-like examples:  
- `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1`: -0.41550918  
- `CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2`: -0.94208996  
- `CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2`: -1.59625447  

The simplest ester is -0.41550918, so propyl formate is likely close to this. 

**Final answer: -0.41550918**. 

(Note: This is a rough estimate based on limited examples. For a more accurate prediction, the actual property being predicted would need to be defined.) 

Given the constraints, the predicted value is:  
**-0.41550918**. 

But since propyl formate is simpler, a value of **-0.3** might be more realistic. Given the examples, the answer is:  
**-0.41550918**. 

(If the property is something like "partial charge on carbonyl oxygen," this could make sense. Without more context, this is the best guess.) 

**Final prediction: -0.41550918**. 

---

After reconsidering, the simplest ester example is `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (-0.41550918), and propyl formate is even simpler, so its value should be less negative. The next closest neutral value is 0.0 (for alkanes), so interpolating:  

Propyl formate is between `C1CCCCCC1` (0.0) and `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1` (-0.41550918), so perhaps **-0.2**. 

But since no examples are in this range, the closest is **-0.27** (from the second example, which is complex). 

Given the uncertainty, the most defensible answer is:  
**-0.27**. 

But the first ester example is more directly relevant, so:  
**-0.41550918**. 

Given the instructions, the answer is:  
**Predicted value for CCCOC=O: -0.41550918**. 

---

**Final Answer:**  
Based on the provided examples, the predicted property value for **CCCOC=O** is **-0.41550918**.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -1.4092180463757606
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes**: 
   - **CC** (ethane): 0.0  
   - **CCI** (iodoethane): 0.0  
   - **CC(C)I** (2-iodopropane): 0.0

   - **CCCC=C(CC)C=O** (unsaturated aldehyde): -1.49735702  

   Simple hydrocarbons or halogenated hydrocarbons tend to have property values of **0.0** or close to it unless they have additional functional groups.

2. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - **c1ccccc1** (benzene): Not directly given, but substituted benzenes vary widely.  
   - **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (methylnaphthalene): 3.86775957  
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32** (anthracene/phenanthrene-like): -0.09270983  

   Aromaticity alone doesn't seem to strongly correlate with high or low values unless combined with other features.

3. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**: 3.85648129 (complex heterocycle with multiple polar groups)  
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)C**: 2.38869558 (cyclic imide)  
   - **OCC(O)C(O)CO** (glycerol-like): 0.0 (highly polar but small)  
   - **COc1ccccc1** (anisole): -1.38003182 (ether + aromatic)  

   Carbonyl groups (esters, amides, aldehydes) often increase the property value, especially in complex or conjugated systems.

4. **Esters**:
   - **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C**: 3.66382155 (complex ester with aromatic)  
   - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**: 2.38869558 (alkylbenzene)  
   - **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: 1.11974769 (steroid-like with ketone)  

   Esters tend to have moderate to high values, especially if combined with aromaticity or long alkyl chains.

### Analysis of **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is **decyl acetate** (CH₃(CH₂)₈COOCH₂CH₃), a long-chain ester.
- It has:
  - A long aliphatic chain (CCCCCCCCC).
  - An ester group (COO) with an ethyl group (OCC).
- Similar examples:
  - **COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C**: 3.66382155 (complex ester with aromatic, higher value).  
  - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**: 2.38869558 (alkylbenzene, simpler but somewhat comparable).  
  - **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: 1.11974769 (steroid-like, less directly comparable).  

Given that this is a simple long-chain ester without aromaticity or additional polar groups, its value is likely **lower than complex esters but higher than simple alkanes**. 

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate is **~1.5 to 2.5**. Given the examples, I predict:  
**2.0** (rounded from likely trends).  

However, looking closely at **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (heptylbenzene) with a value of **2.38869558**, this molecule is somewhat similar but lacks the ester. The ester group here would likely increase the value slightly, but the long aliphatic chain may offset this.  

Thus, a more precise prediction is:  
**2.38869558** (same as heptylbenzene, as the ester and alkyl chain effects may balance out).  

But since esters in the examples tend to be higher, I'll adjust slightly upward:  
**2.5**.  

However, to match the precision of the given examples, I'll select the closest example value, which is **2.38869558**.  

### Final Answer:
**2.38869558**
==================================================
Iteration: 75
SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol-like core (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)**: 
   - Similar to **COc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 3.40264009) and **Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (property = -0.09270983).
   - The presence of a phenol (OH) and chloro substituents suggests some polarity and potential for higher property values.

2. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: 
   - Seen in **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property = 3.67997357) and **NC(=O)c1ccccc1** (property = -0.09270983).
   - The amide group is polar and can increase the property value when combined with other polar/electron-withdrawing groups.

3. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: 
   - Seen in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = -0.09270983) and **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** (property = -0.09270983).
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing but does not always correlate with higher property values in isolation.

4. **Chloro substituents (Cl)**: 
   - Present in many examples, e.g., **COc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 3.40264009) and **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 3.78308651).
   - Chloro groups often increase the property value when combined with other polar features.

5. **Overall polarity and size**: 
   - The molecule is larger and more polar than simple aromatics (e.g., **c1ccccc1**, property = -0.09270983) but less complex than some high-property examples like **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4=O** (property = 3.87189164).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analogs are:
  - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property = 3.67997357): Similar amide + phenol + chloro.
  - **COc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 3.40264009): Simpler but with phenol + chloro.
  - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = 3.78308651): Similar amide + chloro but with additional phosphorothioate.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of phenol, amide, chloro, and nitro groups, the property value is likely in the range of **3.4 to 3.8**. The nitro group may slightly offset the increase from the other polar groups, so we predict a value closer to the lower end of this range.

### Final Prediction:
**3.5** (specific value: **3.50000000**)
==================================================
Iteration: 76
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: -1.3800318216428353
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Property = 0.0**: 
   - Molecules with simple aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCCCCCCC`, `CCCC(C)O`, `CCCO`), no aromatic rings, and no polar or electronegative substituents (e.g., `CBr`, `CCSSCC`, `ClCCCCl`).
   - Halogenated aliphatic compounds (e.g., `FC(F)(Cl)C(F)(F)Cl`) also tend to have property = 0.0 unless conjugated with aromatic systems.

2. **Property ≈ -0.09270983**: 
   - Aromatic rings (e.g., `c1ccccc1`, `C=Cc1ccccc1`) or halogenated aromatic rings (e.g., `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl`, `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`).
   - Heteroaromatic systems (e.g., `c2ccc1ocnc1c2`) also fall into this category unless they have additional polar substituents.

3. **Property ≈ 3.7–4.0**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings + polar/electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1` = 3.783, `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` = 3.856).
   - Phosphorothioate groups (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` = 3.783).

4. **Property ≈ 2.8–3.5**: 
   - Aromatic systems with moderate polar substituents (e.g., `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl` = 2.886, `CC(=O)CC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2c(O)c3ccccc3oc2=O` = 2.822).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule is:  
**COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**

- It contains **two aromatic rings** linked by a **thioether (S)** bridge.
- Each aromatic ring is substituted with a **phosphorothioate group (OP(=S)(OC)OC)**, which is highly polar and electron-withdrawing.
- The presence of **two phosphorothioate groups** (similar to `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1`, which has property = 3.783) suggests a high property value.

### Prediction:
Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the phosphorothioate groups and their conjugation with aromatic systems, the property value is likely in the **higher range (≈3.7–4.0)**. 

Comparing with the most similar example:  
`COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a property of **3.78308651**.  

The target molecule has **two phosphorothioate groups** (instead of one) and a **thioether linker**, which may slightly increase the property value due to enhanced conjugation and polarity.

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 3.85** (slightly higher than 3.783 due to the second phosphorothioate group).
==================================================
Iteration: 77
SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Rings with Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O):**
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has a property value of **3.40264009**.
   - This suggests that the presence of a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring tends to result in a property value around **3.4**.

2. **Hydroxy Groups (OH) on Aromatic Rings:**
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** has a property value of **-0.09270983**, but this also includes an amide group, which may lower the value.
   - **Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** has a value of **-0.09270983**, but this is heavily chlorinated, which seems to anchor the value to **-0.0927** (a common value for many chlorinated/uncharged aromatic systems).

3. **Combination of OH and NO2 on Aromatic Rings:**
   - The molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** has both a hydroxy group and a nitro group on the same aromatic ring. This is similar to **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (property = 3.40264009), but with an OH instead of a methyl group.
   - The OH group is electron-donating, while the NO2 group is electron-withdrawing. This push-pull effect may slightly alter the property, but the nitro group's influence is likely dominant.

4. **Other Nitro-Containing Molecules:**
   - **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** has a value of **-0.09270983**, but this is likely due to the chlorines overriding the nitro group's effect.
   - The nitro group alone (without competing effects) seems to result in values around **3.4**.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Nitro-aromatics without strong competing effects (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**) have values around **3.40264009**,
- The OH group in **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is not expected to drastically reduce this value (unlike chlorines or amides),

The most reasonable prediction for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is:

**3.40264009** (same as **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**). 

### Final Answer:
**3.40264009**
==================================================
Iteration: 78
SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and presence of polar or charged groups. The property appears to be influenced by:

1. **Highly halogenated or aromatic systems**: Often have values around **-0.09270983** (e.g., polychlorinated benzenes, polycyclic aromatics).
2. **Simple alkanes or non-polar molecules**: Tend to have a value of **0.0** (e.g., long alkanes like C24H50 or C16H34).
3. **Polar or functionalized molecules**: Can range widely, with highly oxygenated or nitrogenated structures showing positive or negative values (e.g., sugars, amides, esters).
4. **Conjugated or unsaturated systems**: May have values like **-0.03107967** (e.g., nitriles, alkynes).

The molecule in question is a **complex sugar derivative** (likely a oligosaccharide or glycoside) with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages:
```
OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
```
Key observations:
- It is highly oxygenated with many hydroxyl (-OH) and ether (-O-) groups.
- It lacks aromaticity, halogens, or charged groups.
- Structurally, it resembles **C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** (a simple sugar), which has a property value of **0.0**.

Given the absence of features that typically shift the property away from zero (e.g., no halogens, no aromaticity, no charged groups), and the similarity to other polyol/sugar-like structures with **0.0**, the predicted property value is:

**Predicted property value: 0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 2.388695575492197
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkanes and Simple Alcohols/Ethers**:
   - Molecules like **CCCC(O)CCC** (heptanol-like) and **CCOC(C)OCC** (diether) have a property value of **0.0**. These are saturated hydrocarbons or simple ethers/alcohols with no strong functional groups.
   - **CC(C)OC(C)C** (ether) also has **0.0**.

2. **Alkenes and Alkynes**:
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene) has a high value of **3.64730687**.
   - **CCC#C** (1-butyne) is analogous to an alkyne, similar to the alkene above but with a triple bond. Triple bonds (like double bonds) are unsaturated and may contribute similarly to the property.

3. **Aromatic Systems**:
   - Simple unsubstituted aromatics (e.g., **c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3ccccc32**) have a value of **-0.09270983**.
   - Substituted aromatics vary widely depending on the substituents.

4. **Polar or Functionalized Groups**:
   - Carbonyls (C=O) often increase the value (e.g., **CCCC(=O)C** has **3.64730687**).
   - Nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**) can give **-0.09270983** or **3.40264009** depending on context.
   - Halogens (Cl, F, etc.) often give **-0.09270983** unless combined with other features.

### Prediction for **CCC#C**:
- **CCC#C** is a terminal alkyne (unsaturated hydrocarbon with a triple bond). 
- The closest analog in the examples is **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene, property = **3.64730687**), which is an unsaturated hydrocarbon with a double bond. 
- Alkynes are similarly unsaturated, and the triple bond is likely to contribute comparably or slightly more to the property than a double bond. 
- There are no conflicting functional groups to lower the value.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCC#C** is likely similar to that of **CCCCCCCCC=C**, i.e., **~3.64730687**. 

### Final Answer:
**3.64730687**
==================================================
Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 3.224553167474091
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate (P=S) Groups**: 
   - Molecules with **P(=S)** groups tend to have higher positive property values. For example:
     - **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a value of **3.78308651**.
     - **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** has a value of **3.64730687**.
   - The presence of **P(=S)** seems to contribute significantly to the property.

2. **Chlorinated Aromatic Rings**:
   - Chlorinated aromatic rings (e.g., **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1**) often appear with values around **-0.09270983** when they are the dominant feature.
   - However, when combined with other functional groups (like **P(=S)**), the property value increases.

3. **Ether Linkages (Oc1...)**: 
   - Ether linkages alone do not seem to strongly influence the property unless combined with other features.

4. **Alkyl Chains (CC, CCO, etc.)**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCCC**) typically have a value of **0.0** unless combined with other functional groups.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** has:
- A **P(=S)** group (strong positive contribution).
- An ethoxy group (**CCO**) attached to phosphorus (neutral or slight positive contribution).
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (**Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**) (typically neutral or slightly negative, but overshadowed by **P(=S)**).

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (3.78308651): This has **P(=S)**, a chlorinated aromatic ring, and additional polar groups. The property is high due to **P(=S)**.
- **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC** (3.64730687): This also has **P(=S)** and ester groups, leading to a high value.

Our target molecule has **P(=S)** and a chlorinated aromatic ring but lacks additional polar groups like esters or amides. Thus, its value should be slightly lower than the above examples but still significantly positive.

### Predicted Property:
Given the dominance of **P(=S)** and the absence of strongly negative features, the predicted property value is likely in the range of **3.5 to 3.8**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: 3.64730687**  
*(This matches the value of **CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC**, which is structurally similar in having **P(=S)** and an ethoxy group.)*

Iteration: 81
SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples, I observe the following patterns in the property values:

1. Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., C=C, CCCCBr, CCCCCCC) and halogenated hydrocarbons (e.g., ClCC(C)C, ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl) typically have property values of 0.0 or -0.09270983.

2. Aromatic systems without strongly polar or functionalized substituents (e.g., c1ccccc1(OC(=O)NC), c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12) tend to have values around -0.09270983 or higher positive values if they contain certain functional groups.

3. Molecules with amide (-CONH-), ester (-COOR), or other polar functional groups tend to have higher positive values (e.g., 3.85648129 for CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2).

4. The presence of multiple aromatic rings or extended conjugation sometimes increases the value (e.g., 2.61071983 for c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12).

For the molecule in question: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1

This is a pyridine derivative with a hydrazide group (-C(=O)NN) attached. The hydrazide group is polar and capable of hydrogen bonding, similar to amide groups which in the examples tend to increase the property value. The aromatic pyridine ring also contributes to the polarity.

Looking at similar molecules in the examples:
- CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 (with amide group) has -0.41550918
- COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1 (polar groups) has 1.71219525
- CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2 (multiple amide-like groups) has 3.85648129

Given that our molecule has one strong polar group (-C(=O)NN) attached to an aromatic system, but isn't as complex as some of the higher-valued examples, I would predict a value between 0.68 and 1.71.

A reasonable estimate would be: 1.34751651

This matches well with similar molecules in the dataset that have one strong polar functional group attached to an aromatic system.

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: -1.6070926228991647
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: This is a notable functional group, similar to the **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1** example, which has a value of **-0.06198445**. Phosphorothioates often contribute moderately negative or near-zero values.
2. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: Present in a cyclic structure (N1CCCCC1C). Amides can vary, but cyclic amides (like in **CCOC(=O)N**, which has **-0.03107967**) tend to have small negative or near-zero contributions.
3. **Alkyl Chains (CCCC, OCCC)**: These are neutral contributors (many examples with long alkyl chains have **0.0** or small values unless paired with polar groups).
4. **Thioether Linkage (SCC)**: Similar to **CCS** (which has **0.0**), this is likely neutral.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest structural analogs are molecules with **P(=S)** and **C(=O)N** groups, such as:
  - **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**: **-0.06198445**
  - **CCOC(=O)N**: **-0.03107967**
- The presence of both **P(=S)** and **C(=O)N** suggests a combined effect in the small negative range.
- No strongly positive (e.g., nitro groups) or strongly negative (e.g., polyhalogenation) features are present to push the value far from zero.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, the value is likely in the range of **-0.06 to -0.03**, similar to the phosphorothioate and amide-containing examples. A reasonable interpolation is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.05**  

*(Note: This is an educated estimate based on the given examples. For precise predictions, computational tools or QSAR models would be needed.)*
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can identify a pattern in the property values:

1. **Simple aliphatic hydrocarbons** (e.g., `ClCCBr`, `CC(Cl)Cl`, `CCC(O)CC`, `C/C1CCCCC1\C`, `CCCCCCCO`, `CC(C)CO`, `CC(C)CCO`, `CCCC1CCCC1`, etc.) consistently have a property value of **0.0**. These molecules lack aromatic rings, electronegative heteroatoms (like N, O, S, halogens beyond simple substitutions), or complex functional groups.

2. **Aromatic systems** (especially those with halogens or nitro groups) often have a property value of **-0.09270983**, unless they include additional complex functional groups that significantly alter the property (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C` has a much higher value due to its elaborate structure).

3. The molecule in question, **`CCCCCCCC` (octane)**, is a simple linear aliphatic hydrocarbon with no functional groups, aromaticity, or heteroatoms. 

**Conclusion**: Following the trend observed for similar aliphatic hydrocarbons in the examples, the predicted property value for `CCCCCCCC` is:  
**0.0**.

Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and analyzing the structural features of the given molecule, I will predict the property value for:

**Molecule:**  
`CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C`

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a polycyclic steroid-like structure with multiple fused rings (similar to some of the examples like `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O`, which has a property value of **1.91653536**).
2. **Functional groups**:
   - A ketone group (`C=O`) at position 2 (`=CC(=O)`), which is common in many of the examples with higher property values.
   - Two hydroxyl groups (`-OH` at positions 1 and 4), which can influence the property value (e.g., hydrogen bonding).
   - A terminal alkyne (`C#C`), which is a relatively rare feature in the examples but may slightly increase the property value due to its polarity.
3. **Ring system**: The molecule has a complex fused ring system with 4 rings, similar to some of the higher-valued examples (e.g., `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` with a value of **3.35974289**).

### Comparison with Examples:
- The closest analog in the examples is `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` (property = **1.91653536**), which also has a steroid-like core with a ketone and hydroxyl group. The given molecule has an additional hydroxyl group and a terminal alkyne, which may increase the property value slightly.
- Another similar example is `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` (property = **3.35974289**), which has two oxygen-containing functional groups (ketone and hydroxyl) and a similar ring system. The given molecule is slightly less complex (no additional fused ring) but has an alkyne.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarities and the influence of functional groups, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely in the range of **2.0 to 3.0**. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted Property Value: 2.456**  

This is based on interpolation between the closest examples and accounting for the additional alkyne group.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -0.2709121252514741
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I observe that the property values tend to cluster around certain key numbers, particularly **-0.09270983**, **0.0**, **3.40264009**, and **3.85648129**, among others. The property seems to correlate with structural features such as:

1. **Aromaticity and simple halogenated aromatics**: Often assigned **-0.09270983** (e.g., `c1ccccc1`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`).
2. **Aliphatic chains or non-aromatic, non-functionalized structures**: Often assigned **0.0** (e.g., `CCCCOCCO`, `CCCCCC(C)O`).
3. **Nitrogen-containing aromatics or extended conjugated systems**: Often assigned **3.40264009** (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1N`, `OCc1ccccc1`).
4. **Carbamates or ester-like structures with aromatic rings**: Often assigned **3.85648129** (e.g., `COC(=O)c1ccccc1`, `c1ccccc1(OC(=O)NC)`).

The molecule in question is:
```
COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
```
### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic regions**: Contains methoxy-substituted aromatic rings (`COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)`).
2. **Complex polycyclic and heterocyclic systems**: Includes fused rings with oxygen-containing functional groups (e.g., `OCOc5cc67`, `OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O`).
3. **Ester-like and ether linkages**: Presence of `COC2=O` (lactone-like) and multiple `OC` groups.

### Prediction:
The molecule shares similarities with structures that have:
- Aromatic methoxy groups (seen in `COc1ccccc1Cl`, which was assigned **3.40264009**).
- Polycyclic oxygen-rich systems (no exact match, but complex oxygenated structures in the examples often deviate from the simple **-0.09270983** or **0.0** values).
- No nitrogen atoms, ruling out the higher values like **3.85648129** (typically associated with carbamates or aromatic nitrogens).

Given the presence of **multiple oxygenated aromatic and alicyclic systems**, the most plausible property value is **3.40264009**, as this aligns with moderately complex oxygen-containing aromatics in the training set.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value: 3.40264009**
==================================================
Iteration: 86
SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for molecules with a similar structure to **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (which is a chlorophenol) tends to be **-0.09270983**. 

This is consistent with other halogenated aromatic compounds like:
- **Clc1ccccc1I** (-0.09270983)
- **Fc1ccccc1** (-0.09270983)
- **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (-0.09270983)
- **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (-0.09270983)

The presence of a hydroxyl group (**OH**) and a halogen (**Cl**) on the benzene ring does not seem to deviate from this value in the given dataset. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** is:  
**-0.09270983**

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 1.6497363640061333
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Fragments**:
   - **Cl-substituted aromatic ring**: `c1cccc(Cl)c1` (similar to `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)...` in some examples).
   - **Amide linkage**: `OC(=O)N` (seen in molecules like `CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1` with a high value of 3.856).
   - **Alkyne group**: `C#C` (not directly in examples, but similar to unsaturated groups).
   - **Chlorinated aliphatic chain**: `ClCC` (similar to `CCCCl` with a value of 0.0, but here it's more complex).

2. **Polarity and Conjugation**:
   - The amide group and aromatic ring suggest some polarity and conjugation, which often correlate with higher property values (e.g., amides in the examples have values ~3.4–3.8).
   - The Cl substituents may slightly lower the value (as seen in `Clc1ccc...` examples with values around -0.092).

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - `COc1ncnc2nccnc12` (heterocyclic, polar) has a value of **3.402**.
   - `CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1` (amide + aromatic) has a value of **3.856**.
   - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)...` (Cl-substituted aromatic) has values around **-0.092**.
   - The presence of both an amide and Cl-substituted aromatic suggests a balance between these effects.

### Prediction:
Given the amide group's dominance in raising the value and the Cl-substitution slightly lowering it, a reasonable estimate is **~3.0–3.5**. A plausible value is **3.40264009** (matching the polar heterocyclic example, as the amide's effect is similar).

### Final Answer:

5. **Hydroxy Groups (OH)**:
   - Phenolic OH (e.g., Oc1ccccc1) typically has the baseline value of **-0.09270983**.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The given molecule is:

   - A nitrogen-containing heterocycle (c2cncnc2).
   - Bulky, conjugated structure with multiple rings and substitutions.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:

Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 3.6473068695658277
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCOC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Alkyl Halides**: 
   - Molecules like **CCCCBr**, **CCS**, **BrC(Br)Br**, **CCI**, **C1CCCCCCC1**, and **CSSC** have a property value of **0.0**. These are typically non-polar or very simple structures with no significant functional groups that would influence the property.

2. **Aldehydes and Ketones**:
   - **CCCCCC=O** (hexanal) has a property value of **2.35770279**.
   - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C** (a more complex ketone/ester) has a value of **-0.91748554**, but this is likely due to other structural features.
   - **O=Cc1ccco1** (a heterocyclic aldehyde) has a value of **-0.09270983**, but this is likely due to the aromatic system overriding the aldehyde contribution.
   - The aldehyde group (**C=O**) seems to contribute positively to the property when it's terminal (as in **CCCCCC=O**).

3. **Ethers**:
   - **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate, an ester) has a value of **2.35770279**.
   - **CCOc1ccc(NC(N)=O)cc1** (an ether with additional functional groups) has a value of **-0.41550918**, but this is likely due to the other groups.
   - The ether linkage (**O**) alone doesn't seem to strongly influence the property unless combined with other features.

4. **Combination of Functional Groups**:
   - **CCCCOC=O** is a butyl formate (an ester with a formyl group). This is structurally similar to **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate), which has a value of **2.35770279**. The longer alkyl chain in **CCCCOC=O** might slightly reduce the property, but esters with terminal carbonyls tend to have values around **2.35**.

### Prediction for **CCCCOC=O**:
Given that:
- **CCCCCC=O** (hexanal) has a value of **2.35770279**.
- **CC(=O)OCC** (ethyl acetate) has a value of **2.35770279**.
- **CCCCOC=O** is an ester with a similar terminal carbonyl and a slightly longer alkyl chain, the property value is likely very close to these examples.

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCCOC=O** is:

**2.35770279**
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, molecules with simple halogenated aliphatic structures (e.g., `ClCCCl`, `CCBr`, `CNN`, `CC(C)(C)CCO`, etc.) consistently have a property value of **0.0**. These molecules lack complex functional groups or conjugated systems, which appear to contribute to non-zero values in the dataset.

The molecule `ClCCl` (dichloromethane) fits this pattern: it is a small, halogenated aliphatic compound with no additional functional groups or structural features that would suggest a deviation from the trend observed in similar molecules. 

Thus, the predicted property value for `ClCCl` is:  
**0.0**
==================================================
Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -1.3800318216428353
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** (which is 4-methylphenol or p-cresol), we can predict its property value by comparing it to structurally similar molecules in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (catechol) has a value of **-0.09270983**.
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol) also has **-0.09270983**.
   - Phenol-like structures with simple substituents (OH, NO₂) tend to cluster around **-0.09270983**.

2. **Methyl-Substituted Phenols**:
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (a dimethylphenol) has a value of **3.22455317**, suggesting that alkylation (especially with multiple methyl groups) increases the property value significantly.
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** (p-cresol) has only one methyl group, so its value should be lower than **3.22455317** but higher than plain phenol derivatives.

3. **Other Trends**:
   - Molecules with **NO₂** or **halogens** often have values around **-0.09270983**.
   - Alkyl chains or aromatic systems with **no polar groups** (e.g., **CCCCCCCCBr**) default to **0.0**.
   - The hydroxyl group (**OH**) alone doesn’t necessarily dominate the property unless combined with other features (e.g., alkylation).

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Phenol derivatives with simple substituents (OH, NO₂) are **-0.09270983**.
- Adding a methyl group (as in p-cresol) likely increases the value, but not as much as multiple methyl groups (which gave **3.22455317**).

A reasonable estimate for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is slightly above the phenol baseline but below heavily alkylated phenols. A plausible value is **~1.5–2.5**. 

Looking for the closest match in behavior, **CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (a diphenylacetamide derivative) has **1.34751651**, and **CC=CC=O** (an unsaturated aldehyde) has **-1.38003182**. Since p-cresol is more polarizable than simple phenols but less than heavily alkylated ones, **~1.71219525** (seen in **COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1**) seems reasonable.

### Final Prediction:
**1.71219525** (matching the trend for monoalkylated aromatics with polar groups). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is:  
**1.71219525**.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for molecules with multiple chlorine substitutions on aromatic rings (polychlorinated biphenyls or similar structures) tends to be **-0.09270983**. 

For the given molecule:  
**Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**  

This is a polychlorinated biphenyl derivative with chlorine substitutions on both aromatic rings, which matches the structural pattern of other examples with the value **-0.09270983** (e.g., `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl`, etc.).  

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**-0.09270983**
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -1.64332116091804
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isobutylene or 2-methylpropene), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might apply to this molecule.

### Observations from the Given Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbons with no functional groups** (e.g., alkanes, alkenes, or aromatic rings without polar substituents) tend to have property values close to **0.0** or slightly positive/negative depending on branching or unsaturation.
   - Example: `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` (branched alkane) has a value of **0.0**.
   - Example: `CCCCCCCC` (linear alkane) has a value of **0.0**.
   - Example: `CCCCCCCCC=C` (linear alkene) has a value of **3.64730687**, suggesting unsaturation (double bond) increases the value significantly.
   - Example: `Cc1ccccc1C` (toluene derivative) has a value of **-1.38003182**, but aromatic systems with substituents can vary widely.

2. **Branched alkenes**:
   - The molecule `CC=C(C)C` is a branched alkene (isobutylene). From the examples, branched alkenes are not directly represented, but we can infer:
     - The double bond introduces some polarity/unsaturation, but the branching might offset this compared to linear alkenes.
     - The closest analog is `CC(C)=CC3C(...)` (a more complex branched alkene) with a value of **0.67449076**, but this is not a perfect match.

3. **Simple alkenes**:
   - `COC(=O)C=C` (methyl acrylate) has a value of **-1.38003182**, but this includes an ester group, which heavily influences the value.
   - `CCCCC(CC)C=O` (branched aldehyde) has a value of **0.18411746**, but this includes a carbonyl group.

### Prediction for `CC=C(C)C`:
- It is a simple branched alkene with no polar functional groups. 
- Compared to linear alkanes (value = 0.0) and linear alkenes (value = 3.64730687), the branching and lack of additional functional groups suggest a value closer to 0.0 but slightly higher due to the double bond.
- Given the lack of exact matches, a reasonable estimate would be between **0.0 and 0.5**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the examples and trends, the predicted property value for **CC=C(C)C** is:  
**0.18411746** (similar to the branched aldehyde example, but adjusted for the lack of a carbonyl group). 

However, since this is a simpler alkene, a more conservative estimate might be closer to **0.0**. Given the uncertainty, I would predict:  
**0.18411746** (as it aligns with the slight increase due to unsaturation). 

But if forced to choose a single value, I'd lean toward:  
**0.18411746**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data.)

Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I observe that the property value tends to be **-0.09270983** for small, halogenated (especially chlorinated) molecules with simple structures. Examples include:

- `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` → **-0.09270983**  
- `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` → **-0.09270983**  
- `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` → **-0.09270983**  
- `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl` → **-0.09270983**  

The molecule `ClCCl` (dichloromethane) is a small, chlorinated hydrocarbon with no additional functional groups or complexity, similar to the above cases. Thus, the predicted property value is:

**-0.09270983**
==================================================
Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule `Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl`, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities.

### Observations:
1. **Chlorinated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - The molecule `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` (which is very similar to the target molecule) has a property value of `-0.09270983`.
   - The molecule `Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1` (brominated analog) also has the same value: `-0.09270983`.
   - The molecule `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2` (biphenyl, no halogens) also has `-0.09270983`.
   - This suggests that heavily halogenated aromatic rings (Cl or Br) or simple fused/connected aromatic systems tend to have this value unless other functional groups dominate.

2. **Target Molecule**: 
   - The target is `Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl`, which is a trichlorophenol (2,3,6-trichlorophenol). 
   - It is structurally very similar to `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` (from the examples), differing only in the position of one chlorine. 
   - The phenol group (`OH`) is present, but in the examples, this doesn't seem to significantly alter the property when combined with heavy chlorination.

3. **Other Functional Groups**:
   - The presence of other functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, amines, sulfonates) tends to override the halogen effect, but here the dominant feature is the chlorinated aromatic ring.

### Conclusion:
Given the similarity to `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl` and other halogenated aromatics with the value `-0.09270983`, the predicted property for `Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl` is:

**Predicted property value: -0.09270983**

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -0.2709121252514741
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with certain structural features of the molecules. Here's the observed pattern:

1. **Simple alkanes, alcohols, or halogenated alkanes (e.g., CCC(C)(C)CO, CCCCl, CCCC(C)O, CCCI, ClCC, CCCCCCl)**: These typically have a property value of **0.0**. These are relatively inert or non-polar structures.

2. **Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro groups, halogens, cyano groups) or heterocycles (e.g., Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2, N#Cc1ccccc1C#N, Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)**: These often have a property value of **-0.09270983**. These structures are likely associated with some form of electronic or steric effect.

3. **Highly conjugated or polycyclic systems (e.g., c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5cccc6c(c1)c2c3c4c56)**: These also tend to have **-0.09270983**, suggesting that extended conjugation or aromaticity contributes to this value.

4. **Complex molecules with multiple functional groups, especially those with carbonyls, sugars, or steroidal frameworks (e.g., Nc1ncnc2n(ccc12)C3OC(CO)C(O)C3O, CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO)**: These have **positive values (e.g., 3.90608631, 3.35974289)**, likely due to their size, polarity, or specific interactions.

5. **Molecules with sulfonamides, amides, or other polar groups (e.g., CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(C)c(Cl)c1, CCOC(=O)N(C)C(=O)CSP(=S)(OCC)OCC)**: These can have **negative values (e.g., -1.32980167)** or **positive values (e.g., 3.64730687)**, depending on the exact substituents.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule in question is:
```
COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
```
This is a **highly complex, polycyclic structure** with:
- Multiple aromatic rings (e.g., `c1cc...`).
- Ether linkages (`Oc`, `OC`).
- A carbonyl group (`COC2=O`).
- Sugar-like moieties (`OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O`).
- Fused ring systems (`C6C2C...c7cc5OCOc5cc67`).

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple polar groups (ethers, carbonyls, hydroxyls), this resembles the **steroidal or glycosidic structures** in the examples (e.g., `CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` with a value of **3.35974289**). 

### Predicted Property Value:
Based on the structural similarity to high-value examples, the predicted property value is likely in the **positive range**, specifically around **3.0 to 4.0**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**3.35974289** (similar to the steroidal examples). 

However, given the additional complexity (sugar-like moieties, more oxygenated groups), it could be slightly higher. 

Final prediction:  
**3.5** (approximate, considering the examples). 

For precision, I would align it with the closest structural analog:  
**3.35974289**.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -1.4973570159207048
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule `CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C`, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer the likely property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a thiazole-like ring (`S` adjacent to `N` and `C=O`) with a tetrazole-like substructure (`nnc(c(=O)n1N)`). This is a heterocyclic system with multiple nitrogen atoms and a carbonyl group.
2. **Substituents**: 
   - A thiomethyl group (`CS-`) attached to the ring.
   - A bulky tert-butyl group (`C(C)(C)C`) attached to the ring.
   - An amide-like (`c(=O)n1N`) moiety.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Nitrogen-rich heterocycles**: 
  - `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1` has a property value of **0.68041532**. This is a pyrimidone-like structure with similar nitrogen and carbonyl features.
  - `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2` has a value of **-0.09270983**, but this is a purine-like system with more aromaticity and less steric bulk.
- **Bulky substituents**: 
  - `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` has a value of **1.71219525**. This is a closer match due to the presence of a bulky tert-butyl group and a similar heterocyclic core (thiazole/tetrazole-like).
- **Thioether groups**: 
  - `CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1` has a high value (**3.78308651**), but this is due to the long aliphatic chain and aromatic ether, which are not present here.

### Key Observations:
1. The presence of the bulky tert-butyl group (`C(C)(C)C`) and the thioether (`CS-`) suggests a higher property value, similar to `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (1.71219525).
2. The nitrogen-rich heterocycle with a carbonyl group is less aromatic than pure aromatic systems (which often have values around -0.09270983), so the value should be higher.
3. The lack of long aliphatic chains or highly polar groups (e.g., nitro, carboxylic acid) prevents the value from being extremely high (>3).

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarity to `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (1.71219525), but with slightly less polarity (no hydroxyl group), the predicted property value for `CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C` would be slightly lower but still in the same range. 

**Final Prediction: 1.51809284**  
(This aligns with other molecules in the dataset with bulky substituents and heterocyclic cores, e.g., `CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2` also has 1.51809284, which is a reasonable match for this case.)
==================================================
Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.4155091795282542
Predicted Property:
Analyzing the given examples and the molecule in question (`CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1`), let's break down the structural features and compare them to similar molecules in the dataset to predict the property.

### Key Observations from the Dataset:
1. **Simple Alkanes/Alcohols/Ethers (e.g., `CC`, `CCC(C)(C)CO`, `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`)**: These typically have a property value of **0.0** unless they have additional functional groups or conjugation.
2. **Aromatic Rings (e.g., `c1ccccc1`, `o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13`)**: Bare aromatic systems (without polar or conjugated substituents) often have a value of **-0.09270983**.
3. **Esters (`C(=O)OC`)**: 
   - `CCCC(=O)OCC` has a value of **1.11974769**.
   - `CCCCCC(=O)OC` also has a value of **1.11974769**.
   - This suggests that aliphatic esters tend to have a value around **1.12**.
4. **Aromatic Esters (e.g., `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2`)**: This more complex aromatic ester has a value of **0.68041532**, but it has additional polar groups (sulfonyl, nitro, etc.) that likely reduce the value compared to simpler aromatic esters.
5. **Conjugated Carbonyls (e.g., `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`)**: These have higher values (e.g., **3.86775957**) due to extended conjugation.

### Target Molecule: `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1`
- This is an **aromatic ester** (ethyl benzoate), with a phenyl ring directly conjugated to the ester carbonyl (`C(=O)O`).
- Compared to aliphatic esters (value ~1.12), the aromatic conjugation likely increases the property value slightly, but not as much as fully conjugated diketones (e.g., `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` with value ~3.87).
- The closest analog in the dataset is `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2` (value = 0.68041532), but this has many additional substituents that lower the value. The simpler `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` should have a higher value.

### Predicted Value:
Given the above, the property value for `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1` is likely **between 1.12 (aliphatic ester) and 3.87 (fully conjugated aromatic diketone)**. A reasonable estimate is **~1.5**, but since the dataset shows aliphatic esters at ~1.12 and no simpler aromatic esters, I'll lean toward the next closest value for an aromatic system with moderate conjugation.

However, looking back, the aliphatic esters are consistently **1.11974769**, and the aromatic ester with extra groups is **0.68041532**. Since the target molecule is simpler (just an aromatic ester), it might be slightly higher than the aliphatic ester, but the dataset doesn't provide a clear example. 

Given the uncertainty, the safest bet is to assume it's similar to the aliphatic ester value, as the aromaticity may not drastically increase it without additional conjugation. Thus, the predicted value is:

**Predicted property value: 1.11974769** (same as aliphatic esters in the dataset). 

If forced to choose a more precise value, I'd say **1.12** is the most consistent with the given examples. 

### Final Answer:
**1.11974769**
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Alkanes and Haloalkanes**:
   - **CSSC** (disulfide) has a value of **0.0**.
   - **CI** (iodomethane) has a value of **0.0**.
   - **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol) has a value of **0.0**.
   - **CCN(=O)=O** (nitroethane) has a value of **0.0**.
   - **OCC(O)C(O)CO** (glycerol) has a value of **0.0**.
   - These suggest that simple, unfunctionalized or symmetrically functionalized molecules tend to have values close to **0.0**.

2. **Brominated Aromatics**:
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a value of **-0.09270983**.
   - This suggests that brominated aromatic systems have a slightly negative value.

3. **Brominated Alkanes**:
   - There are no direct examples of simple bromoalkanes, but **CI** (iodomethane) is a haloalkane with a value of **0.0**.
   - **C=CCS(=O)SCC=C** (a disulfide with alkenes) has a value of **-0.06198445**, which is close to zero but slightly negative.

4. **Long-Chain Alkanes**:
   - **CCCCCCC=C** (1-heptene) has a value of **3.74420298**, which is positive and relatively high.
   - **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol) has a value of **0.0**, suggesting that the presence of a polar group (OH) can neutralize the effect of the long chain.
   - **CCCC(=O)CCC** (4-heptanone) has a value of **1.11974769**, indicating that a ketone group in the middle of the chain gives a positive value.

5. **Bromoalkane Prediction**:
   - **CCCCCCCBr** is a simple bromoalkane with a long alkyl chain. Given that:
     - Simple haloalkanes like **CI** have a value of **0.0**.
     - Long-chain alkanes with non-polar groups (e.g., **CCCCCCC=C**) have positive values.
     - The bromine atom is not as polar as an OH group, so it may not neutralize the effect of the long chain as effectively as an OH group does in **CCCCCCCO**.
   - Therefore, the value is likely slightly positive but not as high as **CCCCCCC=C** (3.74420298). A reasonable estimate would be close to the value of **CCCC(=O)CCC** (1.11974769), but since bromine is less polar than a ketone, the value might be slightly lower.

### Predicted Property Value for **CCCCCCCBr**:
Given the above reasoning, the predicted property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is approximately **0.5**. This is a rough estimate based on the following:
- It is higher than **0.0** (simple haloalkanes) but lower than **1.11974769** (ketone-containing alkane).
- The long alkyl chain contributes a positive effect, while the bromine atom slightly reduces it.

### Final Answer:
**0.5** (estimated based on trends in the data).
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value appears to be **0.0** for small, simple, and non-aromatic molecules without significant functional groups or structural complexity. 

**Methanol (CO, or more accurately CH3OH)** is a small, simple alcohol with no aromaticity or complex substituents. Similar simple molecules in the dataset (e.g., `CCC`, `OC1CCCCCC1`, `CCC(C)CO`, `CCBr`) all have a property value of **0.0**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CO (methanol)** is:  
**0.0**
