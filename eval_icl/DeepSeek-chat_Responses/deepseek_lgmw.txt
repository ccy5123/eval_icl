SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -3.7641647332321133
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`  
This is a long-chain aliphatic ester (specifically, a methyl ester of a decanoic acid derivative). 

From the examples, we can see:
1. **Long aliphatic chains with polar groups** (e.g., `CCCCCC(C)O` has a value of `-0.40651912`, `CCCCCCCC(C)O` has `-0.82880745`, and `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` has `-1.04096544`). These suggest that longer chains with polar termini tend to have increasingly negative values.
2. **Esters**: The molecule `CCOC(=O)CC` has a value of `0.17315895`, but it is a much shorter ester. The longer-chain ester `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` is more similar to `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (value `-1.04096544`), which is also a long-chain ester.

Given the trend that longer aliphatic chains with polar groups (especially esters) have more negative values, and comparing to the very similar example `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (`-1.04096544`), the predicted property value for `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` would be close to this. 

However, the molecule you asked to predict is identical to one of the examples (`CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`), which already has a value of `-1.04096544`. 

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**-1.04096544**  

(Note: If this was a typo and the molecule is slightly different, the value would still likely be in the range of `-0.8` to `-1.2` based on the trends observed.)

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -2.3097724326893294
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **benzofuran-2-one-like** scaffold (a benzene fused to a lactone-like ring with a carbonyl group and an NH group). This is a heterocyclic system with some polarity due to the C=O and NH groups.
2. **Substituents**: 
   - A **chlorine atom (Cl)** is attached to the benzene ring, which adds some lipophilicity and electron-withdrawing character.
   - The **lactam-like (oc(=O)[nH])** group introduces hydrogen-bonding capability and polarity.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- **Cl-containing aromatic systems**: 
  - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` has a value of **0.5993873** (multiple Cl atoms increase lipophilicity).
  - `ClC=C` has a value of **0.71212972** (simple chloroalkene).
  - `Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has a value of **0.2436221** (polar OH and multiple Cl atoms reduce the value).
- **Heterocycles with C=O/NH**: 
  - `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)` has a value of **-0.48537589** (polar thiourea-like structure).
  - `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(=O)` has a value of **-0.04311575** (cyclic urea with high polarity).
  - `Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C` has a value of **-0.94808377** (polar imide with bulky groups).

### Key Observations:
1. The presence of **Cl** on an aromatic ring tends to increase the property value (lipophilicity contribution), but the **polar lactam-like group (oc(=O)[nH])** will decrease it due to hydrogen bonding.
2. The molecule is somewhat similar to polar heterocycles like `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)` but with an aromatic Cl substituent, which may slightly offset the polarity.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between the **Cl substituent (increasing value)** and the **polar lactam-like group (decreasing value)**, the property value is likely in the **low positive or slightly negative range**. 

Comparing to similar molecules, a reasonable prediction is:  
**Predicted value: ~0.15**

### Refined Estimate:
- The closest analog is `COc2c1occc1c(OC)c3c(=O)cc(C)oc23` (value: **0.14315415**), which also has a fused polar heterocycle and substituents.
- Adjusting for the Cl substituent (slightly higher lipophilicity) and the NH group (slightly more polar), the value should be similar but marginally higher.

**Final predicted value: 0.18**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on structural trends in the data.)

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.37540651577611545
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)N(=O)=O** (isopropyl nitrite or a nitroalkane derivative), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Nitrogen-containing functional groups**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups (**N(=O)=O**) or nitroso groups (**N=O**) tend to have negative property values. For example:
     - `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` has a value of **-2.49163393**.
     - `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` has a value of **-0.37748028**.
   - The presence of a nitro group seems to contribute significantly to lowering the property value.

2. **Alkyl groups**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., `CCCOCC`, `CCC(C)CC`) tend to have positive or near-zero values unless paired with strongly electronegative groups.
   - The molecule `CC(C)N(=O)=O` has an isopropyl group (**CC(C)**), which is a simple alkyl substituent.

3. **Electronegative atoms**:
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, F) and oxygen/nitrogen in polar functional groups often lead to negative values, especially when multiple such groups are present (e.g., `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` has **-6.31841724**).

4. **Hybridization and conjugation**:
   - Aromatic systems with no strongly electronegative groups tend to have near-zero values (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3c2ccc4c5ccccc5ccc43` has **0.42206158**).
   - Conjugated systems with electronegative atoms (e.g., `O=c1cc[nH]c(=O)[nH]1`) have slightly negative values.

### Prediction for CC(C)N(=O)=O:
- The molecule has a nitro group (**N(=O)=O**), which is strongly electronegative and likely to contribute a negative value.
- It also has an isopropyl group (**CC(C)**), which is a simple alkyl substituent and might slightly offset the negativity.
- Comparing to similar nitro-containing molecules:
  - `Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO` has **-2.49163393**, but it has additional electronegative atoms (oxygen in CCO) and a more complex structure.
  - `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` has **-0.37748028**, with a less electronegative nitroso group and fluorine.
- Given that **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is simpler but has a full nitro group, a reasonable estimate would be between **-1.0 and -2.0**.

### Final Prediction:
A plausible property value for **CC(C)N(=O)=O** is **-1.5**. This balances the strong negativity of the nitro group with the offsetting effect of the alkyl group. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, dipole moment, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data.)

Iteration: 4
SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 1.1381942340460152
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size/complexity. The molecule in question is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, hydroxyl (-OH), and carbonyl (C=O) groups, which are polar and can influence the property value.

Breaking down the molecule:
1. **Core structure**: Polycyclic (steroid-like) with multiple fused rings. From the examples, polycyclic aromatic structures (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54`) have small or negative values, but steroid-like structures with polar groups can deviate.
2. **Functional groups**:
   - Hydroxyl (-OH): Increases polarity (likely decreases the property value, as seen in `OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O` with -4.81897433).
   - Carbonyl (C=O): Polar but can vary (e.g., `CC(=O)C(C)(C)C` has 0.20577762, while `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` has -4.685657).
   - The terminal `C(=O)CO` (aldehyde-like) may increase polarity further.
3. **Comparison to similar examples**:
   - `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C` (steroid with two C=O) has a value of **0.84843487**.
   - The presence of an additional -OH and aldehyde-like group here suggests a more polar molecule, likely reducing the property value compared to the above example.

Given these observations, the property value is likely **positive but smaller** than the similar steroid example due to increased polarity. A reasonable prediction is:

**Predicted property value: 0.42**  

This aligns with the balance between the steroid core (tending toward positive values) and the polar groups (reducing the value slightly).

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.8096405401411433
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Aromatic rings**: The molecule contains two aromatic rings (one with fluorine substituents and one with a chlorine substituent). Aromatic rings with halogens (Cl, F) are present in many examples, and their contributions vary based on substitution patterns.
   - Example: `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of **-1.74509905**.
   - Example: `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1` has a value of **-1.71841599**.
   - Example: `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` has a value of **-0.8960569**.

2. **Amide groups**: The molecule has two amide linkages (`C(=O)NC(=O)`). Amides are polar and can lower the property value.
   - Example: `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` has a value of **-0.21210948**.
   - Example: `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` has a value of **-1.14534033**.

3. **Halogen substitutions**: The presence of fluorine and chlorine atoms tends to decrease the property value, especially when multiple halogens are present.
   - Example: `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has a value of **-2.03370554**.
   - Example: `Fc1ccccc1` (not explicitly given, but similar to `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` with **-0.8960569**).

4. **Combined effects**: The molecule is a hybrid of aromatic systems with halogens and polar amide groups. The presence of multiple electronegative atoms (F, Cl, O, N) suggests a significant negative contribution to the property value.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog might be `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` (value: **-1.14534033**), but our molecule has more halogens and additional amide groups, which would likely further decrease the value.
- Another similar molecule is `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (value: **-1.74509905**), but our molecule has more polar groups (amides) and fluorine substituents, which could push the value lower.

### Prediction:
Given the combined effects of:
- Two aromatic rings with halogens (F and Cl),
- Two amide groups (`C(=O)N`),
- High electronegativity and polarity,

the property value is likely to be in the range of **-1.7 to -2.2**. A reasonable estimate is **-1.95**.

### Final Answer:
**-1.95**
==================================================
Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 0.17242200828566182
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOC(C)C** (isopropyl propyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - Molecules with ether linkages tend to have moderate property values, often in the range of **0.1 to 0.4** (e.g., `CCOC(=O)CC` has **0.173**, `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(O)CCC12C)C3CCC4=O` has **0.580**, and `OCC3OC(OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C(O)C3O` has **1.829**). However, the latter is a complex sugar with multiple hydroxyl groups, which skews the value higher.
   - Simpler ethers like `CCOC(=O)CC` (ethyl acetate, with an ester) have values around **0.173**, while `CCCOC(C)C` is structurally similar but lacks the carbonyl group.

2. **Branching and Size**:
   - Branched alkanes or ethers (e.g., `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C`) tend to have slightly negative values (around **-0.3 to -0.1**).
   - Linear ethers or alcohols (e.g., `CCCCCO`) have positive values (e.g., **0.389** for pentanol).

3. **Polarity and Heteroatoms**:
   - The presence of oxygen (ether or alcohol) generally increases the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons, but branching can reduce it.

### Prediction for **CCCOC(C)C**:
- This is a branched ether (isopropyl propyl ether) with no additional functional groups. 
- It is less polar than alcohols or esters but more polar than pure hydrocarbons.
- Comparing to similar molecules:
  - `CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C` (branched hydrocarbon): **-0.357**
  - `CCCCCO` (linear alcohol): **0.389**
  - `CCOC(=O)CC` (ester): **0.173**
  - `CC(C)CC(C)(C)O` (branched alcohol): **-0.086**

Given its branched structure and ether linkage, I expect the property value to be **slightly positive but lower than linear ethers/alcohols**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.12** (likely in the range of **0.1 to 0.2**). 

This balances the ether's polarity (increasing the value) with the branching (decreasing it slightly).

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.1580371864965359
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains a **bromine (Br)** substituent, which is electronegative and often contributes to negative property values (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has -0.92971337, `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` has -1.05292195).
   - It has a **lactam-like structure** (cyclic amide with C=O and NH) and a second carbonyl (C=O), which can introduce polarity and hydrogen bonding potential. Similar structures like `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (-4.685657) and `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)CC=C` (-1.2235854) have negative values.
   - The **tertiary butyl group (CCC(C))** is bulky and hydrophobic, which may slightly offset the negative contribution from polar groups (e.g., `CCC(C)CC` has 0.4167405).

2. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **Br** and polar groups (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1`) tend to have negative values (~ -1.0 to -1.7).
   - The presence of **two carbonyls** and **NH** in a ring (like the uracil-like core here) suggests additional negative contributions (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` is very negative at -4.685657, but this is extreme due to multiple amides).
   - The **tertiary butyl group** may reduce the negativity slightly compared to purely polar/aromatic Br-substituted molecules.

3. **Hybrid Features**:
   - The molecule is a mix of hydrophobic (tertiary butyl) and polar (Br, lactam, carbonyl) features. Similar hybrids like `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (-1.05292195) or `Nc3ccc2cc1ccccc1cc2c3` (-2.46073643) suggest a moderately negative value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, the molecule's property value is likely in the **moderately negative range**, similar to other Br-containing polar compounds but not as extreme as multi-amide systems. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: -1.45**  

This balances the negative contributions from Br and the polar lactam/carbonyl with the slight positive offset from the hydrophobic tert-butyl group.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -1.2376815423558132
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** (biphenyl), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have negative property values, especially with polar or electronegative substituents (e.g., NO₂, Cl, OH). For example:
     - **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**: -2.62737661 (sulfonamide substituent)
     - **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: -2.16209103 (dinitrobenzene)
   - Larger conjugated systems (e.g., polyaromatics) tend to have less negative or positive values. For example:
     - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67** (a large polyaromatic): 0.69759912
     - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** (a phenanthrene derivative): -0.18369914

2. **Biphenyl-like Structures**:
   - The molecule **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** is biphenyl, which consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond. From the examples, similar fused or connected aromatic systems show:
     - **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34**: -0.18369914 (phenanthrene, 3 fused rings)
     - **c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67**: 0.69759912 (large polyaromatic)
   - Biphenyl is less conjugated than fused polyaromatics but more conjugated than a single benzene ring. Single benzene rings with no substituents are not in the examples, but substituted benzenes with electron-withdrawing groups are very negative.

3. **Non-Substituted Aromatics**:
   - The presence of substituents (especially electronegative ones) lowers the property value. Biphenyl has no substituents, so it should be less negative than substituted benzenes.
   - The closest example is **Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C** (a dimethyl-substituted naphthalene-like structure): -1.33821392. Biphenyl is simpler (no methyl groups) and less conjugated than naphthalene, so its value should be less negative.

### Prediction:
- Biphenyl is a simple conjugated system with no electronegative substituents. It is more conjugated than a single benzene ring but less than fused polyaromatics. 
- Based on the examples, I expect its property value to be slightly negative but closer to zero than substituted benzenes or fused polyaromatics. 
- A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.5 and 0**. 

Looking at similar structures:
- **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34**: -0.18369914 (phenanthrene)
- **C1CCc2ccccc2C1**: -0.45850817 (a benzene ring with a non-aromatic cyclohexyl group)

Biphenyl is less conjugated than phenanthrene but more than a single benzene ring, so I predict a value slightly more negative than phenanthrene but less negative than substituted benzenes. 

### Final Prediction:
**-0.35** (approximately midway between -0.18369914 and -0.45850817). 

Thus, the predicted property value for **c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2** is:  
**-0.35** (estimated). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. The actual property might be something like logP, solubility, or a quantum chemical property, but the reasoning holds for many such properties.)

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.3595201817810073
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as size, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and branching. The molecule in question is **CCCCS** (butanethiol), which is a linear aliphatic thiol (sulfur-containing analog of an alcohol).

### Observations from the examples:
1. **Simple aliphatic chains** (e.g., CCCCCCC(C)C, CCC1CCCCC1) tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative.
2. **Functional groups** like halogens (Cl, Br), nitro groups (NO2), or sulfur-containing groups can shift the property value significantly (either positive or negative).
3. **Sulfur-containing molecules** in the examples:
   - COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O: **0.09126994**
   - CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1: **-1.90828783** (though this is more complex with an ester and amine)
   - CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSc1ccc(Cl)cc1: **1.10862222** (phosphorothioate with Cl)
   - Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1: **-0.75730571** (thioamide)
   - COCCCNc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(SC)n1: **0.32156169** (thiocarbamate)

For **CCCCS**:
- It is a simple aliphatic thiol (no aromaticity, no halogens, no branching).
- Thiols are polar but less polar than alcohols, and the aliphatic chain is short (4 carbons).
- Comparing to similar-sized aliphatic molecules:
  - CCC1CCCCC1: **-0.00730849**
  - CCCCC(C)C: **0.20505842**
  - CCC(=C)C: **0.44458867**

The sulfur in **CCCCS** is not as strongly electron-withdrawing as in more complex sulfur-containing groups (e.g., thiocarbonyls or phosphorothioates), so it may not drastically shift the property value. 

### Predicted property value for **CCCCS**:
Given the simplicity of the molecule and the trends, a reasonable estimate would be slightly positive, similar to other small aliphatic compounds with mild polar character. 

**Predicted value: ~0.25**  
(Note: This is an educated guess based on the examples; the actual value could vary slightly depending on the specific property being modeled.)

Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.08598968302958804
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCC(C)(C)CO**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Size**: Larger, more hydrophobic molecules (e.g., alkanes, aromatic rings) tend to have higher property values. For example:
   - **CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane) has a value of **0.4167405**.
   - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (larger branched alkane) has a value of **-0.35654866**, but this may be due to other factors like branching or symmetry.

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Hydroxyl (-OH) groups** generally decrease the property value (make it more negative). For example:
     - **CCCC(C)(O)CC** has a value of **-0.08598968**.
     - **CC(C)CC(C)O** has a value of **0.17242201** (less negative, possibly due to less branching).
   - **Halogens (Cl, Br)** often decrease the value, especially when multiple are present (e.g., **ClC(Cl)Cl** has **-0.15209386**).

3. **Branching vs. Linear Chains**:
   - Linear chains (e.g., **CCCC/C=C/C**) tend to have higher values (e.g., **0.23762029**).
   - Branched chains with -OH groups (e.g., **CCCC(C)(O)CC**) have lower values.

4. **Combination of Features**:
   - The presence of both branching and a polar group (like -OH) tends to reduce the property value further.

### Analysis of **CCCC(C)(C)CO**:
- This is a branched alkane (**CCCC(C)(C)**) with a terminal hydroxyl group (**-CO**).
- Similar to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (value: **-0.08598968**), but with slightly more branching (tertiary carbon) and a terminal -OH.
- The additional branching may slightly reduce the value compared to less branched analogs.
- The terminal -OH is likely to have a similar effect as in other examples, pulling the value toward the negative side.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the similarities to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (-0.08598968) and **CC(C)CC(C)O** (0.17242201), but with more branching, a reasonable estimate would be slightly more negative than **CCCC(C)(O)CC** but not as extreme as highly polar or halogenated molecules. 

**Predicted value: -0.15** (approximate, considering the trends). 

However, looking more closely, **CC(C)CC(C)O** (similar branching but smaller) has **0.17242201**, while **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (less branching) has **-0.08598968**. The additional branching in **CCCC(C)(C)CO** may not drastically change the value, so a value closer to **-0.10** might also be plausible. 

Given the uncertainty, I would lean toward:  
**Predicted value: -0.12** (interpolating between similar structures). 

But to align more closely with the provided examples, especially **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (-0.08598968), and accounting for the extra branching, a slight adjustment gives:  
**Final predicted value: -0.10**. 

However, since **CC(C)CC(C)O** (more branching but smaller) is **0.17242201**, and **CCCC(C)(O)CC** is **-0.08598968**, the larger size of **CCCC(C)(C)CO** might balance the branching effect, leading to a value closer to **-0.05**. 

After reconsidering, the most consistent estimate is:  
**Predicted value: -0.08** (similar to **CCCC(C)(O)CC** but accounting for slight differences). 

Given the variability, the safest answer is:  
**Predicted value: -0.09**. 

But to match the closest example (**CCCC(C)(O)CC** with **-0.08598968**), the prediction is:  
**Predicted value: -0.09**. 

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is **-0.09**.

To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples. 

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a **methyl-substituted naphthalene** (specifically, 1-methylnaphthalene). It consists of a naphthalene core (two fused benzene rings) with a methyl group (-CH3) attached to one of the rings.

### Comparison with Given Examples:
1. **Naphthalene Core**: 
   - The molecule **c1ccccc1** (benzene) has a property value of **0.52481706**.
   - The molecule **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (1,4-dimethylnaphthalene) has a property value of **-1.33821392**.
   - The molecule **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (a more complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a value of **-2.58465403**.

2. **Methyl Substitution**:
   - Adding a methyl group to benzene (e.g., **Cc1ccccc1**, toluene) increases hydrophobicity but doesn't drastically change the property (similar to benzene's value).
   - In naphthalene derivatives, methyl substitution tends to slightly reduce the property value (e.g., compare benzene to naphthalene derivatives).

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **Cc1cccc(C)c1C** (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene) has a value of **-0.16965113**.
   - **Cc1ccc(C)cc1** (p-xylene) has a value of **0.10383182**.

### Prediction:
The molecule **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (1-methylnaphthalene) is less complex than the highly substituted examples with very negative values but more complex than simple benzene/toluene. Given the naphthalene core and a single methyl group, the property value should be slightly negative but not as extreme as the highly substituted cases.

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.5 and -1.0**. Comparing to similar structures:
- **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (1,4-dimethylnaphthalene) has **-1.33821392**.
- **Cc1cccc(C)c1C** (trimethylbenzene) has **-0.16965113**.

Since 1-methylnaphthalene has only one methyl group (less substitution than the dimethyl case), its value should be less negative than **-1.33821392** but more negative than simple aromatics like toluene.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.85** (a balanced estimate based on the given examples). 

This aligns with the trend where adding aromatic rings and alkyl groups reduces the property value, but not as drastically as heavy substitution or polar functional groups.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: -0.2982425809164913
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples:

### Key Observations:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **hydantoin-like core** (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1), which is a cyclic structure with multiple carbonyl groups and nitrogens. This is similar to the molecule **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C** in the examples, which has a property value of **-8.72128431**. 

2. **Substituents**: The given molecule has additional substituents compared to the example:
   - A **branched alkyl chain (C(C)CCC)** and a **vinyl group (CC=C)** attached to the hydantoin core. These are larger and more hydrophobic than the simple **CC=C** in the example.

3. **Impact of Substituents**:
   - The **branched alkyl chain (C(C)CCC)** introduces more hydrophobicity, which typically increases the property value (as seen in other examples where larger alkyl groups lead to higher values, e.g., **CC(C)C** has 0.76022964 vs. **CCCCCCCCCCCCCC** has -1.95377041).
   - The **vinyl group (CC=C)** is similar to the example but slightly less polar due to the extended conjugation.

4. **Comparison to the Example**:
   - The example with the simpler hydantoin (**O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C**) has a very low value (-8.72128431), likely due to the polar nature of the core and the small substituent.
   - The given molecule has a **larger hydrophobic substituent (C(C)CCC)**, which should **increase the property value** compared to the example but still keep it negative due to the polar core.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarity to the example but with increased hydrophobicity, the property value should be **less negative** than -8.72128431 but still significantly negative. A reasonable estimate would be around **-6.5**.

### Final Answer:
**-6.5** (approximate prediction based on structural comparison).

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.8960569018545745
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** (trifluoromethylbenzene), let's analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Fluorine Substituents**: 
   - The molecule contains a **CF3** (trifluoromethyl) group attached to a benzene ring. 
   - From the examples, halogenated aromatic compounds like **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (-0.294) and **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (+1.251) show that halogens can influence the property value, with multiple halogens tending to increase it.

2. **Aromatic Rings**: 
   - Simple benzene derivatives without polar groups (e.g., **CCc1ccccc1CC**, -0.514) tend to have moderately negative values. 
   - The presence of electron-withdrawing groups (like **CF3**) may further reduce the property value, but the strong electronegativity of fluorine could also introduce unique effects.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (iodochlorobenzene) has a value of -0.294.
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl-like) has +0.599.
   - The **CF3** group is more electron-withdrawing than Cl or I, which might push the value lower than -0.294 but not as extreme as highly polar or polyhalogenated cases.

4. **Trifluoromethyl Effect**:
   - The **CF3** group is strongly electronegative but also bulky. In the absence of other polar groups, it may not drastically alter the property beyond the range seen for other halogenated aromatics.

### Prediction:
Given the above, **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** likely has a property value **between -0.5 and 0.0**, closer to the moderately negative range of simple halogenated aromatics but not as extreme as polyhalogenated or highly polar molecules. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.35**  

This aligns with the trend observed for mono-/di-halogenated aromatics while accounting for the stronger electron-withdrawing effect of **CF3** compared to Cl or Br. 

(Note: Without explicit knowledge of the property being predicted—e.g., logP, dipole moment, or another descriptor—this is an educated guess based on the given examples' trends.)

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -4.818974334752472
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, hydrogen bonding, molecular weight, and functional groups. The molecule in question is **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**, which is a sugar derivative (specifically, a hexose sugar like glucose or mannitol with multiple hydroxyl groups).

From the examples, highly polar molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, property = **-8.81456796**) have very negative property values, likely due to strong hydrogen bonding and high hydrophilicity. The molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2** (property = **-8.72128431**) also has a very negative value, suggesting that cyclic structures with multiple hydrogen-bonding groups contribute significantly to the property.

The molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is structurally similar to these highly polar, multi-hydroxyl compounds. It has five hydroxyl groups and a cyclic structure, which would enhance hydrogen bonding and polarity. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** should be **very negative**, close to the other highly hydroxylated examples. A reasonable estimate would be:

**Predicted property value: ~ -8.5 to -9.0**

For specificity, I'll predict:  
**-8.7** (similar to the other cyclic polyol examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being measured—e.g., solubility, partition coefficient, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 1.53071888620701
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples. The molecule is:

**CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**

### Key Structural Observations:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a polycyclic steroid-like structure with multiple rings (e.g., **CCC4C2CCC1...**), similar to some of the provided examples (e.g., **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C**, which has a property of **0.72113277**).
2. **Ketone groups**: It contains two ketone groups (**C(=O)**), which are polar and can influence the property. Examples with ketones (e.g., **CCCC(=O)CCCC** with **-0.75928689**) tend to have negative values, but the steroid core may counteract this.
3. **Hydroxyl groups**: It has two hydroxyl groups (**C(O)**), which are highly polar and typically reduce the property value (e.g., **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** with **-8.81456796**). However, the steroid core may mitigate this effect.
4. **Ester group**: The **CC(=O)OCC(=O)** fragment is an ester, which is moderately polar. Esters in the examples (e.g., **CCOC(=O)C** with **0.38955475**) tend to have positive or near-zero values.
5. **Conjugated system**: The **C=CC1(C)** fragment suggests some conjugation, which can slightly stabilize the molecule but may not drastically affect the property.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (property: **1.1220402**): This is very similar to the given molecule but lacks the hydroxyl groups and has one fewer ketone. Its property is positive and moderately high.
- **CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** (property: **0.72113277**): This has a steroid core with one ketone and one hydroxyl group, yielding a positive but lower value than the above.

### Prediction:
The given molecule has:
- A steroid core (positive contribution, ~0.7 to 1.1).
- Two ketones (slightly negative contribution, but less significant in this context).
- Two hydroxyl groups (negative contribution, but the core may offset this).
- An ester group (neutral to slightly positive).

Given the similarities to **CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (1.1220402) but with additional polar groups (hydroxyls), the property will likely be slightly lower but still positive. 

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: 0.85** (range: 0.7 to 1.0). 

This balances the steroid core's positive contribution with the polar groups' slight reduction.

Iteration: 16
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 0.5804389801753991
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, an alcohol group (-OH), and a ketone (=O). 

Breaking it down:
1. **Rings and complexity**: The molecule has four fused rings (steroid backbone), which generally contribute to lower property values (more negative) due to increased hydrophobicity and reduced polarity. However, the presence of polar functional groups can offset this.
2. **Functional groups**: 
   - The hydroxyl group (-OH) is polar and tends to increase the property value (less negative or more positive).
   - The ketone (=O) is also polar and contributes similarly.
3. **Comparison to examples**:
   - Molecules with multiple rings and polar groups (e.g., `OC(C1=CC2C5C(C1C2=C(c3ccccc3)c4ccccn4)C(=O)NC5=O)(c6ccccc6)c7ccccn7`, property = 2.06894721) have high positive values due to extensive conjugation and polar groups.
   - Simpler fused-ring systems with fewer polar groups (e.g., `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13`, property = -1.99263224) have very negative values.
   - The given molecule is intermediate: it has fused rings but also polar -OH and =O groups.

**Prediction**: The molecule is less polar than highly conjugated systems but more polar than simple fused hydrocarbons. Based on similar examples (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O`, property = 0.33643569), the predicted property value is likely in the range of **0.3 to 0.6**.

### Final predicted value: **0.45** (approximate, based on structural similarity to examples).

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -4.823865922968746
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **Acetamide (CH3-CO-NH-)**: Present in the molecule (CC(=O)N-). 
     - Example: **CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1** has a property value of **-1.96067827**, but this is a tertiary amide with a large aliphatic chain, which likely contributes to its very negative value.
     - The primary amide here may have a less extreme effect.
   - **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: Attached to the aromatic ring. 
     - Example: **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1** has a value of **-0.23426316**.
     - Example: **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has a value of **-1.18700921** (note the methoxy group is electron-donating, which may destabilize the nitro group interaction).
   - **Aromatic ring with substituents**: The nitro and acetamide groups are para to each other, which may lead to some electronic effects (e.g., resonance or steric interactions).

2. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2** has a value of **0.14329113**. This is a nitro-substituted amide, but with a more complex heterocycle.
   - **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** has a value of **-1.18700921**, but the methoxy group is electron-donating, unlike the acetamide here, which is electron-withdrawing.
   - **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1** has a value of **-0.23426316**, but lacks the acetamide group.

3. **Electronic Effects**:
   - The acetamide group is electron-withdrawing, which may stabilize the nitro group's interaction with the ring, leading to a less negative value than **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** but more negative than **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1**.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of both an electron-withdrawing acetamide and a nitro group on the aromatic ring, the property value is likely moderately negative. A reasonable estimate would be between **-0.5 and -1.0**, closer to the nitrobenzene example but adjusted for the additional acetamide group.

**Predicted property value: -0.75** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the given data). 

For higher precision, I would compare more closely to molecules like **O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2 (0.14329113)** and **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (-1.18700921)**, but the acetamide here is directly conjugated with the ring, which may pull the value slightly more negative than **0.14329113** but not as extreme as **-1.18700921**. 

Thus, a refined estimate: **-0.65**. 

However, considering the strong electron-withdrawing nature of both groups, the value might be closer to **-0.8**. 

**Final predicted value: -0.78**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data.)

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 1.3016312153143277
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, I'll analyze the structural features of the molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12` and compare them to the trends observed in the dataset to predict the property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (`P(=S)(OCC)OCC`)**: This is a relatively polar and bulky group. Similar polar/charged groups in the dataset (e.g., `COC(=O)`, `CN(C=O)`) often correspond to property values in the range of ~0.1 to ~0.7. The presence of sulfur (`S`) might slightly lower the value (e.g., `CSSC` has 0.299).

2. **Thiocarbamate linkage (`SCn`)**: The sulfur-carbon-nitrogen linkage is moderately polar. Similar linkages (e.g., `NC=O`) in the dataset tend to have values around 0.5–0.7.

3. **Chlorinated aromatic ring (`cc(Cl)ccc`)**: Chlorine substituents on aromatic rings tend to decrease the property value (e.g., `Clc1cccc2ccccc12` has -1.718, `Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1` has -6.318). However, the effect is less pronounced when the chlorine is part of a larger, more complex system.

4. **Lactam-like heterocycle (`c(=O)oc2ccc`)**: The presence of a carbonyl (`C=O`) in a heterocyclic ring (similar to lactams) often corresponds to values around 0.5–0.7 (e.g., `CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3` has 0.674).

5. **Ethoxy groups (`OCC`)**: Alkoxy groups are moderately polar and often correspond to values around 0.1–0.4 (e.g., `CCCC(=O)OC` has 0.173).

### Combining these observations:
- The phosphorothioate and thiocarbamate groups suggest a value in the range of 0.3–0.7.
- The chlorinated aromatic ring might slightly reduce the value, but the effect is mitigated by the other polar groups.
- The lactam-like heterocycle and ethoxy groups support a value in the upper part of this range.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the balance of these features, the predicted property value is approximately **0.45**. 

This is based on the following reasoning:
- The molecule is more polar than simple aromatic systems (which often have lower values) but less polar than highly charged or nitrile-containing molecules (e.g., `CC#N` has 0.932).
- The presence of sulfur and chlorine suggests a slight reduction from the polar group contributions.

Thus, the final prediction is:  
**0.45** (estimated range: 0.4–0.5).

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.3889278361632943
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**, I will analyze the given examples and identify structural and functional group trends that correlate with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Alcohols (-OH group)**:
   - Simple alcohols like **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol) and **CC(C)CO** (tert-butanol) have property values around **0.575** (e.g., `CC(C)CO` = 0.57524162). 
   - The presence of branching (tertiary carbon) tends to slightly increase the property value compared to linear alcohols (e.g., `CCC` = 0.9037335, but this is propane, not an alcohol).
   - The molecule **CC(C)(C)CO** is **tert-butanol**, which is highly branched.

2. **Branching Effects**:
   - Branching generally increases the property value (e.g., `CCC` = 0.9037335 vs. `CCCC` = not provided, but `CC(C)CO` = 0.575). 
   - Tertiary carbons (like in **CC(C)(C)CO**) further increase the value compared to secondary or primary alcohols.

3. **Similar Examples**:
   - `CC(C)CO` (isobutanol) has a value of **0.57524162**.
   - `CC(C)(C)CO` (tert-butanol) is even more branched, so its value should be slightly higher than isobutanol but not as high as non-alcohol branched alkanes like `CCC` (0.9037335).

4. **Oxygenated Groups**:
   - The `-OH` group tends to reduce the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCC` = 0.9037335 vs. `CCO` = not provided, but `CC(C)CO` = 0.575). 

### Prediction:
Given that **CC(C)(C)CO** is tert-butanol (more branched than isobutanol but still an alcohol), its property value should be slightly higher than isobutanol's **0.575** but less than propane's **0.903**. A reasonable estimate would be around **0.65**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CC(C)(C)CO: 0.65** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

(Note: If more precise interpolation is needed, a value between 0.60 and 0.70 would be reasonable, but the closest analog is `CC(C)CO` = 0.575, so **0.65** accounts for the additional branching in tert-butanol.)

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: -0.5677428582797995
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, I will analyze the molecule **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** and predict its property value based on structural similarities and trends observed in the dataset.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains multiple nitrogen atoms in a fused heterocyclic ring system (imidazole and pyrimidine-like rings) with an amide-like carbonyl group (C=O). This suggests significant polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.
2. **Aromaticity**: The structure is aromatic, which typically contributes to stability but may also influence electronic properties.
3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** (property: -0.37748028): This molecule has a similar imidazole-like ring with a carbonyl and nitrogen substituents. The presence of fluorine (electron-withdrawing) likely increases the property value compared to our target molecule.
   - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property: -1.68666634): This is a fused purine-like system with methoxy substitution. The lack of hydrogen-bond donors (like NH) and the presence of methoxy (electron-donating) may lower the property value compared to our target.
   - **Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1** (property: 0.01383055): This is a simpler uracil-like fragment with NH and C=O groups. Our target molecule is more complex but shares similar hydrogen-bonding features.

### Key Observations:
- Molecules with fused nitrogen-containing heterocycles and hydrogen-bond donors (NH) tend to have property values in the **negative to slightly positive range**.
- The presence of **C=O** and **NH** groups in a conjugated system (as in our target) often leads to values between **-1.0 and 0.0**.
- The target molecule is more similar to **Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F** but lacks the electron-withdrawing fluorine, which would likely make its property value slightly more negative.

### Predicted Property Value:
Considering the above, the predicted property value for **O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12** is:  
**-0.65**  

This estimate balances the influence of the fused aromatic system, hydrogen-bonding capability, and comparison to similar molecules in the dataset.

Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.3895547479458299
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O** (methyl acetate), let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Esters and Ethers**:
   - **CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC** (triethyl phosphate): -9.05589717 (highly negative, likely due to the phosphate group).
   - **COc1ccccc1OCC(O)COC(N)=O**: -0.22964074 (moderately negative, complex ester/ether).
   - **CCCOC(C)C**: 0.17242201 (simple ether, slightly positive).
   - **CCOC=C**: 0.60000857 (unsaturated ether, more positive).

2. **Carbonyl-Containing Compounds**:
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: 1.1220402 (steroid-like ketone, highly positive).
   - **CCC(C)C(=O)C**: 0.20577762 (simple ketone, slightly positive).
   - **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1**: -0.56879172 (aromatic aldehyde, moderately negative).

3. **Acetate-like Structures**:
   - **CC(=O)O** (acetic acid) is not in the examples, but esters like **CC(=O)OC** (methyl acetate) are similar to **CC(C)OC=O**.
   - The presence of an ester group (**OC=O**) often gives moderately negative to near-zero values unless other functional groups dominate.

4. **Branching Effects**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol): 0.73876264 (positive, due to branching and OH).
   - **CC(C)(C)C**: 0.4167405 (branched alkane, positive).
   - Branching in **CC(C)OC=O** may slightly increase the property value compared to linear esters.

### Prediction for **CC(C)OC=O**:
- It is a branched ester (methyl acetate analog) with no strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups.
- Similar esters/ethers in the examples have values ranging from slightly negative to slightly positive.
- The carbonyl (C=O) and ether (O) groups may balance out, giving a near-zero or slightly positive value.
- Branching (isopropyl group) may push the value slightly higher.

Given these observations, a reasonable prediction for **CC(C)OC=O** is:  
**0.15** (slightly positive, similar to **CCCOC(C)C** but adjusted for the ester group).  

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at **CCC(C)C(=O)C** (branched ketone, 0.20577762) and **COc1ccc(C=O)cc1** (aromatic aldehyde, -0.56879172), the ester **CC(C)OC=O** likely falls between these. Since it is aliphatic and branched, closer to the ketone:  
**Predicted property value: 0.12** (slightly positive).  

However, considering **CCCOC(C)C** (0.17242201) is a closer structural analog (ether vs. ester), and esters are often slightly more negative than ethers, the final prediction is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.10** (slightly positive but lower than the ether due to the carbonyl).  

### Final Answer:
**0.10**

SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: -1.130892269281641
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Group**: The molecule is a **urea derivative** with two phenyl rings attached to the nitrogen atoms (N-aryl urea). The structure is symmetric, with two aniline (N-phenyl) groups bonded to a central carbonyl (C=O) group.
   - Urea-like structures in the examples:
     - `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (cyclic urea derivative): **-4.15475432**
     - `NC(=O)N` (urea itself, not in the list, but similar to `NC(=S)N` with **0.55019728**).
   - The presence of two aromatic rings and the urea core suggests moderate polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

2. **Aromatic Rings**: Two phenyl rings are present, similar to:
   - `Oc1ccccc1Cl` (phenol with chloro substituent): **-0.36400638**
   - `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` (naphthalene derivative): **-0.75790982**
   - Aromatic rings alone do not dominate the property but contribute to bulkiness and weak interactions.

3. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - The urea group (N-C=O-N) is highly polar and can act as both a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, similar to amides or other urea derivatives in the list.
   - Compare to `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` (carbamate): **-4.28674362**, but this has additional ester-like features.

4. **Symmetry and Size**:
   - The molecule is larger and more symmetric than simple ureas, which may reduce the property magnitude compared to very polar small molecules (e.g., sugars like `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` with **-4.81897433**).

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The closest analog is likely the cyclic urea (`C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` with **-4.15475432**), but our molecule is acyclic and less constrained.
- The presence of two phenyl rings may offset some polarity, pulling the value closer to neutral compared to highly polar small molecules.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance between polarity (urea) and hydrophobicity (phenyl rings), the predicted value should be **moderately negative**, but not as extreme as the cyclic urea or carbamate examples. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -1.5 to -2.0**

For specificity, we can choose a value close to other mid-range polar compounds like `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C` (**-1.9679535**). Thus:

**Final Prediction: -1.85**

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -1.992632244293033
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is **fluorene**, which consists of two benzene rings fused to a central five-membered ring (cyclopentadiene). It is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with significant aromatic character and rigidity.

### Key Observations from Given Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) or fused aromatics tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative. For example:
     - `Sc1ccccc1` (thiophene derivative): **0.031**
     - `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (large PAH): **-0.560**
   - Substitutions (e.g., halogens, polar groups) can shift the value positively or negatively.

2. **Fused Aromatic Systems**:
   - The molecule `c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1` (a larger PAH) has a value of **-0.560**, suggesting that increasing aromaticity/fused rings may slightly decrease the property value.

3. **Fluorene vs. Naphthalene/Biphenyl**:
   - Fluorene is more conjugated and rigid than biphenyl or naphthalene but less extended than the large PAH above. Its value should likely fall between small aromatics (~0) and the large PAH (-0.560).

4. **No Polar Substituents**:
   - Since fluorene has no polar or electronegative substituents (unlike some examples with Cl, F, or O), its value should not be strongly shifted in either direction.

### Prediction:
Given the above, fluorene's property value is likely **slightly negative**, similar to other pure aromatic systems but not as low as larger PAHs. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted value: -0.35**  

This aligns with:
- Simpler aromatics (~0 to -0.5).
- Larger fused systems (e.g., -0.560 for the extended PAH).
- No polar/electronic perturbations. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data.)

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -1.0450777586874898
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - **NC(=N)N**: A guanidine-like group (highly polar, basic).
   - **NS(=O)(=O)**: A sulfonamide group (polar, hydrogen-bonding).
   - **Aromatic ring with NH2**: Aniline-like (polar, hydrogen-bond donor/acceptor).

2. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**:
   - The molecule has multiple hydrogen bond donors (NH, NH2) and acceptors (S=O, N).
   - High polarity due to the sulfonamide and guanidine-like groups.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with sulfonamides (e.g., **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O**, property = -1.0469) tend to have negative values.
   - Molecules with polar groups like amines and sulfonamides often have property values in the range of **-1.0 to 0.5**.
   - The guanidine-like group may increase the value slightly compared to simpler sulfonamides.

4. **Closest Analogues**:
   - **O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12** (property = -0.9346): Polar cyclic amide/sulfonamide-like.
   - **O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O** (property = -1.0469): Sulfonamide + polar heterocycle.
   - The presence of the **guanidine (NC(=N)N)** group may push the value slightly higher than these examples.

### Predicted Property:
Given the high polarity and hydrogen-bonding capacity, but balancing with the negative contributions from sulfonamides in the examples, a reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.75**  

This is based on:
- The sulfonamide group pulling the value toward -1.0.
- The guanidine-like group offsetting this slightly (less negative).
- The aromatic amine (NH2) adding minor polarity. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on trends in the data. If the property is, for example, logP, the value would likely be more negative due to the polar groups.)

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.0261438122903352
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule **CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)**: The molecule has two nitro groups attached to the aromatic ring. From the examples:
   - **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** has a value of **-0.65797142**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O** has a value of **0.86098353**.
   Nitro groups tend to decrease the property value unless balanced by other features.

2. **Trifluoromethyl (C(F)(F)F)**: This is a strongly electron-withdrawing group. In the examples, halogenated aromatic systems (e.g., **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl**) have negative values (e.g., **-0.719754**), but the effect depends on context.

3. **Tertiary amine (CCN(CC(C)=C))**: Alkylamines like **CCN(CC)c1ccccc1** have a value of **-1.01777455**, but the presence of conjugation (C=C) and nitro groups may alter this.

4. **Aromatic system with substitution**: The molecule is a highly substituted benzene ring with multiple electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and CF3), which typically reduce the property value.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O** (0.86098353): This has a nitro group and complex substitution but also a neutral/positive contribution from the heterocycle.
- **Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl** (-0.7680874): Nitro-like groups and halogens reduce the value.
- **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (-0.719754): Halogens and aromaticity give a moderately negative value.

Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro and CF3 groups, combined with the tertiary amine, the property value is likely **negative** and more extreme than simple nitroaromatics. However, the conjugated C=C might slightly offset this.

### Predicted Value:
Considering the above, a reasonable estimate is **-0.95**. This balances the strong electron-withdrawing effects with the slight positive contribution from the amine and conjugation.

**Final Answer:**  
Predicted property value: **-0.95**

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.3895547479458299
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Carbonyl (C=O)**: The presence of a carbonyl group (aldehyde, ketone, ester, etc.) tends to influence the property value. For example:
     - **CCCC=O** (butanal) has a value of **0.60000857**.
     - **O=C1CCCCC1** (cyclohexanone) has a value of **0.23832221**.
     - **CC(=O)N** (acetamide) has a high value of **0.74999629**.
   - **Ethers (C-O-C)**: Ethers generally have moderate to low values unless combined with other polar groups. For example:
     - **CC(C)SC(C)C** (thioether) has **-0.12812072**.
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (ester with aniline) has **-1.90828783**.
   - **Branching**: Branched chains (e.g., **CC(C)O**) tend to have slightly higher values than linear chains (e.g., **CCCCCC(C)O** has **-0.08598968**, while **CCC(C)(C)O** has **0.38892784**).

2. **Specific Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) is not directly in the list, but **CCC(C)(C)O** (tert-butanol) has **0.38892784**, suggesting branching increases the value.
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC** (a complex thiophosphate) has **0.36611731**, showing that S=O/P=O can increase the value.
   - **CC(=O)N** (acetamide) has **0.74999629**, showing the strong effect of C=O + N.

3. **CC(C)OC=O** (isopropyl formate):
   - This is an ester with a branched alkyl group (isopropyl) and a formyl (C=O) group.
   - Esters in the data:
     - **COC(=O)c1cccnc1** has **-0.59790281**.
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** has **-1.90828783** (likely due to the aniline group).
   - The isopropyl group may slightly increase the value compared to linear esters.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of:
- A branched chain (**CC(C)**), which tends to increase the value.
- An ester (**OC=O**), which tends to have moderate values (around **-0.5 to 0.5**).
- No strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups (like Cl or NO2).

The value is likely **slightly positive** due to the branching effect, similar to **CCC(C)(C)O (0.38892784)** but offset by the ester group. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O: 0.25**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) models or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.21300292041459154
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Key Observations:
1. **Presence of Oxygen (O)**:
   - Molecules with hydroxyl groups (-OH) tend to have lower (more negative) property values, especially if the -OH is part of a polar or aromatic system (e.g., `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` has a value of -4.716).
   - However, if the -OH is less polar or part of a less conjugated system, the effect is less pronounced (e.g., `c1ccccc1O` has a value of 0.301).

2. **Aromatic Rings with Alkyl Substituents**:
   - Aromatic rings with simple alkyl groups (e.g., -CH3) tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative (e.g., `Cc1cccc(C)c1` has a value of -0.169, `Cc1cccc(N)c1` has a value of 0.086).
   - The presence of multiple alkyl groups can slightly reduce the property value (e.g., `CCc1ccccc1C` has a value of -0.513).

3. **Combined Effects**:
   - When an aromatic ring has both alkyl groups and a polar substituent (e.g., -OH), the property value tends to be moderately negative, balancing the effects of the alkyl groups (raising the value) and the polar group (lowering the value).

### Analysis of **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**:
- The molecule is a disubstituted benzene ring with:
  - Two methyl groups (-CH3, electron-donating, slightly increasing the property value).
  - One hydroxyl group (-OH, electron-withdrawing and polar, decreasing the property value).
- The hydroxyl group is conjugated with the aromatic ring, enhancing its polar effect, but the two methyl groups counteract this to some extent.
- Similar molecules:
  - `Cc1cccc(C)c1` (two methyl groups, no -OH): -0.169.
  - `c1ccccc1O` (one -OH, no alkyl groups): 0.301.
  - `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` (multiple -OH groups): -4.716 (extreme case due to high polarity).

Given the balance between the two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group, the property value should be slightly negative but not as extreme as highly polar molecules. 

### Predicted Property Value:
A reasonable estimate for **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** is **-0.45**. 

This accounts for:
- The slight reduction due to the -OH group (but not as extreme as in polyhydroxy aromatics).
- The counteracting effect of the two methyl groups.

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the given data. If the property is something like logP or solubility, the reasoning would align well.)

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.42179739769416924
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: 
   - Molecules with the **P(=S)(OC)** group tend to have positive property values, often in the range of **0.9 to 1.6**. Examples:
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl` → **1.28847968**
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl` → **1.59308821**
     - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` → **0.91816815**

2. **Aromatic Substitution**:
   - The presence of electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., Cl, Br) increases the property value.
   - The presence of electron-donating groups (e.g., CH3, OCH3) tends to decrease the property value or have a neutral effect.

3. **Thioether (SC) Group**:
   - The **SC** substituent on the aromatic ring is somewhat analogous to **Cl** or **Br** in terms of electronic effects (moderately electron-withdrawing). However, it is less electronegative than halogens, so its impact may be slightly lower.

4. **Methyl (C) Group**:
   - The **CH3** group is electron-donating and may slightly reduce the property value compared to a halogen-substituted analog.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- The closest analog in the given examples is:
  - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` → **0.91816815** (three Cl substituents)
  - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl` → **1.28847968** (two Cl and one Br)
  - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl` → **1.59308821** (two Cl and one I)

Our molecule has:
- One **SC** group (less electron-withdrawing than Cl/Br/I)
- One **CH3** group (electron-donating)
- No halogens

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, the property value for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** is expected to be:
- Lower than the **P(=S)** examples with halogens (which are in the **0.9–1.6** range).
- Higher than purely aliphatic or electron-donating substituted aromatics (which can be negative or near zero).
- The **SC** group is less impactful than halogens, and the **CH3** group reduces the value further.

A reasonable estimate is **~0.6–0.8**. Given the structural similarity to `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (0.918) but with less electron-withdrawing power, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 0.75** (approximate, likely between 0.7 and 0.8). 

(Note: Without a regression model or more exact analogs, this is a qualitative estimate based on the given examples.)

Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.9642758499578873
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds** tend to have **positive property values**, especially when the chlorination is extensive and symmetric. For example:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a property value of **1.2507042**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a property value of **1.48651445**.

2. The molecule in question (**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**) is very similar to the above examples, with **6 chlorine atoms** attached to two fused aromatic rings (likely a dichlorinated biphenyl or naphthalene-like structure). 

3. The property value increases with the number of chlorines and symmetry. This molecule has one fewer chlorine than **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (which has 8 chlorines and a value of 1.486), but more chlorines than **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (which has 6 chlorines and a value of 1.251).

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity and the trend of increasing property values with chlorination, the predicted property value for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** should be **slightly lower than 1.486** but **higher than 1.251**. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value = 1.35** (rounded to two decimal places). 

### Justification:
- The molecule is less chlorinated than the one with a value of 1.486 but similarly symmetric, so the value should be slightly lower.
- It is more chlorinated than the one with a value of 1.251, so the value should be higher than that.

Thus, the final predicted value is:  
**1.35** (approximate).

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.37540651577611545
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCN(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro Group (NO2)**: 
   - The nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) appears in several molecules, often with a negative impact on the property value. For example:
     - `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (three nitro groups) has a value of **-1.09358075**.
     - `N#Cc1ccccc1C#N` (no nitro group) has a value of **-0.35344316**, while similar aromatic systems with nitro groups tend to be more negative.
   - The nitro group is highly polar and electron-withdrawing, which likely contributes to lowering the property value.

2. **Alkyl Chains**:
   - Simple alkyl chains (e.g., `CCC`) have positive values (e.g., **0.9037335** for `CCC`).
   - When combined with polar groups, the property value tends to decrease. For example:
     - `CCCCCC=O` (alkyl + carbonyl) has **0.20577762**.
     - `CCCCCCCCO` (alkyl + hydroxyl) has **-0.40651912**.

3. **Combination of Alkyl and Nitro**:
   - The molecule `CCCN(=O)=O` has a short alkyl chain (`CCC`) and a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`).
   - The nitro group's strong electron-withdrawing nature will likely dominate, pulling the property value downward compared to pure alkyl chains.
   - Similar molecules with nitro groups (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1O` with **0.05058973**) suggest that nitro groups reduce the property value but not as drastically as multiple nitro groups.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Pure alkyl chains (e.g., `CCC`) have values around **0.9**.
- Nitro groups reduce the value (e.g., trinitrobenzene at **-1.09**).
- A single nitro group on a small alkyl chain would likely reduce the value but not as much as in aromatic systems (due to less conjugation).

A reasonable estimate for `CCCN(=O)=O` would be slightly positive but closer to zero due to the nitro group's effect. 

**Predicted property value: ~0.2**  
(Similar to `CCCCCC=O` at **0.20577762**, where a polar group modestly reduces the alkyl chain's positive contribution.) 

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at `Nc1ccccc1O` (nitro-like effects in an aromatic system) at **0.05058973**, and considering that alkyl chains are less affected by nitro groups than aromatics, the value for `CCCN(=O)=O` might be slightly higher. 

**Final predicted value: 0.25**  
(This balances the alkyl chain's positive contribution and the nitro group's negative pull.) 

However, reviewing `CC(=C)C` (similar small alkyl with slight polarity) at **0.78182543**, and `CCCN(=O)=O` being more polar, a lower value is plausible. 

**Adjusted prediction: 0.15**  
(Closer to `CCCCCC=O` at **0.20577762** but with a stronger polar effect from the nitro group.) 

Given the examples, the most consistent estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.18**  

But to align with the closest analog (`CCCCCC=O` at **0.20577762**), and considering the nitro group is more polar than a carbonyl, the value should be slightly lower. 

**Final answer: 0.10**  

After reconsidering, the nitro group's strong effect likely pulls it closer to zero or slightly negative. Given `Nc1ccccc1O` at **0.05058973**, `CCCN(=O)=O` might be similar or slightly higher due to the alkyl chain. 

**Most precise prediction: 0.05**  

However, comparing to `O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` (**-1.09358075**), a single nitro on an alkyl chain would be much less negative. 

**Final decision: 0.10**  

Thus, the predicted property value for `CCCN(=O)=O` is:  
**0.10**

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -3.0724821365389983
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Observations:
1. **Halogen Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br, F) tend to have negative property values, especially when multiple halogens are present or when they are on aromatic rings.
   - Example: 
     - **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (dihalogenated benzene) has a value of **-2.69499739**.
     - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (polychlorinated biphenyl) has a value of **0.5993873**, but this is an outlier likely due to the large size and symmetry.
     - **BrC(Br)Br** (bromoform) has a very small value (**0.0078757**), suggesting halogens on aliphatic carbons have less impact.

2. **Aromatic Systems with Single Halogens**:
   - **COc1cccc(Cl)c1** and **COc1ccccc1Cl** (chlorinated anisoles) both have the same value (**-0.77086304**).
   - **Fc1ccc(F)cc1** (difluorobenzene) is not in the examples, but **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (chloro-bromobenzene) is very negative (**-2.69499739**), suggesting that combining different halogens on an aromatic ring strongly reduces the property value.

3. **Fluorine vs. Bromine**:
   - Fluorine is more electronegative than bromine, but bromine is larger and more polarizable. In the given examples, bromine substitution tends to correlate with more negative values than fluorine alone (though no mono-fluorinated examples are provided).

4. **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**:
   - This is a mono-fluorinated and mono-brominated benzene, similar to **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** but with F instead of Cl. 
   - Fluorine is smaller and less polarizable than chlorine, so the effect might be slightly less negative than **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (-2.69499739), but still significantly negative due to the presence of two different halogens.

### Prediction:
Given the strong negative effect of mixed halogen substitution on aromatic rings (as seen in **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**), and assuming fluorine has a slightly weaker effect than chlorine, a reasonable estimate for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** would be slightly less negative than **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**.

**Predicted property value: -2.3**  
(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For precise predictions, a model trained on more data would be needed.)

To predict the property for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule is a bicyclic system with a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to one of the rings. It has two quaternary carbons (fully substituted carbons, denoted by "C1(C)") and a tertiary alcohol (C-OH). 
2. **Functional Groups**: 
   - Hydroxyl group (-OH), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
   - No highly electronegative atoms (like halogens) or strongly electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro or carbonyl groups in the given examples that significantly increase the property value).
3. **Size and Complexity**: It is a mid-sized bicyclic molecule, similar in complexity to some of the steroids or polycyclic examples in the dataset (e.g., **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO**, which has a high property value of 1.712). However, this molecule lacks the additional polar groups (e.g., carbonyl, fluorine) that might drive the property value higher.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **CC(C)(C)CO** (property = 0.3889): A simple tertiary alcohol with a small hydrocarbon chain. The presence of -OH gives it a modest positive value.
- **CC1CCCO1** (property = 0.4174): A cyclic ether with a small hydrocarbon substituent. The oxygen in the ring contributes to a slightly higher value.
- **CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO** (property = 1.712): A complex polycyclic steroid with multiple polar groups (carbonyl, hydroxyl, fluorine). This has a much higher value due to the cumulative effect of these groups.
- **CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2** (property = 1.461): Another polycyclic system with halogen and ester groups, contributing to a high value.

### Prediction:
The molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** has a hydroxyl group but lacks other strongly polar or electron-withdrawing groups. It is less complex than the high-value steroids but more complex than simple alcohols. Based on the examples:
- The hydroxyl group will contribute a modest positive value (similar to **CC(C)(C)CO**).
- The bicyclic structure may slightly increase the value compared to simpler alcohols, but not as much as polycyclic systems with additional polar groups.

Given this, a reasonable estimate would be in the range of **0.4 to 0.6**. Averaging this and considering the examples, I predict:

**Predicted property value: 0.55** (rounded from a plausible range of 0.4–0.6). 

This aligns with the trend where hydroxylated polycyclic systems without additional polar groups have values in this intermediate range.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.685412667916875
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The molecule in question is:

**CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**

This molecule shares structural similarities with two examples from the dataset:

1. **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O** (Property: **1.47723653**)
   - This molecule has a thiophosphoryl group (P=S) with an OCC and SC(CCl) substituent, along with a similar lactam (N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O) structure.

2. **CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3ccccc23** (Property: **9.53e-06**)
   - This molecule has a simpler lactam structure without the thiophosphoryl group.

The molecule we are predicting (**CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**) has:
- A thiophosphoryl group (P=S) with two OCC substituents (similar to the first example but without the SC(CCl) group).
- The same lactam structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O) as in both examples.

### Key Observations:
- The presence of the **P=S** group seems to correlate with higher property values (e.g., 1.47723653 in the first example).
- The lactam structure alone (without P=S) gives a much lower value (9.53e-06 in the second example).
- The substituents on the P=S group also matter: **OCC** is less bulky/electron-withdrawing than **SC(CCl)**, which might slightly reduce the property value compared to the first example.

### Prediction:
The molecule is very similar to the first example but lacks the **SC(CCl)** group, which likely reduces the property value slightly. However, the **P=S** and lactam structure should still dominate, leading to a relatively high value. 

Given these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** is:

**1.35** (approximate, likely between 1.2 and 1.5 based on the trend). 

However, since the first example with a very similar structure has a value of **1.47723653**, and the only major difference is the replacement of **SC(CCl)** with **OCC**, the property value should be slightly lower but still close. 

Thus, a more precise prediction would be:

**1.40** (rounded from an estimated slight decrease from 1.477). 

But to match the precision of the given examples, I will predict:

**1.45** (as the OCC substituent is less bulky but still similar in electronic effects). 

### Final Answer:
**1.45** (approximate, based on structural similarity to the example with value 1.47723653). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trend in the data. The true value could vary slightly depending on the specific property and its sensitivity to substituent effects.)

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -3.2589524104151164
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or structural features that correlate with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, heterocycles)**:
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., `c1ccccc1`) often have property values close to zero or slightly negative (e.g., `CNc1ccccc1` = 0.086, `c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32` = -2.078).
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., carbonyl, nitro) tend to decrease the property value (e.g., `O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` = -8.258).
   - Aromatic rings with electron-donating groups (e.g., methoxy, methyl) may slightly increase the property value (e.g., `COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` = 1.131).

2. **Carbonyl groups (C=O)**:
   - Carbonyl groups in aliphatic chains (e.g., `CCC(=O)C` = 0.600) tend to increase the property value.
   - Carbonyl groups in aromatic or conjugated systems (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC` = -0.620) tend to decrease the property value.

3. **Heterocycles with nitrogen or oxygen**:
   - Nitrogen-containing heterocycles (e.g., pyridine, imidazole) often have negative property values (e.g., `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2` = -0.897).
   - Oxygen-containing heterocycles (e.g., furan, dioxane) may have slightly positive or negative values depending on substitution.

4. **Substituents**:
   - Methyl groups (`C`) often slightly increase the property value (e.g., `CCCC(C)(C)C` = 0.205).
   - Halogens (Cl, Br, F) tend to decrease the property value (e.g., `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` = -2.039).

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** has the following features:
1. A **diazole ring** (`n1`) with a **carbonyl group (C=O)** conjugated to the aromatic system.
2. A **methyl group (`C`)** attached to the diazole ring.
3. A **phenyl ring (`c2ccccc2`)** fused to the diazole ring.
4. The structure resembles a **benzodiazepine-like** system with electron-withdrawing carbonyl and nitrogen atoms.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- `Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (methylated diazole) = -0.897
- `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC` (carbonyl + nitrogen heterocycle) = -0.620
- `c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32` (fused aromatic + nitrogen) = -2.078

The target molecule has both a conjugated carbonyl and nitrogen heterocycle, which likely reduces the property value. However, the methyl groups may slightly offset this effect.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the structural similarities to molecules with property values between **-0.6 and -0.9**, and considering the additional phenyl ring (which may further decrease the value), the predicted property for **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** is:

**-0.75** (approximate midpoint of the range observed for similar structures). 

(Note: This is an educated estimate based on the given examples; precise prediction would require a quantitative structure-property relationship model.)

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.8272509437569734
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Polarity**:
   - Molecules with highly polar groups (e.g., multiple hydroxyls, carboxylic acids, or phosphates) tend to have lower (more negative) property values. 
     - Example: `COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1` (multiple -OH and -COOH) has a value of **-4.716**.
     - `CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC` (phosphate group) has a very low value of **-9.056**.
   - Nonpolar or weakly polar molecules (e.g., hydrocarbons, halogens, esters) tend to have higher (more positive) values.
     - Example: `CCC(=C)C` (hydrocarbon) has a value of **0.624**.
     - `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` (chlorinated aromatic) has a high value of **1.251**.

2. **Molecular Size and Complexity**:
   - Larger, more complex molecules (e.g., steroids, fused rings) often have intermediate values unless they contain highly polar groups.
     - Example: `CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(=O)C2` (steroid-like) has a value of **-1.146**.
     - `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO` (complex steroid) has a value of **1.001**.

3. **Specific Functional Groups**:
   - Esters (`-COOR`) tend to have moderately positive values unless paired with other polar groups.
     - Example: `CCOC(=O)N` (ester) has a value of **0.375**.
     - `CC(C)OC(=O)C` (ester) has a value of **0.173**.
   - Carboxylic acids (`-COOH`) or their derivatives (e.g., esters, amides) can vary but often lean toward negative values if free -OH is present.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule: **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**
- This is **ethyl hexanoate**, an ester with the structure:
  - A 6-carbon aliphatic chain (`CCCCCC-`).
  - An ester group (`-COO-`) linked to an ethyl group (`-OCC`).
- Key features:
  - No highly polar groups (no -OH, -NH, etc.).
  - The ester group is moderately polar but not as polar as free -COOH or multiple -OH groups.
  - The molecule is largely hydrophobic with a small polar region.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
1. `CCOC(=O)N` (ethyl carbamate): **0.375** (ester + amide, slightly polar).
2. `CC(C)OC(=O)C` (isopropyl acetate): **0.173** (ester, less polar than above).
3. `CCC(=O)OCC` (ethyl propionate): Not in the list, but similar to the target.
4. `CCCC` (butane): **0.599** (pure hydrocarbon, high value).
5. `CCCCC(=O)O` (pentanoic acid): Not in the list, but free -COOH would likely lower the value.

### Prediction:
- The target molecule is an ester with a longer hydrocarbon chain, which reduces overall polarity compared to smaller esters. 
- It lacks additional polar groups, so the value should be moderately positive, similar to other esters but slightly lower due to the longer hydrophobic tail.
- Expected range: **0.1 to 0.4**.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is approximately **0.25**. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or another descriptor—this is an educated estimate based on the given examples.)

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.5687917237021894
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can analyze the given molecule **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** (methyl benzoate) and predict its property value by comparing it to structurally similar molecules in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Ester Functional Group (-COO-)**:  
   - The molecule contains an ester group, similar to:  
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (ethyl benzoate), which has a property value of **-1.05665033**.  
     - **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1** (ethyl 4-hydroxybenzoate), which has a value of **-1.9886694**.  
   - The presence of an additional hydroxyl group in the second example lowers the value further, suggesting that the ester alone (without extra polar groups) tends toward moderately negative values.

2. **Aromatic Ring**:  
   - The benzene ring is a common feature in many examples, and its substitution pattern affects the property. Simple benzoates (like methyl or ethyl benzoate) tend to cluster around **-1.0 to -1.5**.

3. **Methyl vs. Ethyl Substituent**:  
   - Comparing **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (-1.056) and **COC(=O)c1ccccc1**, the methyl variant (shorter alkyl chain) might have a slightly less negative value due to reduced hydrophobicity compared to ethyl.  

4. **Other Similar Examples**:  
   - **CCOC(=O)c1cncn1C(C)c2ccccc2** (a more complex ester) has a value of **-0.16233868**, but this includes additional nitrogen heterocycles, which likely increase the value.  
   - Simple esters without extra polar groups (like methyl benzoate) are more comparable to ethyl benzoate (-1.056).

### Prediction:  
Given the structural similarity to **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1** (-1.056) and the trend that methyl substituents often result in slightly less negative values than ethyl, the predicted property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is approximately:  

**-0.95**  

(Note: This is an estimate based on the dataset's trends; the actual value may vary slightly but should fall close to this range.)  

---  
**Final Answer:**  
The predicted property value for **COC(=O)c1ccccc1** is **-0.95**.
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.647691958085121
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The molecule in question is **C=CCC=C** (1,3-butadiene), which is a simple conjugated diene.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkenes (C=C)**: 
   - **C/C=C/C** (2-butene) has a property value of **0.62379954**.
   - **C=Cc1ccccc1** (styrene) has a property value of **0.1389184**.
   - The presence of conjugation (alternating single and double bonds) tends to lower the property value slightly compared to isolated double bonds.

2. **Saturated Hydrocarbons**:
   - **C1CCCC1** (cyclopentane) has a property value of **0.62379954** (same as 2-butene, interestingly).
   - **CCC(C)(C)CC** (branched alkane) has a property value of **0.20505842**.

3. **Conjugated Systems**:
   - Conjugation (as in 1,3-butadiene) often reduces the property value compared to isolated double bonds or alkanes, but the effect is not drastic.

### Prediction for **C=CCC=C**:
- 1,3-Butadiene is a conjugated diene, and its property value is likely to be slightly lower than that of 2-butene (**0.62379954**) but higher than styrene (**0.1389184**), which has additional aromatic stabilization.
- A reasonable estimate would be between **0.4** and **0.6**.
- Given the examples, a plausible prediction is **~0.5**.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**0.50000000** (rounded to match the precision of the provided examples). 

This is an educated guess based on the trends observed in the data. For a more precise prediction, additional examples or a clear definition of the property would be needed.

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.00787570272091629
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **BrC(Br)Br** (tribromomethane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobenzene derivative) has a high positive value (**1.48651445**).
   - **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (chlorinated biphenyl) has a negative value (**-1.71841599**).
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (brominated biphenyl) has a negative value (**-1.38308213**).
   - **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (halogenated alkane) has a negative value (**-2.03955211**).

   Halogenation generally seems to reduce the property value, especially with multiple halogens (e.g., **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** is very negative).

2. **Brominated Alkanes**:
   - **BrC(Br)Br** is a fully brominated methane analog. Comparing to **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br**, which has a similar structure but with mixed halogens and a value of **-2.03955211**, we might expect **BrC(Br)Br** to be slightly less negative because bromine is less electronegative than fluorine or chlorine.

3. **Simple Halogenated Methanes**:
   - No direct examples of **CX3** (where X is halogen) are given, but **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a trichloromethyl group attached to a phosphate ester) has a positive value (**0.09418603**), suggesting that the property is influenced by the rest of the molecule. For **BrC(Br)Br**, the lack of other functional groups would likely make the value more negative.

4. **Trend for Multiple Halogens**:
   - Multiple halogens (especially electronegative ones like F or Cl) tend to make the property more negative. Bromine is less electronegative, so the effect would be less pronounced than in **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** but still significant.

### Prediction:
Given the fully brominated methane structure and the trend from similar halogenated compounds, **BrC(Br)Br** is expected to have a **negative property value**, likely between **-1.0 and -2.0**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br: -1.75**  
(This is an interpolation based on the examples, especially **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** at **-2.03955211** and less negative brominated aromatics like **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** at **-1.38308213**). 

### Note:
Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, dipole moment, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given data. The value is likely closer to **-1.75** due to the symmetric, fully brominated nature of the molecule.

Iteration: 39
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 1.4772365282028883
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S))**: Present in the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**, which has a property value of **1.30194827**. This suggests that the P(=S) group may contribute positively to the property value.
2. **Aromatic rings (c1ccccc1)**: Aromatic rings are common in many of the examples, and their contribution varies. For instance:
   - **c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2** has a value of **-4.65877853**, but this includes a hydroxyl group.
   - **N#Cc1ccccc1** has a value of **0.15646185**.
   - The presence of aromatic rings alone does not drastically lower the value.
3. **Chlorine (Cl)**: The molecule has a **CCl** group. Chlorine substituents are present in many examples, and their effect depends on the context. For example:
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** has a value of **-0.97837341**.
   - **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a value of **1.48651445**.
   - Chlorine can either increase or decrease the property value, but in this case, it is part of a larger functional group (CCl attached to S).
4. **Lactam (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: This is a cyclic amide (lactam) fused to an aromatic ring. Similar structures like **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccccc1** have a value of **-1.83246102**, but this is a linear amide. Lactams may have different effects.
5. **Ethoxy groups (CCO)**: These are present as substituents on the phosphorus (OCC). Alkoxy groups are generally neutral or slightly positive contributors.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The molecule **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (value: **1.30194827**) is structurally similar, with a P(=S) group, aromatic ring, and chlorine substituent. Our target molecule also has these features but includes a lactam and an additional ethoxy group.
- The lactam may slightly reduce the value compared to the linear amide in the reference molecule, but the ethoxy groups could offset this.

### Predicted Value:
Given the similarities to **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (value: **1.30194827**) but with additional complexity (lactam, extra ethoxy), the property value is likely in a similar range but slightly lower due to the lactam's potential negative contribution. 

**Predicted property value: 1.10** (approximate, based on structural similarity and trends in the examples). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the given data. The value could vary slightly depending on the specific property's dependence on substructures.)

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 1.0742205327512655
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a plausible value.

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Amide group (C(=O)N)**: Present in multiple examples, often associated with moderate negative or near-zero values (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C` = -0.085, `CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O` = -0.748).
2. **Aromatic ring with chlorine substitution**: Chlorinated aromatics tend to lower the property (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` = -1.409, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` = -0.978).
3. **Heterocyclic fragment (n2nc(oc2=O))**: Similar to nitro or other electron-withdrawing groups, which often reduce the property (e.g., `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` = -0.791).
4. **Bulky tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)**: Alkyl groups can slightly increase the property, but their effect is often overshadowed by polar/electron-withdrawing groups.
5. **Polar/ionizable groups (N, O, Cl)**: These typically decrease the property, especially when combined (e.g., `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` = -2.162).

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- The closest analogs are molecules with amides, chlorinated aromatics, and heterocycles, which generally have **negative property values** between -0.5 and -2.0.
- The presence of **two strong electron-withdrawing groups (Cl and the heterocycle)** suggests a value toward the lower end of this range.

### Predicted Value:
Given the combined effects of the amide, chlorine, and heterocycle, the property is likely **between -1.0 and -1.5**. A reasonable estimate is:  
**-1.25** (specific value: **-1.25000000**).

### Rationale:
- The amide and chlorine alone would suggest ~-1.0 (e.g., `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` = -1.145).
- The additional heterocycle (similar to nitro groups in impact) further reduces the value by ~0.1–0.3.
- The tert-butyl group has a negligible positive offset.

Thus, the final prediction is:  
**-1.25000000**.

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 0.5692513038967916
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values. 

### Observations from the given data:
1. **Presence of halogens (Cl, Br, F)**:
   - Molecules with multiple Cl atoms tend to have negative property values (e.g., `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` has a value of -0.45987854, `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` has -0.719754).
   - The more Cl atoms, the more negative the property tends to be (but not strictly linear).

2. **Presence of hydroxyl groups (-OH)**:
   - Molecules with -OH groups often have negative or moderately negative values (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` has -1.74509905, `OCC(O)C(O)CO` has -0.21195319).

3. **Aromatic systems with substitutions**:
   - Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (Cl, NO2) tend to lower the property value (e.g., `Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` has -0.3396183, `O=N(=O)c1c(Cl)c(Cl)ccc1` has -2.61926467).
   - Aromatic rings with electron-donating groups (OH, OCH3) can slightly increase or decrease the value depending on other substituents.

4. **Symmetry and multiple substitutions**:
   - Symmetrical molecules with repeating units (like the target molecule) often have additive effects. For example, `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl` is like two `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` units linked, which has a value of -1.74509905. Doubling this would suggest ~-3.49, but this is likely an overestimation due to non-additive effects.

### Target Molecule Analysis:
- The molecule is **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**, which consists of two phenol rings linked by an ether bridge, with Cl substitutions:
  - 3 Cl atoms total (one on the first ring, two on the second).
  - 2 OH groups (one on each ring).
  - Aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing (Cl) and electron-donating (OH) groups.

### Similar Molecules in the Dataset:
1. `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (one phenol ring with 2 Cl): **-1.74509905**
2. `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` (two aromatic rings with 2 Cl): **-0.719754**
3. `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (one phenol ring with 4 Cl): **-0.45987854**

The target molecule is intermediate in Cl count (3 Cl) but has two phenol rings. The value is likely more negative than `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (-1.745) but less negative than a fully chlorinated system (e.g., `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` with 4 Cl is -0.459, but this is less negative due to steric/electronic saturation).

### Prediction:
Given the above, a reasonable estimate is between **-2.0 and -3.0**. A good midpoint is around **-2.5**. 

However, looking at the trend:
- `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (2 Cl): -1.745
- `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl` (3 Cl): Likely more negative than -1.745 but not as extreme as -3.0. 

A refined guess is **-2.2**.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
**-2.2** (approximate, based on trends in the data). 

Note: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, dipole moment, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given examples. The true value could vary slightly, but this is a plausible prediction given the data.

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.6237995354646122
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property value for the molecule **CC/C=C\C** (which is equivalent to **CC=CC**, 2-butene) can be predicted by comparing it to similar structures in the dataset. 

From the examples:
- **CC/C=C/C** (1-butene) has a property value of **0.62379954**.
- **CCCC** (butane) is not explicitly listed, but **CCCC(C)C** (2-methylpentane) has a value of **0.4167405**, and **CCCCS** (butyl mercaptan) has a value of **0.35952018**.

Since **CC/C=C\C** (2-butene) is structurally very similar to **CC/C=C/C** (1-butene), but with a slightly different double bond position, we can expect its property value to be close to that of 1-butene. 

### Predicted property value for **CC/C=C\C**:  
**~0.60** (likely slightly lower than 1-butene due to minor structural differences, but still in the same range).

*(Exact prediction: ~0.60, but if forced to pick a precise value, I’d estimate **0.58** based on the trend.)*

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 0.3889278361632943
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOCC** (diethyl ether), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Ether Functional Group (-O-)**:
   - **CCOC(=O)C** (ethyl acetate) has a property value of **-0.08509586**.
   - **CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2** (a more complex ether) has a value of **0.70866592**.
   - **COc1ccccc1O** (anisole-like) has a value of **-0.25780587**.
   - Ethers generally seem to have values in the range of **-0.25 to 0.7**, depending on complexity and substituents.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - **CC(C)O** (isopropanol) has a value of **0.73876264**, while **CC(C)Cl** has **0.51929494**.
   - **CCC(O)CC** (pentanol-like) has **0.38892784**.
   - Longer or branched chains tend to reduce the property value slightly compared to simpler ethers.

3. **Simple Ethers**:
   - **CCCOCC** is a simple, symmetrical ether with no additional functional groups or branching. Based on the examples, simple ethers like this tend to have values in the **0.3 to 0.6** range.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **CC(C)O** (isopropanol, similar size but with -OH instead of -O-) has **0.73876264**.
- **CCC(O)CC** (similar size but with -OH) has **0.38892784**.
- **CCOC(=O)C** (ethyl acetate, more polar) has **-0.08509586**.
- **CCCOCC** is less polar than alcohols but more polar than hydrocarbons, so its value should be between these examples.

### Predicted Value:
Given the symmetry and simplicity of **CCCOCC**, and comparing it to similar-sized molecules with ether or alcohol functionalities, a reasonable estimate is:  
**0.45**

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CCCOCC** is **0.45**.

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.27536317730572757
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Functional Groups**:
   - **Amide group**: `C(=O)N` (present in many examples, often associated with moderate property values).
   - **Tert-butyl group**: `C(C)(C)` (bulky hydrophobic group, may lower the property value slightly).
   - **Two aromatic rings**: `c1ccccc1` and `c2ccccc2` (common in the dataset, with varying effects depending on substitution).

2. **Similar Molecules in the Dataset**:
   - **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** has a property of **0.67485343**. This molecule also has an amide linked to two aromatic rings (one with a heterocycle) and a similar `N-aryl` motif.
   - **Nc1cccc2ccccc12** has a property of **-0.79149446**, but this is an unsubstituted aromatic amine, which is less comparable.
   - **C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (a simple biphenyl-like structure) has a very low value of **-7.90751624**, but this lacks polar functional groups.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The amide group (`C(=O)N`) tends to increase the property value compared to purely hydrophobic structures (e.g., alkanes or simple aromatics).
   - The presence of two aromatic rings with no strongly electron-withdrawing or donating groups (like nitro or hydroxyl) suggests a moderate value.
   - The bulky `C(C)(C)` group may slightly reduce the property due to steric hindrance or reduced solubility.

### Prediction:
Given the similarities to **CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3** (property = **0.67485343**), but with a less polar `tert-butyl` group replacing the heterocycle, we expect a slightly lower value. A reasonable estimate would be in the range of **0.4 to 0.6**.

### Final Predicted Value:
**0.52** (specific value chosen based on interpolation of similar examples). 

This balances the amide's contribution (~0.6-0.7) with the tert-butyl's reduction (~0.1-0.2).

Iteration: 45
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -1.0529219488935675
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The molecule in question is **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1**, which is **N-(4-bromophenyl)acetamide**. 

### Key structural features influencing the property:
1. **Aromatic ring (phenyl group)** – Generally contributes to moderate property values, often negative or near zero unless strongly influenced by other substituents.
2. **Bromine substituent (Br)** – Bromine tends to decrease the property value (e.g., `Fc1cccc(Br)c1` has a value of `-3.07248214`, `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` has `-2.74056927`).
3. **Amide group (N-C=O)** – The presence of an amide (especially acetyl amide) tends to reduce the property value (e.g., `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` has `0.27536318`, but simpler amides like in peptides can lead to more negative values).
4. **Electron-withdrawing effects** – The combined effect of Br and the amide group likely pulls the property toward negative values.

### Comparison with similar molecules:
- `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` → `-2.74056927` (phenol with Br, very negative)
- `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1` → `-0.92971337` (dichlorobenzene, moderately negative)
- `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` → `0.08629489` (toluidine, slightly positive due to NH2)
- `CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` → `-0.27391417` (amide with aromatic groups, slightly negative)

### Prediction:
The molecule **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** has both an electron-withdrawing Br and an amide group, which will likely result in a **moderately negative property value**, but not as extreme as phenol-Br due to the less polar amide linkage compared to OH.

**Predicted property value: `-0.65`**  
*(Estimated range: between `-0.5` and `-0.8` based on similar structures.)*  

*(Note: This is an educated guess based on the given examples, as no explicit regression or quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model is applied.)*

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.5137446980299264
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Alkyl-Substituted Aromatics**:
   - **Cc1ccccc1N**: 0.08629489 (methyl-substituted benzene with an amine)
   - **Cc1ccccc1**: Likely similar to the above but without the amine (not directly given, but inferred)
   - **CCc1ccc(C)cc1**: -0.16965113 (ethyl and methyl-substituted benzene)
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1**: -0.5137447 (isopropyl and methyl-substituted benzene)
   - **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1**: This is **isopropylbenzene (cumene)**, which has an isopropyl group attached to a benzene ring.

2. **Trends**:
   - Adding alkyl groups (especially branched ones like isopropyl) to benzene tends to **decrease** the property value compared to simpler alkylbenzenes (e.g., toluene or ethylbenzene).
   - The isopropyl group in **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** gives a value of -0.5137447, but this molecule also has an additional methyl group, which may further decrease the value.
   - **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** has only an isopropyl group, so its value should be higher (less negative) than -0.5137447 but lower than simpler alkylbenzenes like toluene (~0.086) or ethylbenzene (-0.169).

3. **Similar Structures**:
   - **CCCC(C)O** (branched alkyl chain with OH): 0.38892784
   - **CC(C)CO** (small branched alcohol): 0.57524162
   - The isopropyl group alone doesn't drastically reduce the value unless combined with other features.

### Prediction:
For **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (isopropylbenzene), the property value is likely between **-0.2 and -0.4**, considering:
- It's less negative than **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (-0.513) because it lacks the additional methyl group.
- It's more negative than **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (-0.169) because the isopropyl group is bulkier than ethyl.

A reasonable estimate is **-0.25**.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1: -0.25**
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.10460749795415054
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and analyzing the molecular structure of **O=Cc1ccccc1** (benzaldehyde), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule has an aldehyde group (**O=C**) attached to a benzene ring. This is somewhat similar to:
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (property = **-0.59790281**), which has an amide and hydroxyl group.
   - **COc1ccccc1** (property = **0.06859757**), which has a methoxy group.
   - **c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45** (property = **-9.53e-06**), a polyaromatic hydrocarbon.

2. **Electron-Withdrawing Nature**: The aldehyde group is moderately electron-withdrawing, which may lower the property value compared to purely hydrocarbon or electron-donating substituents (e.g., **COc1ccccc1** has a positive value).

3. **Aromaticity**: The benzene ring contributes to stability, but the aldehyde group introduces polarity, likely reducing the property value compared to non-polar analogs.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **COc1ccccc1** (methoxybenzene, **+0.06859757**) has an electron-donating group, giving a slightly positive value.
- **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (amide + phenol, **-0.59790281**) has two polar groups, resulting in a more negative value.
- **c1cncnc1** (polar heterocycle, **+0.49913005**) is less comparable but shows that polar groups don't always lead to negative values.

Given that the aldehyde is less electron-donating than a methoxy group but more polar than a simple hydrocarbon, I estimate the property for **O=Cc1ccccc1** to be **slightly negative**, similar to but less extreme than the amide-phenol example.

### Predicted Property Value:
**-0.45** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures).  

This aligns with the trend where:
- Non-polar or weakly polar aromatic systems have values near zero or slightly positive.
- Polar substituents (especially electron-withdrawing ones) reduce the value.
- The aldehyde is less polar than a nitro group (e.g., **O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, **-2.16209103**) but more polar than a methoxy group.  

Thus, **-0.45** is a reasonable estimate.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.3012940762170303
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**:
   - Two amide groups (`C(=O)N`), one of which is part of a cyclic urea-like structure (diketopiperazine-like).
   - A nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) attached to an aromatic ring.
   - An aromatic heterocycle (furan-like, `o1`).
   - A conjugated system with alternating single and double bonds.

2. **Polarity and Electron Effects**:
   - The nitro group is strongly electron-withdrawing, which may decrease the property value (as seen in other nitro-containing molecules like `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` with a value of 0.499).
   - The amide groups are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding, which may also influence the property.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - Molecules with nitro groups and aromatic systems tend to have property values in the range of **0.2 to 0.6** (e.g., `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` at 0.499, `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` at 0.275).
   - The cyclic urea/amide structure is somewhat similar to `c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2` (property = -0.146), but the nitro group and additional conjugation here likely increase the value.

4. **Hybridization and Conjugation**:
   - The extended conjugation (aromatic + amide + nitro) may stabilize the molecule, leading to a moderately positive property value.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of electron-withdrawing (nitro) and polar (amide) groups, along with the aromatic and conjugated system, the property value is likely in the **middle range** of the examples, similar to other nitro-aromatic-amide systems. 

A reasonable prediction is:  
**0.45** (approximate, based on structural similarity to molecules like `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` at 0.499 and `CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` at 0.275). 

### Refined Estimate:
Considering the additional cyclic constraint and the furan ring (which may slightly lower the value compared to pure phenyl systems), the final predicted value is:  
**0.42** (specific property value).

**Answer:** The predicted property value for **O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2** is approximately **0.42**.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -4.656305431896166
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might correlate with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Aromatic Systems with Nitrogen Substituents**:
   - **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline) has a property value of **0.31602049**.
   - **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (a diazo compound linking two phenyl rings) has a very low property value of **-8.22209471**, likely due to the highly conjugated and electron-withdrawing nature of the diazo group.

2. **Structure of the Target Molecule**:
   - The target molecule is **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**, which is a diphenylamine derivative (two phenyl rings linked by a nitrogen atom). This is distinct from the diazo compound but shares some similarity in having two phenyl rings connected via a nitrogen-containing group.

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**:
   - The diphenylamine structure is less electron-withdrawing than the diazo group, so its property value should be less negative.
   - The presence of two phenyl rings with a neutral nitrogen linker (no formal charge or strong electron-withdrawing effect) suggests a property value closer to simple aromatic amines like aniline but possibly slightly lower due to increased conjugation.

4. **Other Examples**:
   - Molecules with extended conjugation (e.g., polyaromatics) tend to have moderately negative values (e.g., **-0.18369914** for **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34**).
   - The diphenylamine structure is less conjugated than fused polyaromatics, so its value should be less negative than these.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Aniline (single phenyl + NH2) has a value of **0.31602049**.
- The diazo-linked biphenyl has **-8.22209471** (extreme due to the diazo group).
- The diphenylamine structure is intermediate, likely with a slightly negative value due to mild conjugation effects.

A reasonable estimate for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is **-0.5 to -1.0**. Looking at similar structures (e.g., **Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34** at **-0.18369914**), the diphenylamine might be slightly more negative due to the flexibility of the nitrogen linker allowing better conjugation.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.6** (approximate; exact value would require more precise modeling, but this aligns with the trends in the data). 

For consistency with the given examples, a plausible specific value is:  
**-0.75**.  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the provided data.)  

**Answer:** The predicted property value for **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is approximately **-0.75**.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -8.721284310125647
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: 
   - The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclic structure with a five-membered ring (**CCCC1**). 
   - It resembles a cyclic imide (two amides fused to a ring), which is a polar and rigid structure.

2. **Polarity and Rigidity**: 
   - Cyclic imides are highly polar due to the presence of two carbonyl groups and nitrogen. 
   - The rigidity of the ring system may reduce conformational flexibility, which can influence the property.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1** (property = -4.15475432): This is a similar cyclic urea/amide structure but with additional alkyl substituents. Its very low value suggests that bulky substituents or specific conformations can drastically reduce the property.
   - **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (property = -0.62000871): Another cyclic imide with alkyl chains, yielding a moderately negative value.
   - **O=C1CCCN1** (property = 0.43162075): A simpler lactam (cyclic amide) with a positive value, suggesting that less substituted cyclic amides may have higher values.

4. **Key Differences**:
   - The target molecule is a symmetric cyclic imide with no additional substituents (just the core ring and amides). 
   - It lacks bulky groups or extended alkyl chains, which in other examples tend to lower the property value.

### Prediction:
Given the symmetry, lack of bulky substituents, and high polarity, the property value is likely to be **positive but not extremely high**. A reasonable estimate would be close to **0.5**, similar to simpler cyclic amides like **O=C1CCCN1** (0.43162075) but slightly higher due to the additional carbonyl group.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.09613839357170537
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples:

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Heavy halogen substitution**: The molecule is a biphenyl derivative with **three chlorine atoms** (two on one ring, one on the other). From the examples, heavily halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have higher property values:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (hexachlorinated biphenyl-like structure) has a value of **1.20198495**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (dichlorobenzene) has a value of **-0.92971337**.
   - The presence of more chlorines generally increases the property value.

2. **Biphenyl scaffold**: The molecule is a **biphenyl** (two benzene rings linked directly). From the examples:
   - **C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13** (polycyclic aromatic) has a value of **-0.96306466**, but this is a fused system, not biphenyl.
   - Biphenyls with substituents (like halogens) tend to have higher values than unsubstituted ones.

3. **Symmetry and conjugation**: The molecule is symmetric with conjugated rings, which may stabilize the system and influence the property.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, which has a value of **1.20198495**. However, this molecule has **six chlorines**, whereas our target has **three chlorines**.
- The dichlorobenzene example (**Clc1ccccc1Cl**) has a much lower value (**-0.92971337**), but our molecule is more complex (biphenyl + 3 chlorines).

### Prediction:
Given the biphenyl core and three chlorines (less than the hexachlorinated example but more than dichlorobenzene), the property value should be **intermediate**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.75**

This is based on:
- The hexachlorinated biphenyl-like structure at **1.20**.
- The dichlorobenzene at **-0.93**.
- The additional conjugation and symmetry of the biphenyl scaffold pushing the value higher than simple chlorinated benzenes but not as high as the heavily chlorinated example. 

Thus, **0.75** is a plausible prediction.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.5137446980299264
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and analyzing the molecular structure of **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** (diethylbenzene), I can predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset. Here's my reasoning:

1. **Structural Features**:
   - The molecule is a simple aromatic hydrocarbon with two ethyl substituents (non-polar, hydrophobic groups).
   - Similar examples in the dataset include:
     - **Cc1ccccc1N** (methyl-substituted benzene with an amino group): **0.08629489**
     - **CCCCCCc1ccccc1** (hexylbenzene): **-1.6950235**
     - **CCc1ccccn1** (ethyl-substituted pyridine): **0.08629489**

2. **Key Observations**:
   - The presence of alkyl groups (ethyl in this case) on an aromatic ring tends to result in property values close to zero, slightly positive or negative depending on the size of the alkyl group.
   - Smaller alkyl groups (like ethyl) seem to correlate with values around **0.08 to 0.2**, while longer alkyl chains (like hexyl) push the value more negative.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Since **CCc1ccc(CC)cc1** has two ethyl groups (moderately sized alkyl chains), its property value should be slightly positive but lower than molecules with polar or functionalized groups.
   - A reasonable estimate is close to **0.1**, similar to **CCc1ccccn1** (ethylpyridine, **0.08629489**) but adjusted for the lack of nitrogen.

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -2.6273766140341
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains an **aniline (Nc1ccccc1)** core, which is a benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2). This is similar to some of the provided examples (e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` with a property of `-0.6276611`).
2. **Sulfonamide Group**: The substituent is **S(N)(=O)=O**, a sulfonamide group. This is a polar and electron-withdrawing group, similar in nature to nitro groups (`N(=O)=O`) but likely less strongly electron-withdrawing than nitro groups.
3. **Electron-Withdrawing Effects**: The sulfonamide group will decrease electron density on the ring, similar to nitro groups but to a lesser extent. This is evidenced by the fact that nitroaniline (`Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`) has a property value of `-0.6276611`, while simpler aniline derivatives (without strong electron-withdrawing groups) tend to have more positive values (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1` has `0.33080702`).

### Comparison to Examples:
- The closest analog is `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` with a value of `-0.6276611`. The sulfonamide group is less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group, so we would expect the property value to be slightly higher (less negative) than `-0.6276611`.
- Another relevant example is `Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12` (a purine derivative) with a value of `-0.53938756`. This suggests that nitrogen-rich heterocycles with moderate polarity can have values in this range.
- The presence of the sulfonamide group (instead of nitro) likely places the value closer to `-0.5` to `-0.6`.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate for **Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O** would be slightly higher (less negative) than `-0.6276611` (the nitroaniline value). 

**Predicted property value: `-0.55`** (rounded to two decimal places for simplicity). 

This accounts for the sulfonamide being less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group while still being polar and reducing the property value compared to plain aniline.

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: -1.6694453913290008
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34**, let's analyze its structure and compare it to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structure Analysis:
The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings, forming a **tetracene-like structure** (though not linear; it's more complex). The structure can be broken down as:
- A central naphthalene-like core (two fused rings) with additional fused rings extending out.

### Key Observations from Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings (e.g., benzene, naphthalene) tend to have small positive or negative values (e.g., `C1CCCC1` = 0.623, `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` = -0.205).
   - Larger fused systems (e.g., `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54`) have values close to zero (`-9.53e-06`), suggesting minimal impact from extended conjugation in this property.

2. **Substituents**: 
   - Halogens (Cl, Br) or polar groups (e.g., NO2, OH) often shift the property significantly (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` = 0.096, `c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1` = 0.852).
   - The given molecule has no substituents, so the property will depend purely on the fused ring system.

3. **Similar Molecules**:
   - `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` (3 fused rings + substituent) = -0.205.
   - `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` (5 fused rings) ≈ 0.0.
   - `Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32` (3 fused rings + substituent) = -2.584 (outlier, likely due to sterics/substituent).

### Prediction:
The molecule **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34** has 4 fused rings and no substituents. Based on the examples:
- Larger fused systems without polar/halogen substituents tend to have values **close to zero**.
- The most similar example is `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54` (5 rings, ≈ 0.0), so this molecule (4 rings) should also be near zero but slightly more positive due to fewer rings (less conjugation).

### Final Prediction:
**Predicted property value: `0.12`**  
(Rationale: Slightly positive due to intermediate size, similar to smaller fused systems like `C1CCCC1` = 0.623 but less extreme.)

Iteration: 55
SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 0.5530869305190294
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group contributions. The molecule in question is:

**Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**

This structure contains multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH), an aromatic system, and a carbonyl group (C=O), which are polar and can form hydrogen bonds. The molecule is relatively large and has significant polarity due to the high number of oxygen-containing functional groups. 

Looking at similar molecules in the examples:
- Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`) tend to have very negative values (-4.81897433), but this is an extreme case due to its small size and high density of -OH groups.
- Aromatic systems with hydroxyl groups (e.g., `Oc1cccc(O)c1`) have modest positive values (0.03241073).
- Larger fused aromatic systems with polar groups (e.g., `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl`) have higher positive values (1.00774449).

The molecule here is a flavonoid-like structure with three aromatic rings, four hydroxyl groups, and a carbonyl group. Given its size and polarity, it is likely to have a **positive property value in the range of 0.8 to 1.2**. 

A reasonable prediction, considering the examples, would be:  
**Predicted property value: 0.95**  

This aligns with the trend where larger, polar, multi-ring systems with hydrogen-bonding groups tend to have moderately high positive values.

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: -5.571221455246654
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphate group (P=O)**: Present in molecules like:
   - `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (property: 0.918)
   - `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (property: 1.288)
   - `CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C` (property: 1.194)
   Phosphates/thioates with additional polar groups tend to have properties in the **0.9–1.3 range**.

2. **Amide (NC(C)=O)**: Present in:
   - `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (property: -0.212)
   - `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (property: -2.314)
   Amides can lower the property, but the effect depends on context.

3. **Thiolate (SC)**: Thiol/sulfur-containing groups appear in:
   - `Sc1nccc(=O)[nH]1` (property: -0.354)
   - `c2ccc1scnc1c2` (property: -0.541)
   Sulfur groups often reduce the property slightly.

4. **Methoxy (CO)**: Present in many molecules, e.g., `COc1ccc(C=CC)cc1` (property: -0.976), but its effect is mixed.

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
The closest analog is likely **COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** (property: 1.288), but our molecule replaces one alkoxy group with an amide and another with a thiolate. The amide and thiolate are less polar than the chloroaromatic groups, so we expect a **lower property** than 1.288 but still positive due to the phosphate.

### Predicted Property:
Given the balance of the phosphate (increasing) and the amide/thiolate (decreasing), a reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property: 0.75**  

This aligns with the trend of phosphate-containing molecules (~0.9–1.3) but accounts for the moderating effects of the amide and thiolate.  

### Final Answer:
**0.75**
==================================================
Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.25734059185058733
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Cl\C=C/Cl** (1,2-dichloroethene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values. 

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Halogenated Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl) has a high value of **1.2507042**.
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (dichlorophenol) has a low value of **-1.74509905**.
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (chloroaniline) has a value of **-0.3396183**.
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane) has a value of **0.05355909**.
   - **CCCCBr** (1-bromobutane) has a value of **-0.5943925**.

   Halogenation alone does not consistently lead to high or low values; the context (e.g., aromaticity, functional groups) matters.

2. **Alkenes**:
   - **CCCC(=C)C** (2-methyl-2-pentene) has a value of **0.44458867**, similar to **CC1CCCC1** (methylcyclopentane, **0.44458867**).
   - **CCC=O** (butyraldehyde) has a higher value of **0.76070471**, but this includes a carbonyl group.

3. **Simple Chlorinated Alkenes**:
   - No direct examples of chlorinated alkenes are provided, but **Cl\C=C/Cl** is a small, symmetrical molecule with two chlorines on a double bond. 

### Prediction Approach:
- The molecule is small and non-aromatic, with no additional functional groups (like carbonyls or hydroxyls) that could significantly alter the property.
- The presence of two chlorines might slightly increase the property value compared to non-halogenated alkenes, but not as much as in highly halogenated aromatic systems.
- Comparing to **CCBr (0.05355909)** and **CCCCBr (-0.5943925)**, the property seems to decrease with size for halogenated aliphatics, but **Cl\C=C/Cl** is smaller and more symmetrical.

Given these observations, I predict the property for **Cl\C=C/Cl** to be in the range of **0.1 to 0.3**, closer to the lower end due to its simplicity and lack of aromaticity or complex functional groups. 

### Final Prediction:
**0.15** (specific value based on interpolation of similar examples).
==================================================
Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 0.5120351692270471
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: 
   - Simple aromatic rings with heteroatoms or substituents tend to have property values in the range of **-1.0 to +1.0**.
   - For example:
     - **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline): **0.08629489**
     - **Oc1cccc(Cl)c1** (chlorophenol): **-0.36400638**
     - **c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43** (polycyclic aromatic): **-9.53e-06**

2. **Heteroaromatics**:
   - Nitrogen-containing heteroaromatics (e.g., pyridine-like structures) often have moderately negative values unless polar substituents are present.
   - Example:
     - **COc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (methoxy-substituted purine): **-1.68666634**
     - **Cc1ncnc2nccnc12** (methyl-substituted purine): **-0.89762103**

3. **Pyridine (c1ccncc1)**:
   - Pyridine is a simple 6-membered heteroaromatic ring with one nitrogen. It lacks substituents, so its property value should be less polar than substituted analogs but more polar than pure hydrocarbons.
   - Comparing to similar structures:
     - **CNc1ccccc1** (N-methylaniline, aromatic + N): **0.08629489**
     - **CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1** (complex N-containing aromatic): **0.43570011**
     - **c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23** (N-containing polycyclic): **-4.85718069**

   - Pyridine is less polar than aniline derivatives but more polar than polycyclic N-heteroaromatics. A reasonable estimate would be slightly negative.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the trends, the property value for **c1ccncc1 (pyridine)** is likely in the range of **-0.5 to -0.1**. A plausible estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -0.25**  

This balances the slight polarity introduced by the nitrogen against the lack of substituents or extended conjugation.

Iteration: 59
SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 1.337131497180896
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, hydrogen bonding capability, and the presence of certain functional groups (e.g., nitro groups, halogens, aromatic systems, and hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors). The property values tend to become more negative with increasing hydrogen-bonding capacity (e.g., polyols like `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` at **-8.81456796**) or aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., `Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O` at **-9.45768596**). Conversely, simpler, nonpolar, or weakly polar molecules (e.g., `CCC` at **0.9037335** or `CC#C` at **0.94228824**) have positive or near-zero values.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
**OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**  
This molecule has:
1. **Hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors**: Multiple -OH groups (strong H-bond donors/acceptors), an ester (`OC(=O)`), and an amine (`Nc2ccnc3`).
2. **Aromatic systems**: Two fused aromatic rings with a chlorine substituent (electron-withdrawing).
3. **Polarity**: High due to the ester, hydroxyls, and amine.
4. **Molecular size/complexity**: Moderately large with fused rings and flexible chains.

### Comparison to Examples:
- The polyol `OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO` has a very negative value (**-8.81456796**) due to extensive H-bonding. Here, there are fewer -OH groups but additional polar features (ester, amine).
- Aromatic systems with polar substituents (e.g., `Cc1ccc(NC(=O)N(C)C)cc1` at **-1.4255744**) or fused rings (e.g., `c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3` at **-4.2881504**) show negative values.
- The presence of chlorine (e.g., `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` at **-0.29424802**) slightly reduces the value.

### Prediction:
Given the combination of H-bonding (-OH, amine), aromaticity, and polar groups (ester, Cl), the value should be **more negative than -1.5 but less extreme than polyols or nitro-aromatics**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: -2.75**  

This balances the contributions from the hydroxyls, ester, and fused aromatic system with chlorine.
==================================================
Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 0.3889278361632943
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular structure with the property values. Here's my reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains**: 
   - **CCCc1ccccc1** (propylbenzene): -0.16965113  
   - **CCCCCCCI** (1-iodohexane): -0.62531882  
   - **C1CCC2CCCCC2C1** (decalin): -0.63156529  
   - **CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1** (tert-butylbenzene): -0.97809526  
   - **CCCC(=O)CCCC** (2-nonanone): -0.75928689  
   - **CCC(C)Cl** (2-chlorobutane): 0.32442156  

   Hydrocarbon chains with no polar groups tend to have negative values, while halogen substitution can shift the value positively or negatively depending on the context.

2. **Oxygen-Containing Functional Groups**:
   - **CCOC=O** (ethyl formate): 0.57578709  
   - **COC=O** (methyl formate): 0.73924539  
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol): -0.3554547  
   - **CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C**: 1.53071889  

   Oxygen-containing groups (e.g., alcohols, esters, ketones) can increase the property value, especially if they are polar or hydrogen-bonding. The presence of multiple oxygen atoms or conjugated systems further increases the value.

3. **Alcohols**:
   - **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol): -0.3554547  
   - **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (tert-amyl alcohol): -0.08598968  

   Simple alcohols tend to have moderately negative to near-zero values, with branching potentially reducing the negativity.

### Prediction for **CCCCCO** (1-pentanol):
- This is a linear primary alcohol with a 5-carbon chain. 
- Compared to **OC1CCCCCCC1** (cycloheptanol, -0.3554547), which is a cyclic alcohol, 1-pentanol is less constrained and has a slightly longer alkyl chain. 
- The linear chain may make the property slightly more negative than cyclic alcohols, but the hydroxyl group will offset this somewhat. 
- The value is likely in the range of **-0.3 to -0.5**, similar to other simple alcohols in the dataset.

### Final Prediction:
Given the trends, the predicted property value for **CCCCCO** is approximately **-0.4**. 

However, looking more closely at **OC1CCCCCCC1** (-0.3554547) and **CC(C)CC(C)(C)O** (-0.08598968), the linear structure of 1-pentanol is likely closer to the cycloheptanol case but slightly more negative due to reduced steric hindrance. 

Thus, a refined estimate is **-0.38**.

### Final Answer:
**-0.38**

Iteration: 61
SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 0.2589115737731432
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, aromaticity, functional groups, and overall molecular complexity. The molecule in question is:

**CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**

Let's break down its structural features:
1. **Aromatic ring (c2ccccc2)**: This contributes negatively to the property (as seen in many examples with aromatic rings, e.g., `Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2` has a very negative value).
2. **Sulfone group (S(=O)(=O))**: This is a polar and electron-withdrawing group, which may increase the property value (similar to phosphoryl groups in some examples).
3. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: This is polar and may contribute moderately negatively (e.g., `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1` has a negative value).
4. **Heterocyclic ring with oxygen (CCO1)**: This adds some polarity but is not as strongly negative as aromaticity.
5. **Methyl group (CC1=)**: Non-polar, likely negligible effect.

Comparing to similar molecules:
- `Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2` (highly aromatic, very negative: -4.656).
- `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (multiple amides, very negative: -4.685).
- `CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C` (complex with aromatic and polar groups: 1.129).

This molecule has a balance of aromaticity (negative contribution) and polar groups like sulfone (positive contribution). The sulfone is likely dominant here, but the aromatic ring and amide will pull the value down somewhat. 

**Predicted property value: ~0.5 to 0.8**  
A reasonable estimate would be **0.65**, given the competing effects. 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend in the examples where polar/electron-withdrawing groups increase the value and aromaticity decreases it.)

SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 1.1371515921092357
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The molecule is:

**COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)**

### Key structural features:
1. **Aromatic system with nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: From the examples, molecules with nitro groups (e.g., `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O`) tend to have negative property values (around -0.5979). However, the nitro group's effect can vary depending on conjugation and other substituents.
2. **Ester groups (C(=O)OC)**: Esters (e.g., `CCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC`) are associated with higher positive values (1.4563), but this depends on the rest of the molecule.
3. **Fused ring system with nitrogen (NC=)**: Heterocycles with nitrogen (e.g., `c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2`) can have slightly negative values (-0.1054), but again, context matters.
4. **Substituted benzene ring (c2ccccc2)**: Aromatic rings with substitutions (e.g., `Cc1ccccc1C`) often have moderately negative values (-0.5137).

### Observations:
- The molecule has both electron-withdrawing (nitro, ester) and electron-donating (methyl, nitrogen) groups, which may balance out some effects.
- The presence of two ester groups and a nitro group suggests some polarity and potential for higher values, but the aromatic system and nitrogen may moderate this.

### Comparison to similar examples:
- `CCN(CC)C(=S)SSC(=S)N(CC)CC` (0.6538): Contains sulfur and nitrogen, moderately positive.
- `CC(=O)C3(C)CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (1.0888): Complex structure with carbonyls, high positive value.
- `CN2c1nc(N(C)(CCO))ccc1NC(=O)c3cccnc23` (0.8372): Nitrogen-rich heterocycle with amide, moderately positive.

### Prediction:
Given the balance of electron-withdrawing and donating groups, the presence of esters, and the nitro group, the property value is likely **moderately positive**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.75** (approximate, based on structural similarity to examples with values in the 0.6–1.0 range). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is a generalized estimate based on the trends in the provided data.)

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -1.233508519699159
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible property value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two amide groups (**NC=O**) and a cyclopropane ring (**C1(CC1)**). It is a cyclic diamide (imide) structure, resembling a succinimide derivative but with an embedded cyclopropane ring.
2. **Polarity**: The presence of two highly polar amide groups suggests significant dipole interactions, likely increasing the property value (similar to other polar/amide-containing molecules in the dataset).
3. **Rigidity**: The cyclopropane ring adds strain and rigidity, which may influence the property (e.g., reducing conformational entropy).
4. **Comparable Examples**:
   - **CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (property = 1.1220402): This steroid-like molecule has carbonyl groups and rigidity, yielding a positive property value.
   - **ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O** (property = 1.01996761): A chlorinated diamide with aromaticity, also yielding a positive value.
   - **CC(=O)SC4CC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C5CCC2(C)C(CCC23CCC(=O)O3)C45** (property = 1.61369759): Another rigid polycyclic molecule with carbonyls, giving a high value.

### Prediction:
The molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2** is a rigid, polar diamide with no aromaticity but significant dipole moments from the amides. Given the examples above, such structures tend to have property values in the range of **0.5 to 1.5**. 

A reasonable estimate for this specific molecule would be:  
**Predicted property value: 0.95**  

This aligns with the trend observed for other polar, rigid, non-aromatic carbonyl-containing molecules in the dataset.

Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 0.6893698293339288
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property value for **ClCC** (chloroethane):

1. **Simple Chlorinated Alkanes**: 
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) has a property value of **-0.01389684**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (pentachlorobenzene) has a value of **-0.97837341**, indicating that increasing chlorine substitution tends to decrease the property value.
   - **ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl** (a heavily chlorinated hydrocarbon) has a high value of **1.28055263**, but this is likely due to its complex polycyclic structure rather than just chlorine content.

2. **Simple Alkanes vs. Chlorinated Derivatives**:
   - **CCCCC** (pentane) has a value of **0.59947289**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) has a value of **-0.01389684**, suggesting that introducing a single chlorine atom reduces the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

3. **Chloroethane (ClCC)**:
   - This is a very simple chlorinated alkane with only one chlorine and two carbons. 
   - Compared to **CCCCC** (0.599) and **Clc1ccccc1** (-0.014), we'd expect **ClCC** to fall somewhere between these values, likely closer to the chlorobenzene value but slightly higher due to its simpler, non-aromatic structure.
   - The presence of a single chlorine likely reduces the property value relative to pure alkanes, but not as drastically as in heavily chlorinated or aromatic systems.

### Predicted Property Value for **ClCC**:  
**~0.2** (approximate, likely between 0.1 and 0.3).  

Given the examples, a reasonable estimate would be **0.205** (similar to **CCC(C)(C)CC**, which is a branched alkane with a value of 0.20505842, as chloroethane's simplicity and single chlorine might balance out similarly).  

However, considering the trend where chlorine reduces the value, a slightly lower estimate like **0.15** might also be plausible.  

For specificity, I'll predict:

*Note*: Without knowing the exact property (e.g., logP, solubility, etc.), this is an empirical estimate based on the given data trends. The true value could vary slightly depending on the property's dependence on molecular features.

SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: -0.4865821799853676
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (n1)** substituted with a **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (trichloromethyl)** group and a **chlorine (Cl)** on the aromatic ring. 
   - Pyridine is a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring, which can influence polarity and electronic properties.
   - The **trichloromethyl group** is highly electron-withdrawing and bulky, which can significantly affect the property.

2. **Chlorine Substituents**: 
   - The presence of multiple chlorines (one on the ring and three on the methyl group) suggests significant hydrophobicity and electron-withdrawing effects.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (property: 0.09613839): This is a dichlorinated biphenyl, which is less polar and less electron-withdrawing than our target molecule. The property is slightly positive.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (property: 1.20198495): This has a trichloromethyl group attached to a biphenyl system, similar to our target but with an extra phenyl ring. The property is more positive (~1.20), likely due to the trichloromethyl group.
   - **ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O** (property: 1.15919097): This also has a **C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** group and other polar features, yielding a property >1.
   - **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl** (property: 0.63950298): This is a heavily chlorinated nitrobenzene, with a moderately positive property.

### Inference:
The target molecule has:
- A pyridine ring (more polar than benzene).
- A trichloromethyl group (strong electron-withdrawing effect, similar to the examples above with property >1).
- One additional chlorine on the ring (adds to hydrophobicity/electron-withdrawing).

Given the examples, the trichloromethyl group tends to push the property into the **positive range (0.5–1.5)**, especially when combined with other halogens. The pyridine nitrogen may slightly reduce the value compared to pure benzene systems (due to its lone pair).

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate is **~0.85**, balancing the effects of the trichloromethyl group and the pyridine ring.

**Final Answer: 0.85**

Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: 0.17242200828566182
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O** (which is 2-hexanol), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alcohols (R-OH)**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (3-heptanol): Property value = **-0.08598968**
   - **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (1-phenylethanol): Property value = **-0.21300292**
   - **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol): Property value = **0.17242201**
   - **CCC(CC)CO** (2-ethyl-1-butanol): Property value = **0.17242201** (same as above, likely due to similar branching and chain length).

   Alcohols generally have property values in the range of **-0.2 to +0.2**, with branching tending to slightly increase the value.

2. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Longer aliphatic chains or aromatic rings tend to increase the property value if polar or functional groups are present (e.g., **CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC** has a high value of **1.45627875** due to ester groups).
   - Simple branched alcohols like **CCC(C)CCO** and **CCC(CC)CO** have the same value (**0.17242201**), suggesting branching at the second carbon doesn't significantly alter the property.

3. **Position of the OH Group**:
   - **CCCC(O)CCC** (OH at position 3) has a slightly negative value (**-0.08598968**), while **CCC(C)CCO** (OH at position 1) has a positive value (**0.17242201**). This suggests terminal OH groups may lead to higher values than internal OH groups.

### Analysis of **CCCCC(C)O**:
- This is **2-hexanol**, a branched alcohol with the OH group at the second carbon.
- Structurally, it is similar to **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol) but with the OH group moved to the second carbon instead of the first.
- Based on the trend, moving the OH group from terminal (position 1) to internal (position 2) would likely decrease the property value slightly.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- **CCC(C)CCO** (terminal OH) = **0.17242201**
- **CCCC(O)CCC** (internal OH) = **-0.08598968**

For **CCCCC(C)O** (OH at position 2), the value should be between these two, closer to the terminal OH case but slightly lower. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.05**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data. If the property is something like logP or solubility, the reasoning would align with these trends.) 

However, looking more closely, **CCC(C)CCO** and **CCC(CC)CO** are structurally very similar to **CCCCC(C)O** (all are 6-carbon alcohols with branching near the OH), and their values are **0.17242201**. Thus, the most consistent prediction is:

**Final predicted property value: 0.17242201** (same as the closely related examples). 

But since **CCCCC(C)O** has the OH at position 2 (like **CCCC(O)CCC**), it might be slightly lower than **0.17242201**. A compromise would be:

**Adjusted prediction: 0.10**  

Given the examples, the safest answer is to match the most similar case, which is **0.17242201**. 

Thus, the predicted property value for **CCCCC(C)O** is:  
**0.17242201**

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.35617632512176467
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1,4-dibromobenzene), I will analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations:
1. **Halogenated Aromatic Compounds**: 
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (1,4-dichlorobenzene) has a property value of **-0.719754**.
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (a more complex dichlorinated biphenyl) has a value of **-0.719754** (same as 1,4-dichlorobenzene, suggesting symmetry matters).
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene) has a value of **-0.259401** (less negative than dichlorinated).
   - **Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (dichlorophenol) has a value of **-1.74509905**, indicating hydroxyl groups further decrease the property.

2. **Bromine vs. Chlorine**:
   - Halogens (Cl, Br) generally contribute to negative property values, but bromine is larger and more polarizable than chlorine. This may lead to slightly different effects, but no brominated examples are provided for direct comparison.

3. **Symmetry and Substitution**:
   - Symmetrical dihalogenated aromatics (e.g., 1,4-dichlorobenzene) tend to have more negative values than monosubstituted or asymmetrical ones.
   - The property becomes more negative with additional halogens or functional groups (e.g., hydroxyl or nitro groups).

4. **Brominated Aromatic Estimate**:
   - Since 1,4-dichlorobenzene has a value of **-0.719754**, and bromine is somewhat similar but more polarizable, the value for 1,4-dibromobenzene might be slightly less negative (closer to zero) due to weaker electronegativity but larger size. However, without bromine examples, this is speculative.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity between chlorine and bromine in aromatic systems and the trend for symmetrical dihalogenated benzenes, the property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is likely close to that of 1,4-dichlorobenzene but adjusted slightly for bromine's properties. 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.65** (slightly less negative than 1,4-dichlorobenzene due to bromine's lower electronegativity but larger polarizability).

### Note:
Without explicit examples of brominated aromatics in the training data, this prediction is an educated approximation based on chemical intuition and trends from chlorinated analogs. For higher accuracy, more data or a model would be needed. 

**Final predicted property value: -0.65**

Iteration: 68
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 1.2507041958905474
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in the property values based on molecular structure. The property seems to be influenced by factors such as halogen substitution (Cl, Br), aromaticity, functional groups, and molecular size/complexity. 

Let's analyze the given molecule:  
**Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**  

This is a highly chlorinated biphenyl-like structure (similar to polychlorinated biphenyls, PCBs). It has:
- Two aromatic rings with heavy chlorine substitution (6 chlorine atoms in total).  
- Symmetrical structure with chlorine atoms at multiple positions.  

From the examples, we see that heavily chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values when the substitution is very high (e.g., **Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a value of **2.01540966**). However, the given molecule has fewer chlorines (6 vs. 10 in the example above), so the value should be lower but still positive.  

Another similar example is **ClC(Br)Br** with a value of **-1.3198026**, but this is a much smaller and less aromatic molecule. The aromaticity and symmetry of the given molecule suggest a higher value.  

Given these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl** is:  

**Predicted property value: ~1.25**  

This is based on interpolation between the highly chlorinated example (2.015) and less chlorinated/smaller structures, accounting for the symmetrical aromatic system.

Iteration: 69
SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 1.3056105311521413
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided. The property seems to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, functional groups, and aromaticity. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Structural Features of the Molecule:
1. **Aromatic Systems**: The molecule contains three aromatic rings (two substituted phenyl rings and one substituted benzene ring), which are connected via a phosphate group (OP(=O)(O...)...). Aromatic rings generally contribute positively to the property when substituted with polar groups (e.g., phosphate, ethers).
2. **Phosphate Group (OP(=O)(O...)O...)**: This is a highly polar and bulky group, which likely increases the property value significantly. Similar phosphate-containing molecules in the examples (e.g., CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O with property 1.477) suggest phosphate groups contribute to higher values.
3. **Ether Linkages (Oc2cccc(C)c2 and Oc3ccccc3C)**: These are polar and may further increase the property.
4. **Methyl Substituents (Cc1... and Cc2...)**: Non-polar alkyl groups may slightly reduce the property, but their effect is minor compared to the polar groups.
5. **Overall Size and Complexity**: The molecule is large and has multiple aromatic systems linked by polar groups, which typically correlates with higher property values in the examples.

### Comparison with Similar Examples:
- **Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1**: Property = 0.986. This has polar amide and aromatic groups but lacks phosphate. Our molecule has more polar features.
- **COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl**: Property = 1.132. This has polar ether and trichloromethyl groups, but our molecule has a phosphate group, which is more polar.
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O**: Property = 1.477. This has a thiophosphate and amide, similar in polarity to our molecule's phosphate.

### Prediction:
Given the presence of the phosphate group and multiple aromatic systems, the property value is likely higher than most examples but not as extreme as some outliers (e.g., CCOC(=O)C=Cc1ccccc1 with -3.325). A reasonable estimate is between **1.2 and 1.5**.

### Final Predicted Value:
**1.35** (specific value chosen based on balancing the contributions of the phosphate group and aromatic systems). 

This aligns with the trend where phosphate-containing and highly polar aromatic molecules tend to have property values in this range.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.8244517303561575
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**, I will analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)**: The presence of **CF3** (electron-withdrawing) is seen in some molecules in the dataset. For example:
   - **CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C** has a **CF3** group and a property value of **0.80557537**.
   - **ClCC#N** (with a polar group) has a value of **0.55808273**.

2. **Aromatic ring with substitution**: The molecule has a benzene ring substituted with **CF3** and a heterocyclic group. Similar structures:
   - **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** has a value of **-1.40881767** (but with a nitro group, which is more electron-withdrawing than CF3).
   - **Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** has a value of **-0.59790281**.

3. **Heterocyclic ketone (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O)**: This is a complex, polar, and likely rigid group. Similar polar/heterocyclic structures:
   - **NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl** has a value of **0.66767481**.
   - **O=C1N(COC(=O)CCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** has a value of **1.18557358**.

4. **Chlorine atoms**: The presence of two chlorines (electron-withdrawing but less than nitro or CF3) may increase polarity. Compare:
   - **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** has a value of **0.90366531**.
   - **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** has a value of **1.48651445**.

### Synthesis of Trends:
- The **CF3** group is strongly electron-withdrawing but not as extreme as a nitro group.
- The heterocyclic ketone with chlorines adds significant polarity and rigidity.
- Aromatic systems with moderate polar substituents tend to have values between **0.5 and 1.5** in the dataset.

### Prediction:
Given the balance of **CF3** (moderately negative contribution) and the polar heterocyclic ketone (positive contribution), the property value is likely in the **0.6 to 1.0** range. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.75** (specific guess: **0.753219**). 

This aligns with similar molecules in the dataset that combine polar/heterocyclic features with moderately electron-withdrawing groups.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.187009214980546
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate structural features with the property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitro Group (-NO₂)**: 
   - The presence of a nitro group often leads to negative property values (electron-withdrawing effect). For example:
     - `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (dinitrobenzene) has a value of **-2.16209103**.
     - `ClC(Cl)(Cl)N(=O)=O` (trichloronitromethane) has a value of **-1.84503112**.
   - Nitro groups are strongly electron-withdrawing, which likely contributes to lower (more negative) property values.

2. **Methoxy Group (-OCH₃)**:
   - Methoxy groups are electron-donating but not as strongly as nitro groups are electron-withdrawing. For example:
     - `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC` (dimethyl phthalate) has a value of **-2.35294973**, but this is likely due to the ester groups rather than the methoxy alone.
     - `COc2ccc1ncccc1c2` (methoxy-substituted heterocycle) has a value of **-0.86115747**.

3. **Aromatic Rings**:
   - Simple aromatic rings with neutral substituents (e.g., `c1ccccc1O`, phenol) have values around **0.30112966**.
   - When combined with nitro groups, the property tends to decrease (become more negative).

4. **Combined Substituents**:
   - The molecule `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has both a methoxy (electron-donating) and a nitro (electron-withdrawing) group on the same benzene ring. The nitro group's effect is likely dominant, but the methoxy may slightly offset the negativity.

### Comparison with Similar Molecules:
- `O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (dinitrobenzene): **-2.16209103** (two nitro groups, very negative).
- `c1ccccc1N(=O)=O` (nitrobenzene): Not in the dataset, but likely less negative than dinitrobenzene (probably around **-1.0 to -1.5**).
- `COc1ccccc1` (anisole): Not in the dataset, but likely slightly positive or neutral (methoxy is weakly donating).
- `COc2ccc1ncccc1c2`: **-0.86115747** (methoxy + heterocycle, no nitro).

Given that `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has one nitro and one methoxy, the nitro group will dominate, but the methoxy will reduce the negativity slightly compared to nitrobenzene. 

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate is between **-1.0 and -1.5**. Given the examples, I would predict:

**Predicted property value: -1.25** (approximate, based on trends). 

If forced to pick a specific value from the observed range, I would lean toward **-1.10380207** (similar in magnitude to some of the other nitro-containing compounds but adjusted for the methoxy group). However, since this is not exact, a more precise estimate would require additional data or a model. 

For this exercise, the predicted value is:  
**-1.25** (or approximately **-1.10380207** if aligning with the scale of similar molecules). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on correlating structural features with the given numerical trends.)

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 1.5743038871194412
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to infer a reasonable estimate.

### Key Observations:
1. **Highly Chlorinated Structure**: The molecule contains **8 chlorine atoms**, making it heavily halogenated. This is similar to **ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl** (hexachlorocyclohexane), which has a property value of **0.58518588**. 
   - The given molecule is even more chlorinated (8 Cl vs. 6 Cl), which may increase the property value further due to increased lipophilicity or steric effects.

2. **Polycyclic Framework**: The molecule has a complex polycyclic structure (likely a cage-like or adamantane-derived framework). 
   - Polycyclic structures in the examples (e.g., **CC(=O)C3(C)CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**) tend to have positive property values (e.g., **1.08876356**), but chlorination complicates this.

3. **Comparison to Other Halogenated Examples**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane): **0.22526068**
   - **Clc1ccccc1** (chlorobenzene): **-0.01389684**
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene): **-1.38308213**
   - **BrC(Br)Br** (bromoform): **0.0078757**
   - The property tends to increase with more halogens but depends on the molecular framework.

4. **Steric and Electronic Effects**: The dense chlorine substitution likely dominates the property, overshadowing other structural features. The cage-like structure may also contribute to a higher value due to rigidity.

### Prediction:
Given the extreme chlorination and polycyclic nature, the property value should be **higher than hexachlorocyclohexane (0.58518588)** but not excessively so (since additional Cl atoms may not linearly increase the property). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: 0.75 ± 0.10**

### Final Answer:

==================================================
Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.3895547479458299
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCOC=O** (propyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate molecular features with the property values. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Functional Groups and Property Trends**:
   - **Ethers (e.g., COC)**: Tend to have moderate negative values (e.g., `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)...` has 2.349, but this is a complex molecule; simpler ethers like `CCOC(=O)...` have values around -1.908 to 0.708).
   - **Esters (e.g., COC=O)**: Similar to ethers but with additional polarity due to the carbonyl group. Examples:
     - `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1`: -1.908
     - `CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2`: 0.708
   - **Small polar molecules (e.g., CC#N)**: Can have positive values (e.g., `CC#N`: 0.932).
   - **Hydrocarbon chains**: Non-polar chains (e.g., `C1CCCCCC1`) have small positive values (~0.237), while longer/branched chains may decrease the value.

2. **CCCOC=O Features**:
   - Propyl group (`CCC`): Neutral/slightly positive contribution (similar to `C1CCCCCC1`).
   - Ether linkage (`O`): Moderate influence, likely negative.
   - Carbonyl (`C=O`): Polar, may reduce the property value further (similar to esters).

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - `CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1`: -1.908 (ester + aromatic + amine).
   - `CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2`: 0.708 (ester + ether + aromatic).
   - `CCCOC=O` lacks aromaticity or additional polar groups, so its value should be between these examples but closer to simpler ethers/esters.

4. **Estimated Value**:
   - Simpler esters like `CCOC(=O)...` average around -0.5 to -1.0.
   - Propyl (`CCC`) is less polar than ethyl (`CCO`), so the value might be slightly less negative than `CCOC=O` analogs.

### Predicted Property Value for **CCCOC=O**:
Given the above reasoning, a reasonable estimate is:  
**-0.75** (with an expected range of -0.5 to -1.0 based on similar molecules).  

This aligns with the trend of simple esters having moderately negative values, while the lack of additional polar/aromatic groups prevents it from being as extreme as some other examples.

Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -1.8042928637679125
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**, let's analyze the given examples and identify trends that correlate molecular features with the property values. 

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrophobicity/Chain Length**: 
   - Longer aliphatic chains (e.g., **CCCCCCc1ccccc1**, property = -1.695) tend to have negative values, but not always (e.g., **CC**, property = 1.033). 
   - The presence of aromatic rings often reduces the property value (e.g., **c1ccc2ccccc2c1**, property = -0.757).  
   - Ethers (e.g., **CCOc1ccccc1**, property = -0.213) and esters (e.g., **COCC(=O)N...**, property = 0.435) can increase the value.

2. **Polar Functional Groups**:
   - Carboxylic acid derivatives (esters, amides) often have higher values (e.g., **COCC(=O)N...**, property = 0.435).  
   - Alcohols (**Oc1ccc(O)cc1**, property = 0.032) and halogens (**Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, property = -3.072) vary widely.

3. **Specific Cases**:
   - **CC(=O)C3CCC4...** (property = 0.868): A complex steroid-like structure with ketones and rings.  
   - **CCCC=C(CC)C=O** (property = -0.306): An aliphatic aldehyde with a double bond.  
   - **CCCOC** (property = 0.575): A simple ether with a short chain.

### Analysis of **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
- This is a **long aliphatic chain (10 carbons)** with an **ester group (CC(=O)OCC)**.  
- The ester group is polar and likely increases the property value (similar to other esters in the examples).  
- The long hydrophobic chain may partially offset this, but the ester dominates.  

### Comparison to Similar Molecules:
- **COCC(=O)N...** (ester + aromatic, property = 0.435).  
- **CCCOC** (ether, property = 0.575).  
- **CC(=O)C3CCC4...** (ketone + rings, property = 0.868).  

Given the ester group and long chain, the value should be **positive but not extremely high**, likely between **0.4 and 0.7**.  

### Predicted Property Value:
**0.55** (estimated based on ester dominance and chain length).  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an educated guess based on the trends in the data.)

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phenol-like core (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)**: 
   - Similar to **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = -0.77086304), but with additional substitutions.
2. **Amide linkage (C(=O)N)**: 
   - Seen in **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (property = 0.58417626), which also has a phenol and chloro substituents.
3. **Nitro group (N(=O)=O)**: 
   - Present in **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** (property = -1.40881767), but this is a simpler molecule.
4. **Chloro substituents (Cl)**: 
   - Chloro groups appear in many examples, often reducing the property value (e.g., **COc1ccc(Cl)cc1** = -0.77086304).
5. **Extended conjugation**: 
   - The molecule has significant conjugation, which may increase the property value slightly (e.g., **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)c1ccccc1** = -0.45061402).

### Key Observations:
- The amide linkage and nitro group introduce polar and electron-withdrawing effects, which may increase the property value compared to simple chloro-phenols.
- The molecule is more complex than **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (0.58417626), but the nitro group could offset this slightly.
- The presence of two chloro groups and a nitro group suggests a value between **0.5 and 0.7**, leaning toward the higher end due to the nitro group's strong effect.

### Predicted Property:
Given the structural similarities and trends in the examples, a reasonable prediction for **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O** is:

**0.65** (approximate, based on interpolation of similar structures). 

This is slightly higher than **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2** (0.58417626) due to the additional nitro group's contribution.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 1.871913280808419
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**, let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Groups (P(=S)(OC))**: The molecule contains two **P(=S)(OC)** groups, which are polar and moderately electron-withdrawing. Similar groups appear in some of the provided examples (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1**, property = **1.30194827**), where the presence of **P(=S)(OC)** correlates with positive property values (~1.3).

2. **Aromatic Rings and Thioether Linkage (Sc1ccc...cc1)**: The molecule has two benzene rings linked by a sulfur atom (thioether bridge). Aromatic systems with substitutions (e.g., Cl, S, or other heteroatoms) often influence the property. For example:
   - **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (property = **1.2507042**) has multiple Cl substitutions and a positive value.
   - **CCSSCC** (property = **-0.21503773**) has sulfur but no aromaticity, yielding a slightly negative value.

3. **Oxygen Linkages (Oc1ccc...)**: Ether linkages (O-aryl) are present, which are moderately polar but not as strongly electron-withdrawing as nitro or carbonyl groups. Examples like **COc1ncnc2nccnc12** (property = **-1.68666634**) show that oxygen in heterocycles can lead to negative values, but here the **P(=S)(OC)** dominates.

4. **Symmetry and Size**: The molecule is large and symmetric, similar to **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (property = **1.2507042**), which also has a high value due to its size and halogen substitutions.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- The closest analog is **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** (property = **1.30194827**), which shares the **P(=S)(OC)** group and aromatic system. The absence of Cl here is offset by the thioether bridge and additional **P(=S)(OC)** group.
- Another similar case is **Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl** (property = **1.2507042**), where multiple Cl substitutions yield a high value. Here, the **P(=S)(OC)** groups may play a similar role.

### Predicted Property:
Given the dominance of **P(=S)(OC)** groups, aromaticity, and structural similarity to molecules with property values around **1.2–1.3**, the predicted property for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1** is:

**1.28** (approximate, likely in the range 1.25–1.35). 

This aligns with the trend that large, polar, and symmetrically substituted molecules with **P(=S)(OC)** groups tend to have positive property values in this dataset.

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6579714208675438
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities that can guide the prediction.

### Key Observations:
1. **Nitrophenol-like structures**: The molecule is a nitrophenol derivative (phenol with a nitro group). In the examples, similar structures include:
   - **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (property: **0.49962833**): This is a more complex nitrophenol derivative with chlorine substitutions.
   - **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (property: **-0.59790281**): This is toluene with a nitro group (not phenol, but similar nitro-aromatic).
   - **NC(=O)c1ccccc1O** (property: **-0.59790281**): This is a phenol with an amide group (not nitro, but similar substitution pattern).

2. **Phenol vs. Nitro Group Influence**:
   - Phenol (OH group) tends to decrease the property value (more negative) compared to non-phenolic aromatics.
   - Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to decrease the property value, especially when combined with electron-withdrawing effects.

3. **Direct Comparison**:
   - The molecule **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is simpler than **Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2** (property: **0.49962833**), but the latter has additional chlorine substitutions that may increase the property value.
   - The nitro group alone (as in **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**) gives **-0.59790281**, and adding an OH group (phenol) would likely further decrease the value due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding.

### Prediction:
Given the combined effects of the phenol (OH) and nitro (N(=O)=O) groups, the property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is expected to be **negative** and similar to other nitro-aromatics but slightly more negative due to the phenol group. 

A reasonable estimate is between **-0.5 and -1.0**. From the examples, the closest match is **-0.59790281** (for **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**), but the OH group here may push it slightly lower. 

### Final Predicted Value:
**-0.65** (approximate interpolation based on the given data). 

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on the trends in the provided examples.)

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 2.039610971498222
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional group composition. The molecule in question is a highly branched oligosaccharide with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) and ether linkages (O-), which contribute to significant hydrogen bonding and polarity.

Key observations from the examples:
1. Molecules with many polar groups (e.g., hydroxyls, carbonyls) tend to have lower or negative property values (e.g., `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` has -4.685657, `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` has -1.05467949).
2. Large, non-polar hydrocarbons (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`) have higher positive values (1.29369491).
3. Halogenated aromatic compounds (e.g., `Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`) have intermediate values (~0.96).

The molecule `OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O` is a highly polar, polyhydroxylated structure with extensive hydrogen bonding capacity, similar to sugars or polyols in the examples (e.g., `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` with -1.05467949). However, it is larger and more branched, which could further reduce the property value due to increased solvation effects or steric hindrance.

**Predicted property value: ~-1.5 to -2.0**  
Given the trends, a reasonable estimate would be **-1.8**. This accounts for its extreme polarity and size, placing it between the simpler polyol (`-1.05`) and highly polar, constrained structures (e.g., `-4.68`). 

(Note: Without explicit disclosure of the property’s identity—e.g., logP, solubility, etc.—this is an empirical extrapolation from the given data.)

Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.8030783241448777
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, conjugation, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule **CCC#C** (1-butyne) and compare it to the examples to predict its property value.

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkynes**: The only alkyne in the examples is **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (a diyne with aromatic rings), which has a property value of **-0.35344316**. This suggests that triple bonds (alkynes) may contribute moderately negative values unless offset by other features.
2. **Hydrocarbons**: Simple hydrocarbons like **CCCC(O)CCC** (-0.08598968) and **Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1** (-0.16965113) have small negative values. Longer alkanes like **CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO** (-0.55660662) have more negative values, likely due to increased hydrophobicity.
3. **Polarity/Functional Groups**: Polar or electronegative groups (e.g., -OH, -Cl, -NO2) tend to decrease the property value, while conjugated systems or aromaticity can influence it variably.

### Analysis of **CCC#C**:
- **Structure**: 1-butyne is a linear alkyne with no polar groups or conjugation beyond the triple bond.
- **Comparison**:
  - It is simpler than **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (no aromatic rings), so its value should be less negative.
  - It is more polarizable than pure alkanes due to the triple bond, but lacks strong polar groups.
  - Similar to small hydrocarbons, but with a slight negative contribution from the alkyne.

### Predicted Property Value:
Given the above, a reasonable estimate for **CCC#C** would be slightly more negative than small alkanes but less negative than the diyne example. A plausible value is:  
**-0.20** (approximate, based on trends in the data).

### Refined Estimate:
Looking at **Cc1cncc(C)c1** (a heteroaromatic with some polarity, value = 0.08629489) and **CC#N** (not in examples, but likely similar to **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N**), the alkyne's effect is modest. Since **CCC#C** is a small, non-conjugated alkyne, its value is likely closer to small alkanes like **CCCC(O)CCC** (-0.085) but slightly more negative due to the triple bond.  

**Final Prediction: -0.15** (interpolating between small alkanes and the diyne example).  

However, the examples show that even small changes can lead to variability, so this is an educated guess. For higher precision, a model trained on such data would be needed, but this is a reasonable manual estimate.  

**Answer: -0.15** (approximate).  

(Note: Without a clear definition of the property, this is based purely on interpolation from the given examples.)  

---  
**Correction**: Upon revisiting, **N#Cc1ccccc1C#N** (-0.353) is more negative than **CCC#C** likely due to two triple bonds + aromaticity. For **CCC#C**, a value closer to small alkanes (e.g., **CCCC(O)CCC** at -0.086) but slightly more negative is plausible.  

**Updated Prediction: -0.10 to -0.20**.  
**Final Answer: -0.15**.  

(If the property is logP or similar, this aligns with 1-butyne being slightly more hydrophobic than butane but less than larger alkynes.)

Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 1.0291329266565148
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property appears to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and halogen (especially chlorine) substitution patterns. The molecule in question is:

**CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Chlorine substitution**: Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`, `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl`) tend to have higher property values (e.g., 1.2507042, -6.31841724). However, the exact positioning and number of chlorines matter (e.g., `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` has a lower value of 0.09613839).
2. **Phosphorus/sulfur groups**: The presence of `P(=S)` or similar groups (e.g., `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1`) tends to increase the property value (e.g., 1.30194827).
3. **Ether linkages (`Oc`)**: These seem to moderately influence the property, depending on the rest of the structure.

### Analysis of the target molecule:
- It has a `P(=S)` group, similar to the example with a high value (1.30194827).
- It has three chlorine atoms on the phenyl ring, similar to some high-value examples.
- It has an ethoxy (`CCO`) and a phenoxy (`Oc1cc...`) linkage, which may slightly reduce the impact compared to purely chlorinated or phosphorus-heavy structures.

### Predicted property:
Given the combination of `P(=S)` and multiple chlorines, the property value is likely high, similar to the example `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (1.30194827). However, the presence of the ethoxy group might slightly reduce this. 

**Predicted value: 1.15** (approximate, likely between 1.0 and 1.3 based on the examples). 

For a more precise prediction, a quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) model would be needed, but this is a reasonable estimate given the data. 

---
**Final answer: ~1.15** (likely in the range of 1.0 to 1.3).  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is based on the trend in the given examples.)*

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.5980219614079862
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **pyridine ring (c1nccc)** with a **carboxamidine group (C(=O)NN)** attached. 
   - The pyridine ring is aromatic and polar.
   - The **C(=O)NN** group is highly polar and capable of hydrogen bonding (donor and acceptor).

2. **Key Observations from Examples**:
   - Molecules with **polar groups (e.g., -NO2, -OH, -NH2, halogens)** tend to have negative property values (e.g., `Nc1ccccc1Cl: -0.339`, `Nc1cccc2ccccc12: -0.791`).
   - Molecules with **nonpolar aliphatic chains** tend to have positive values (e.g., `C=C: 1.050`, `CC(C)C: 0.760`).
   - The **carboxamidine group (C(=O)NN)** is similar in polarity to amides or ureas, which often correlate with negative values (e.g., `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1: -0.427`).
   - The **pyridine ring** alone (without substituents) might lean slightly negative due to nitrogen's electronegativity.

3. **Analogous Examples**:
   - `Nc1cccc2ccccc12` (polar -NH2 + aromatic system): **-0.791**  
   - `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (amide + aromatic): **-0.427**  
   - `Nc1ccccc1Cl` (polar -NH2 + halogen): **-0.339**  

   The presence of **C(=O)NN** (even more polar than -NH2 or amides) suggests a stronger negative contribution.

### Prediction:
Given the high polarity of the carboxamidine group and the pyridine ring, the property value is likely **negative** and moderately large (similar to other polar aromatic systems). 

A reasonable estimate is:  
**Predicted property value: -0.65**  

This aligns with examples like `COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1: -0.650` (polar groups + heterocycle) and `Nc1cccc2ccccc12: -0.791` (polar + aromatic). The exact value may vary, but the trend is clear. 

### Final Answer:
**-0.65** (approximate, based on structural analogy).

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 1.1941910090496655
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S))**: This is a notable functional group. In the examples, molecules with phosphorus-containing groups (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**) have property values around **0.406**. This suggests that the P(=S) group may contribute positively to the property value.
2. **Ester-like Linkage (SCC(=O)N)**: The thioester-like group (SCC=O) is somewhat similar to amide/carbamate groups in the examples (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C** with a value of **-0.085**). However, the sulfur substitution might slightly increase the value.
3. **Cyclic Amide (N1CCCCC1C)**: This is a cyclic amide (lactam-like) group. Cyclic structures with polar groups (e.g., **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2**) have values around **0.584**, suggesting a positive contribution.
4. **Alkyl Chains (CCCO and OCCC)**: These are neutral contributors unless branched or polar. In the examples, long alkyl chains (e.g., **CCCCCCCI**) have negative values, but here they are counterbalanced by polar groups.
5. **Overall Polarity and Size**: The molecule is large and has both polar (P(=S), C=O, N) and nonpolar (alkyl) regions. Large molecules with mixed polarity in the examples (e.g., **CC12CC(=O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO**) have values around **1.247**, but this molecule is less steroid-like and more flexible.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1**: Value = **0.406** (phosphorothioate + aromatic nitro group).
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2**: Value = **0.584** (amide + aromatic groups).
- **CC12CC(=O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO**: Value = **1.247** (complex polycyclic structure with polar groups).

Given the presence of the **P(=S)** group (contributing ~0.4), the **cyclic amide** (contributing ~0.5), and the **thioester-like linkage** (contributing modestly), the property value is likely in the range of **0.4 to 0.7**. 

### Predicted Value:
Considering the balance of contributions, a reasonable prediction is:  
**0.55** (specific value: **0.55000000**).  

This aligns with the observed trends for similar functional groups and molecular complexity in the examples.
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.046505045766283254
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, halogenation, and molecular size. The molecule in question is **CCCCCCCC** (octane), which is a simple linear alkane with no functional groups, no polarity, and no aromaticity.

From the examples:
- **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol) has a property value of **-0.08598968**. This molecule has a polar hydroxyl group, which likely contributes to its slightly negative value.
- **CCCC/C=C/C** (an unsaturated hydrocarbon) has a value of **0.23762029**, suggesting that unsaturation increases the property slightly compared to saturated alkanes.
- **CCCCCC1CCCC1** (a cyclic alkane) has a value of **-0.69460754**, indicating that cyclic alkanes may have lower values than linear alkanes.

Since **CCCCCCCC** is a saturated linear alkane with no functional groups, we can infer that its property value would be close to zero but slightly negative due to its lack of polar or aromatic features. 

Comparing it to similar molecules:
- **C/C1CCCCC1\C** (a cyclic alkane) has **-0.00730849**.
- **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol) has **-0.08598968**, but this has a polar group.

Given that **CCCCCCCC** is less polar than heptanol but more "boring" than cyclic alkanes, a reasonable estimate would be slightly more negative than **C/C1CCCCC1\C** but less negative than **CCCCCC1CCCC1**.

**Predicted property value for CCCCCCCC: ~ -0.1** (e.g., **-0.10000000**). 

This aligns with the trend that simple, nonpolar, saturated hydrocarbons have small negative values in this dataset.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 0.8479899338228349
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the examples provided:

### Key Structural Features:
1. **Steroid-like core**: The molecule has a multi-ring structure resembling steroids or terpenes (e.g., **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O** with property **0.55530384**).
2. **Ketone group (=O)**: Present in one of the rings (similar to many examples, e.g., **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C** with property **1.00113987**).
3. **Hydroxyl group (-OH)**: Two hydroxyl groups are present (e.g., **OCC2OC(OC1(CO)OC(CO)C(O)C1O)C(O)C(O)C2O** with property **1.10380207**).
4. **Alkyne group (C#C)**: A terminal alkyne is present, which is relatively rare in the examples but may slightly increase hydrophobicity or polarity depending on context.
5. **Ring fusion and size**: The molecule has fused 6-membered rings, similar to other steroid-like examples.

### Comparison to Similar Examples:
- **CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O**: Property = **0.55530384** (steroid core, ketone, one -OH).
- **CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C**: Property = **1.00113987** (more oxidized, two ketones, one -OH).
- **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO**: Property = **1.46844111** (highly oxidized, multiple polar groups).

### Prediction:
The given molecule has:
- A steroid-like core with **two hydroxyl groups** and **one ketone**, similar to the second example but with an additional -OH and an alkyne. 
- The alkyne may slightly increase the property value (similar to how halogens or unsaturated groups increase values in other examples).
- The presence of multiple polar groups (-OH, =O) suggests a higher property value than simpler steroids but lower than highly oxidized ones.

Given these observations, the predicted property value is likely between **0.8 and 1.2**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 1.050** (close to the middle of the range for similar structures). 

This aligns with the trend where oxidized steroid-like molecules with multiple polar groups have values >1.0.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 2.349987059081897
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. The molecule in question is highly complex with multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, alcohols, carbonyls, and cyclic structures), which suggests significant polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Here’s a breakdown of the features:
1. **Multiple oxygenated groups (ethers, alcohols, carbonyls)**: These tend to increase polarity and interaction potential, which may elevate the property value (as seen in similar complex oxygen-rich molecules in the examples).
2. **Polycyclic and fused ring systems**: These can contribute to higher values if they include polar substituents (e.g., the fused rings with oxygen in the given molecule).
3. **Comparison to similar examples**:
   - Molecules with simpler aromatic rings and halogens (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`) have negative values.
   - Oxygen-rich or highly functionalized molecules (e.g., `COP(=O)(OC)OC(Br)C(Cl)(Cl)Br`, `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21`) have positive values, often >1.0.
   - The given molecule is even more oxygenated and complex than most examples, suggesting a higher value.

**Predicted property value**: **1.85**  
*(Rationale: This aligns with the trend of highly functionalized, polar molecules in the dataset, likely falling between the highest values observed, such as 1.87 for `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1` and 2.03 for `CC(C)C(Nc1ccc(cc1Cl)C(F)(F)F)C(=O)OC(C#N)c2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2`.)*

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.36400637505025124
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1ccccc1Cl** (4-chlorophenol), we can analyze the given examples and identify trends or similarities in the structures and their corresponding property values.

### Key Observations:
1. **Phenol Derivatives**: 
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrophenol) has a property value of **-0.65797142**.
   - **Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (another entry for nitrophenol) also has the same value, confirming consistency.
   - The presence of an electron-withdrawing group (NO₂) on the phenol ring leads to a negative property value.

2. **Chlorinated Aromatics**:
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene) has a property value of **-0.29424802**.
   - **Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl** (dichlorobiphenyl) has a value of **-0.719754**.
   - Chlorine substituents on aromatic rings tend to contribute to negative property values, though the magnitude depends on the number and position of substituents.

3. **Phenol vs. Chlorophenol**:
   - Phenol itself (**Oc1ccccc1**) is not in the dataset, but its derivative with a nitro group (strong electron-withdrawing) gives **-0.65797142**.
   - Chlorine is less electron-withdrawing than NO₂ but more than alkyl groups. Thus, we expect the property value for **Oc1ccccc1Cl** to be less negative than nitrophenol but more negative than simple chlorobenzenes.

4. **Comparison with Similar Structures**:
   - **Fc1ccccc1** (fluorobenzene) has a positive value (**0.27048359**), but fluorine is highly electronegative and behaves differently from chlorine.
   - **Clc1ccccc1I** (chloroiodobenzene) has **-0.29424802**, suggesting that a single chlorine on a benzene ring with another halogen gives a modestly negative value.
   - **Oc1ccccc1Cl** combines the effects of phenol (OH) and chlorine, both of which are electron-withdrawing but not as strongly as NO₂.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- Nitrophenol: **-0.65797142** (strong electron-withdrawing NO₂).
- Chloroiodobenzene: **-0.29424802** (modest electron-withdrawing Cl + I).
- Dichlorobiphenyl: **-0.719754** (two chlorines + extended conjugation).

For **Oc1ccccc1Cl**, the OH and Cl are both electron-withdrawing but not as strongly as NO₂. The property value should be between nitrophenol and chloroiodobenzene. A reasonable estimate is slightly more negative than chloroiodobenzene but less negative than nitrophenol.

### Final Prediction:
**-0.45** (approximate, based on interpolation of the given examples). 

This is consistent with the observed trends in the data, where electron-withdrawing groups on aromatic rings lead to negative property values, and the magnitude depends on the strength and number of such groups.

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 0.10598096236312991
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - Two **chlorine atoms (Cl)** attached to an aromatic ring and an aliphatic chain.
   - **Alkyne group (C#C)** in the aliphatic chain.
   - **Ester-like linkage (OC(=O)N)**, resembling a carbamate or urethane group.
   - **Aromatic ring** with chlorine substitution (similar to some examples like `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)...`).

2. **Polarity and Electronic Effects**:
   - The presence of two Cl atoms and the polar OC(=O)N group suggests moderate to high polarity.
   - The alkyne may slightly reduce polarity compared to a fully saturated chain.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - Molecules with **two Cl atoms** (e.g., `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`) have property values around **1.2–1.5**.
   - Molecules with **polar groups like esters or amides** (e.g., `COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC`) have negative values (around **-2.35**), but this is offset here by the Cl substitutions.
   - The **OC(=O)N** group is somewhat similar to `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3`, which has a value of **1.29151105**, suggesting a positive contribution.

4. **Hybrid Features**:
   - The combination of **Cl substitutions** (positive contribution) and **polar groups** (can be negative or positive depending on context) suggests a balance.
   - The alkyne is relatively neutral in this context.

### Predicted Property:
Given the above, the molecule likely has a **positive property value**, similar to other Cl-rich or polar-but-substituted examples. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted Property Value: 0.75**  

This balances the positive contributions of the Cl atoms and the OC(=O)N group, while accounting for the alkyne's minor effect. The value is consistent with the range observed for similar structures in the examples.

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 1.0077444854550643
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule has a central carbon attached to:
   - A hydroxyl group (**OH**),
   - A chlorophenyl ring (**c1ccc(Cl)cc1**),
   - A pyrimidine-like ring (**c2cncnc2**, similar to a pyrimidine or diazine),
   - Another chlorophenyl ring (**c3ccccc3Cl**).

2. **Key Features**:
   - Two aromatic rings (both with **Cl** substitution, which is electronegative).
   - A heterocyclic **c2cncnc2** ring (likely contributing to polarity or hydrogen bonding).
   - A hydroxyl group (**OH**), which is polar and can form hydrogen bonds.
   - The presence of multiple **Cl** atoms (electron-withdrawing) and aromatic systems.

### Comparison with Examples:
- **Cl-substituted aromatics**: 
  - **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1** has a value of **-0.92971337**.
  - **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has a value of **1.20198495** (due to more Cl and bulky groups).
  - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc2Cl** has a value of **1.2507042** (highly chlorinated).
- **Heterocycles**:
  - **Nc1nc[nH]n1** has a value of **0.4456819** (similar to **c2cncnc2** here).
- **Hydroxyl + Aromatic Systems**:
  - **Oc1ccc(O)cc1** has a value of **0.03241073** (two OH groups).
  - **Oc1cccc2ncccc12** has a value of **-0.86115747** (OH + fused heterocycle).

### Property Prediction:
The molecule has:
- Two **Cl** atoms (electron-withdrawing, tends to lower the property, but multiple Cl can sometimes increase it, as seen in highly chlorinated examples).
- A polar **OH** group (can increase or decrease depending on context).
- A **c2cncnc2** ring (similar to **Nc1nc[nH]n1**, which has **0.4456819**).
- Bulky aromatic systems (could increase the property due to sterics).

Given the balance of these features, the property is likely **positive but modest**, similar to molecules like:
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (**1.20198495**), but with less Cl.
- **Nc1nc[nH]n1** (**0.4456819**), but with more aromatic bulk.

### Final Prediction:
A reasonable estimate is **~0.75**. This accounts for:
- The **OH** group (slight positive contribution).
- The **c2cncnc2** ring (similar to **0.4456819**).
- The two **Cl** atoms (moderate electron-withdrawing effect).
- The bulky aromatic systems (increases the property).

Thus, the predicted property value is:  
**0.75** (approximate, based on structural analogies).

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 0.17315895122965225
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural and functional group trends that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Simple Aliphatic Chains and Esters**:
   - **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate): Property = **-0.08509586**
   - **CCCCBr** (1-bromobutane): Property = **-0.5943925**
   - **CCCCCC=O** (hexanal): Property = **0.20577762**
   - **CCCCCCCCC(=O)C** (2-nonanone): Property = **-1.3403389**

   Esters and aldehydes/ketones with aliphatic chains tend to have property values close to zero, with esters slightly negative and aldehydes slightly positive. Ketones with longer chains (e.g., 2-nonanone) are more negative.

2. **Functional Group Influence**:
   - The **C=O** (carbonyl) group in esters (e.g., **CCCC(=O)OCC**) contributes to a slightly negative value.
   - The **C=O** in aldehydes (e.g., **CCCCCC=O**) contributes to a slightly positive value.
   - The **OC=O** (ester) group in **CCCCOC=O** is similar to **CCCC(=O)OCC**, but with a shorter chain and a formate (HCOO-) instead of a longer acyl group.

3. **Chain Length and Branching**:
   - Shorter chains (e.g., **CCCCBr**) tend to be less negative than longer ones (e.g., **CCCCCCCCC(=O)C**).
   - **CCCCOC=O** has a butyl chain (4 carbons) and a formyl group, which is simpler than ethyl butyrate.

### Prediction for **CCCCOC=O**:
- The molecule is an ester (butyl formate) with a short aliphatic chain and a formyl group. 
- Compared to **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butyrate, -0.085), **CCCCOC=O** has a smaller acyl group (formyl instead of butyryl), which may slightly increase the property value (less negative).
- However, the **C=O** in formates is less shielded than in larger esters, potentially making it slightly more positive.

Given these trends, the predicted property value for **CCCCOC=O** is likely **between 0.0 and 0.2**. A reasonable estimate is:

**Predicted property value: 0.12**
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.4340067123867674
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, we can observe trends in how certain structural features influence the property value. Let's analyze the given molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) and compare it to similar molecules in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Chlorine Substituents**: 
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of **0.22526068**.
   - **Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl** (hexachlorobenzene) has a property value of **-0.03822485**.
   - **Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1** (4-chloroaniline) has a property value of **-0.3396183**.
   - **CCC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1** (a chloro-substituted amide) has a property value of **-0.8944213**.

   Chlorine substituents tend to reduce the property value, but the effect is not extreme unless combined with other functional groups (e.g., nitro groups, which drastically reduce the value, as seen in **Cc1ccc(cc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O** with **-9.45768596**).

2. **Small Chlorinated Alkanes**:
   - **ClCCCl** (1,2-dichloroethane) has a value of **0.22526068**.
   - **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) is even simpler, with no additional carbon backbone or functional groups. 

   Since **ClCCl** is smaller and less polarizable than **ClCCCl**, we might expect its property value to be slightly lower but still in the same general range as other small chlorinated alkanes.

3. **Comparison to Other Small Molecules**:
   - **CCBr** (bromoethane) has a value of **0.05355909**, which is lower than **ClCCCl** but still positive.
   - **CNN** (methylhydrazine) has a surprisingly high value of **0.88442527**, likely due to the nitrogen lone pairs.

   Given that **ClCCl** is simpler than **ClCCCl** but similar in nature, its value should be somewhat lower but still positive.

### Prediction:
Given the above trends, **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) is expected to have a property value slightly lower than **ClCCCl** but still positive. A reasonable estimate would be around **0.15**, considering the simplicity of the molecule and the effect of the chlorines.

However, looking more closely at **ClCCCl** (0.225) and **CCBr** (0.053), **ClCCl** likely falls between these two. A more precise estimate would be **~0.12**.

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **ClCCl** is **0.12**.

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.21300292041459154
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples and the structural features of the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, I will predict its property value by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset.

### Key Observations:
1. **Structural Features**:
   - The molecule is a **methyl-substituted phenol** (cresol derivative) with a methyl group at the 2-position (ortho to the hydroxyl group) and another methyl group likely at the 4- or 5-position (meta or para to the hydroxyl).
   - Phenol derivatives in the dataset tend to have negative property values when unsubstituted or with simple substituents (e.g., **Oc1cccc(O)c1** has a value of **0.03241073**, while **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** has **-1.058498**).
   - The presence of **alkyl groups (methyl)** tends to slightly increase the property value compared to unsubstituted phenols (e.g., **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** is less negative than **c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC** at **-2.34325877**).

2. **Similar Molecules**:
   - **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (a dimethyl-substituted phenol) has a value of **-1.058498**.
   - **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (a dihydroxybenzene) has a value of **0.03241073**.
   - **c1ccccc1C(O)C(O)c2ccccc2** (a diphenylmethanol derivative) has a value of **-1.04449545**.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is structurally similar to **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** but with slightly less steric hindrance (only two methyl groups, one ortho and one meta/para). 
   - The property value is likely slightly higher (less negative) than **-1.058498** due to the simpler substitution pattern.

### Final Prediction:
The predicted property value for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** is approximately **-0.85**. 

This is based on interpolation between the values of similar phenol derivatives in the dataset, accounting for the effects of alkyl substitution.

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.5993872982373488
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property in question appears to correlate with molecular properties such as **logP (logarithm of the octanol-water partition coefficient)**, which describes hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity. The values range from highly negative (hydrophilic) to highly positive (hydrophobic). 

### Key observations from the examples:
1. **Highly chlorinated aromatic compounds** (e.g., `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl`) tend to have **high positive values** (e.g., **0.96427585**), indicating strong hydrophobicity.
2. **Polar groups (e.g., -OH, -NO2, -NH2, -CO)** reduce the value (e.g., `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` has **-0.65797142**).
3. **Symmetry and additional chlorines** further increase hydrophobicity (e.g., `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` has **1.2507042**).

### Target molecule:
`Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`  
This is a **polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-like structure** with **5 chlorine atoms** and a symmetric, hydrophobic aromatic system. 

### Comparison to similar examples:
- `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl` (6 chlorines): **0.96427585**  
- `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl` (7 chlorines): **1.2507042**  

The target has **5 chlorines**, fewer than the above examples but still highly hydrophobic. Its symmetry and biphenyl scaffold suggest a value **slightly lower than 0.96427585** but still significantly positive.

### Predicted value:
**~0.85**  
(Reasoning: Intermediate between the 6-chlorine and 7-chlorine examples, accounting for reduced chlorine count but retained aromatic hydrophobicity.)  

### Final answer:
**0.85** (estimated based on structural similarity and trend in the data).
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.6237995354646122
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene), I will analyze the given examples and identify structural and functional group trends that correlate with the property values. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Hydrocarbon Chains and Alkenes**:
   - **CCCCCCCCC=C** (nonene): Property = -0.69460754  
     This is a linear alkene with a single double bond.
   - **CCCCCCCC** (octane): Property = -0.04650505  
     This is a saturated hydrocarbon (no double bonds).
   - **CC=C(C)C** (isoprene) is a branched alkene with one double bond, similar to nonene but with branching.

2. **Branched vs. Linear Hydrocarbons**:
   - Branching tends to slightly increase the property value (make it less negative) compared to linear chains. For example:
     - **CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C** (branched alkane): Property = -0.35654866  
     - **CCCCCCCC** (linear alkane): Property = -0.04650505  
   - The presence of a double bond in a branched alkene (like isoprene) may further influence the property.

3. **Comparison to Similar Molecules**:
   - **CCCCCC(CC)C=O** (branched aldehyde): Property = -0.3554547  
     This has a polar carbonyl group, but the branching is somewhat analogous to isoprene.
   - **CC=C(C)C** lacks polar groups, so its property should be more negative than branched aldehydes but less negative than long linear alkenes like nonene.

### Prediction for **CC=C(C)C**:
- Isoprene is a branched alkene with one double bond. Based on the examples:
  - It should have a property value between **-0.35654866** (branched alkane) and **-0.69460754** (linear alkene).
  - The double bond and branching suggest a value closer to the middle of this range.

### Estimated Property Value:
**-0.50** (This is a reasonable interpolation based on the given data.)

### Final Answer:
The predicted property value for **CC=C(C)C** is **-0.50**.
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.4340067123867674
Predicted Property:
Given the provided examples, we can observe trends in how certain structural features influence the property value. Let's analyze the molecule **ClCCl** (dichloromethane) in the context of the given data:

### Key Observations from the Examples:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have negative property values, especially when the chlorines are on aromatic rings (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` has a value of -1.745). 
   - Aliphatic chlorinated compounds like `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) have a strongly negative value (-1.960).

2. **Small Aliphatic Chlorinated Molecules**:
   - `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) has a value of -1.960.
   - `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` (a heavily chlorinated aliphatic) has a positive value (1.574), but this is likely due to its complex polycyclic structure rather than just the chlorines.

3. **Dichloromethane (ClCCl)**:
   - This is a simple aliphatic molecule with two chlorines. It is less chlorinated than `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` but more chlorinated than monochlorinated examples (none provided in the data).
   - The presence of two chlorines suggests a moderately negative value, but not as extreme as heavily chlorinated examples.

### Prediction:
Given that:
- `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (4 chlorines) has a value of -1.960,
- `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (2 chlorines on an aromatic ring) has a value of -1.745,
- `ClCCl` is a smaller, less chlorinated aliphatic molecule, its value should be less negative than these but still negative.

A reasonable estimate for **ClCCl** is **-1.2**. This accounts for its simpler structure and fewer chlorines compared to the more negative examples.

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for ClCCl: -1.2**
==================================================
Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -2.0337055360493883
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, let's analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that correlate with the property values.

### Observations from the Given Data:
1. **Chlorine Substitution**: 
   - Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values when the chlorines are on an aromatic ring. For example:
     - **OC1C=CC2C1C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl** has 6 chlorines and a high value of **1.20496283**.
     - **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** (bromine analog) has a high value of **0.8517974**.
     - **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (3 chlorines) has a value of **-2.03370554**, but this also includes an oxygen (hydroxyl group), which may lower the value.

2. **Hydroxyl Group (OH)**:
   - The presence of a hydroxyl group (especially on an aromatic ring) tends to reduce the property value. For example:
     - **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(O)cc1** has a value of **-1.09876606**.
     - **CC=C(C(=CC)c1ccc(O)cc1)c2ccc(O)cc2** has a value of **0.24365387**, but this is offset by the large conjugated system.

3. **Aromatic Rings with Halogens**:
   - Aromatic rings with halogens (Cl, Br) generally have higher values unless paired with strongly polar groups like OH or NO₂.

### Analysis of the Target Molecule:
The target molecule is **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, which has:
- A phenol group (OH attached to benzene).
- Three chlorine substituents on the aromatic ring (positions 2, 4, and 6, assuming the OH is at position 1).

This is very similar to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (value = **-2.03370554**), except the target molecule has a chlorine at the 4-position instead of another hydrogen. The additional chlorine would likely increase the property value slightly compared to the reference molecule, but the hydroxyl group still suppresses it.

### Prediction:
Given the similarity to **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (value = **-2.03370554**), but with an extra chlorine (which would increase the value), I predict the property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** to be slightly higher, around:

**Predicted value: -1.8** (between -2.0 and -1.6, accounting for the additional chlorine's effect). 

However, looking back at the data, **Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1** (fully brominated benzene) has a value of **0.8517974**, while **Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl** (phenol with two chlorines) is much lower. The hydroxyl group seems to dominate the trend, so the additional chlorine may not increase the value much. 

Thus, a more conservative estimate would be closer to the reference molecule, perhaps:

**Final predicted value: -1.9** (slightly higher than -2.03370554 due to the extra chlorine). 

But to be precise, since the reference molecule with 2 chlorines is -2.033, and the target has 3 chlorines, I'll adjust upward by ~0.2, giving:

**Predicted value: -1.83**. 

Rounding to two decimal places: **-1.83**. 

However, the exact value is hard to pin down without a clear linear trend, so I'd suggest **-1.8** as a reasonable estimate. 

### Final Answer:
**Predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl: -1.83** (approximate). 

(Note: If the reference molecule was a typo and actually had 3 chlorines, the value would likely be closer to -1.8 to -1.9. If the reference had 2 chlorines, the extra chlorine would push it slightly higher, hence -1.83.)

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 2.349987059081897
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, functional groups, and overall polarity/hydrophobicity. The molecule in question is:

**COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67**

This is a highly complex, polycyclic structure with multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, alcohols, carbonyls) and sugar-like moieties (e.g., pyranose rings). Based on the examples:

1. **Oxygen-rich, polar molecules** (e.g., sugars, polyols) tend to have **positive property values** (e.g., `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` has **1.10380207**).
2. **Aromatic systems with polar substituents** (e.g., nitro, hydroxyl) often have **moderate positive or negative values** depending on balance (e.g., `Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` has **-0.65797142**).
3. **Large, hydrophobic alkanes** have **high positive values** (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` has **1.29369491**), but this molecule is polar, not hydrophobic.
4. **Complex polycyclic systems with mixed polar/nonpolar regions** (e.g., steroids, fused rings) often have **values between 0.5 and 1.5** (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` has **1.26250987**).

### Key features of the target molecule:
- Multiple ethers (`OCH3`, `OCO`), alcohols (`OH`), and a carbonyl (`C=O`).
- Fused ring systems resembling glycosides or flavones.
- High oxygen content (polar, likely hydrophilic).

### Prediction:
Given the structural similarity to oxygen-rich polycyclic examples (e.g., sugars, steroids), the property value is likely **positive and moderately high**, similar to other complex polar molecules in the dataset. 

**Predicted property value: ~1.15**  
*(Likely range: 0.9 to 1.3 based on comparable examples.)*  

### Rationale:
- The molecule is more polar than alkanes but less hydrophobic than pure hydrocarbons.
- The presence of multiple hydrogen-bonding groups (OH, OCH3, C=O) aligns with examples like `OCC1OC(...)C1O` (value: 1.1038) or steroid-like structures (values ~1.2–1.4).
- No strongly negative groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) are present to pull the value down. 

Thus, **1.15** is a reasonable estimate.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -1.0432485036620576
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**, let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the given examples to infer a plausible value.

### Structural Analysis:
1. **Core Structure**: The molecule contains a **thiazole-like ring** (with S and N atoms) fused to a **pyrimidine-like ring** (with N and C=O groups). This is somewhat similar to heterocyclic structures in the examples, such as:
   - `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (property: -0.97319733)
   - `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1` (property: -0.28092357)
   - `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (property: 0.07439602).

2. **Functional Groups**:
   - A **thioether (S-CH3)** group, which is moderately polar but less polar than oxygen analogs.
   - A **tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)**, which is bulky and hydrophobic.
   - A **urea-like fragment (N-C=O)** and an **amide (C=O-NH)**, which introduce polarity and hydrogen-bonding potential.

3. **Comparison to Examples**:
   - The molecule `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` has a somewhat similar structure (heterocycle with S, N, and C=O) and a tert-butyl group, with a property value of **0.07439602**.
   - The molecule `Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (property: -0.97319733) is more polar due to the O and N atoms but lacks the bulky tert-butyl group.
   - The molecule `Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1` (property: -0.28092357) has fewer heteroatoms but similar polarity.

4. **Expected Property**:
   - The presence of the **thioether** (less polar than oxygen) and the **tert-butyl group** (hydrophobic) would likely reduce the polarity compared to purely N/O-rich heterocycles.
   - The **amide and urea-like groups** add some polarity, but the bulky tert-butyl group may counterbalance this.
   - Given the similarity to `CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C` (property: 0.07439602), but with slightly less polarity due to the thioether replacing an oxygen, we might expect a slightly lower value.

### Predicted Property:
A reasonable estimate would be close to **0.0**, but slightly negative due to the thioether's reduced polarity. A plausible prediction is:

**Predicted property value: -0.15**  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on structural analogies. For precise predictions, computational tools or experimental data would be needed.)

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -1.056650328028815
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property appears to correlate with molecular features such as polarity, functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Molecule:** `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1`  
This is ethyl benzoate, which consists of:
1. An ethyl group (`CCO-`)  
2. An ester functional group (`-OC(=O)-`)  
3. A benzene ring (`c1ccccc1`).

### Observations from similar examples:
- **Aromatic rings with polar substituents** tend to have negative property values (e.g., `Oc1c(Cl)cccc1Cl` = -1.745, `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl` = -6.318).  
- **Esters** (e.g., `CCCC(=O)OC` = -0.405, `CCCCC(=O)OCC` = -0.405) tend to have moderately negative values.  
- The presence of an **ethyl group** (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)CO` = 0.173, `CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2` = 1.604) can slightly increase the value, but the ester and aromatic ring dominate.  

### Closest matches:
1. `CCCC(=O)OC` (butyl acetate) = -0.405  
2. `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (diphenyl ether) = -2.381  
3. `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (a benzofuranone derivative) = -2.624  

The given molecule is less polar than diphenyl ether but more polar than simple esters like butyl acetate. The benzene ring and ester group will pull the value downward, but the ethyl group slightly offsets this.  

### Predicted property value:
A reasonable estimate is **between -0.5 and -1.0**. Given the examples, I predict:  
**Predicted value: -0.75**  

*(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted, this is an educated guess based on trends in the data. The true property could be logP, solubility, or another descriptor.)*

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -4.23255134116811
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane), I will analyze the given examples and identify trends or patterns that correlate the molecular structure with the property value. Here's the reasoning:

### Observations from the Examples:
1. **Alkyl Halides**:
   - **CI** (iodomethane): Property value = **-0.74914335**
   - **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl** (hexachlorobiphenyl): Property value = **0.09613839**
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene): Property value = **-1.38308213**
   - **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O** (brominated heterocycle): Property value = **0.15803719**

   Halogens (Cl, Br, I) tend to introduce negative or slightly positive contributions, depending on the rest of the structure. Simple alkyl halides like iodomethane have negative values, while larger/bulkier halogenated structures can have positive values.

2. **Alkane Chains**:
   - **CCCC** (butane): Not explicitly given, but longer alkanes like **CCCCCCCC** (octane) or similar are present indirectly in other molecules.
   - **CCCC(=O)CCC** (heptan-4-one): Property value = **-0.0456372**
   - **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol): Property value = **-0.08598968**
   - **CCCCCCC=C** (heptene): Property value = **-0.00730849**

   Pure alkanes or simple functionalized alkanes tend to have small-magnitude values, often slightly negative or near zero.

3. **Brominated Alkanes**:
   - The closest analog is **CI** (iodomethane) with a value of **-0.74914335**, but this is a smaller molecule with iodine (which is more polarizable than bromine).
   - **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (bromonaphthalene) has a value of **-1.38308213**, but this is an aromatic system, which is not directly comparable.
   - **CCCCCCCBr** is a linear alkyl bromide, and alkyl halides with longer chains typically have less negative values than smaller ones (due to reduced polarity per unit size).

### Prediction for **CCCCCCCBr**:
- The property value is likely slightly negative, similar to other alkyl halides but less negative than **CI** because the bromine's effect is diluted over a longer chain.
- Comparing to **CCCCCCCO** (heptanol, -0.08598968), the bromine substituent is more polarizable than hydroxyl but less than iodine, so the value should be more negative than heptanol but less negative than iodomethane.
- A reasonable estimate is between **-0.2 and -0.5**.

Given the examples, I predict the property value for **CCCCCCCBr** to be approximately:  
**-0.35**.  

(Note: This is an educated guess based on the limited examples. For precise predictions, quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) modeling or more data would be needed.)
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.0158523462665452
Predicted Property:
Given the examples provided, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and functional groups. Here's the reasoning for predicting the property value for **CO (methanol, CH₃OH)**:

1. **Small, polar molecules with hydroxyl groups** tend to have negative or low-positive property values in the dataset. For example:
   - **OC1CCCCCC1 (cycloheptanol)**: -0.0456372  
   - **OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O (glucose-like structure)**: -4.81897433 (very negative due to high polarity and multiple hydroxyl groups).  
   - **CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O (terpene alcohol)**: -1.3403389.  

2. **Methanol (CO)** is a small, polar molecule with a single hydroxyl group. It lacks complex hydrophobic regions or aromaticity, which tend to increase the property value (e.g., aromatic nitro groups or large hydrophobic cores).  

3. Compared to **CCC (propane)**, which has a value of **0.9037335** (nonpolar, small hydrocarbon), methanol's polarity should significantly reduce the property value.  

4. The closest analog in the dataset is **CCC(C)CO (2-methyl-1-butanol)**, which has a value of **0.38892784**. However, methanol is simpler and more polar, so its value should be lower.  

### Predicted property value for **CO (methanol)**:  
**~ -0.5**  

This estimate balances the polarity of the hydroxyl group against the lack of molecular complexity. For precision, a value like **-0.45 to -0.55** would be reasonable, but based on the examples, a rounded prediction is:  
**-0.50**  

(Note: Without knowing the exact property being predicted—e.g., logP, solubility, or a synthetic score—this is an empirical estimate based on trends in the data.)  

---  
**Final answer**: **-0.50**
