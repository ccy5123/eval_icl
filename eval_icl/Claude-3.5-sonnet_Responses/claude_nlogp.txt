SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.6575908591326393
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (methyl decanoate) and predict its property value by comparing it to similar structures in the training examples and considering key molecular features:

1) It's a medium-length fatty acid methyl ester
2) Has a similar structure to "CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC" (methyl dodecanoate) from the examples, which has a value of 1.19140876
3) This molecule has two fewer carbons in the chain
4) Looking at other patterns in the data:
   - Longer carbon chains tend to increase the value
   - Ester groups generally contribute to moderate positive values
   - The property appears to correlate with lipophilicity

Considering these factors, I would predict a value of approximately 0.95

This prediction is based on:
- It should be lower than methyl dodecanoate (1.19) due to shorter chain length
- But higher than shorter-chain esters like CCOC(=O)CC (-0.94)
- The presence of the long alkyl chain and ester group suggests moderate lipophilicity

The value 0.95 represents a balanced consideration of these structural features and patterns observed in the training data.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.3862345645410203
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and patterns.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is a benzoxazinone derivative with:
- A chlorine substituent
- A fused bicyclic system
- An oxazinone ring (containing O, N, and C=O)
- Aromatic character

Looking at the training examples:
1. Molecules with similar heterocyclic structures tend to have negative values
2. The presence of chlorine typically increases the value
3. Fused ring systems generally contribute to slightly higher values
4. Molecules with amide-like groups (N-C=O) tend toward negative values
5. The size and complexity is moderate

Considering these factors:
- The heterocyclic nature and N-C=O group push toward negative values
- The chlorine and fused ring system partially counteract this
- The overall structure is relatively compact

Based on these considerations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account both the structural features that tend to increase the value (Cl, fused rings) and those that tend to decrease it (heterocyclic nature, N-C=O group).

Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.1409143248399483
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite, a relatively small molecule with:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- An isopropyl group (CC(C))
- No aromatic rings
- Polar functional groups

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Small molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative values (e.g., Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO at -1.5373983)
- Simple aliphatic molecules tend to have values between -1 and 0
- The presence of nitrogen and oxygen atoms typically pushes values more negative
- Molecules without aromatic rings tend to have lower values than their aromatic counterparts

Based on these observations and the structural similarities with other molecules in the training set, I would predict the property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O to be approximately:

-1.15

This prediction takes into account the molecule's small size, presence of the nitro group, and lack of aromatic systems, placing it in a similar range to other small, polar molecules in the training set.

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 0.22421446731637334
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the given molecule CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, I notice:

1. It's a complex steroid-like structure
2. Contains multiple rings (4 fused rings)
3. Has oxygen-containing functional groups (ketone, hydroxyl)
4. Contains multiple chiral centers
5. Similar in complexity to the steroid example in the training set: CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C (which had a value of 1.63149038)

Considering these factors:
- The overall structure is very similar to the steroid example
- It has slightly more polar groups (additional hydroxyl group)
- The molecular size and complexity are comparable
- The presence of additional oxygen-containing groups would slightly decrease the value compared to the similar steroid structure

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.45

This prediction takes into account that the additional polar groups would likely decrease the value somewhat from the 1.63 seen in the similar steroid structure, but the overall molecular framework would maintain a relatively high positive value.

True Property: 0.849168676796918
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1) The molecule contains:
- Two fluorine atoms on a benzene ring
- A urea linkage (-NC(=O)NC(=O)-)
- A chlorine on another benzene ring
- Overall, it's a relatively complex structure with both polar and nonpolar regions

2) Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
- Molecules with multiple halogens tend to have positive values
- Urea-containing structures (like CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O) have negative values around -1.3
- Aromatic systems with halogens typically have values between 0.2 and 0.8
- The presence of polar groups like C=O tends to decrease the value

3) Considering these factors:
- The halogen content would push the value up
- The urea linkage would pull it down significantly
- The overall polarity and size of the molecule suggests a moderate value

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.85

This prediction takes into account the competing effects of the halogens (which tend to increase the value) and the polar urea linkage (which tends to decrease it), while considering the overall molecular size and complexity.

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.35414528008225327
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCOC(C)C - propyl isopropyl ether) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with oxygen ethers tend to have negative values
2. Short-chain aliphatic compounds generally have values between -1 and 0
3. The presence of simple alkyl groups (propyl, isopropyl) typically leads to moderate negative values
4. Similar structures like CCOC(=O)CC has -0.94, but the carbonyl makes it more negative
5. Simple ethers and alcohols like CC1CCCO1 (-0.78) and CCCCCO (-0.80) have similar negative values

Given that CCCOC(C)C is:
- A simple ether
- Has moderate chain length
- Contains branching
- Is purely aliphatic
- Has similar structural elements to some training examples

I predict the property value would be approximately: -0.65

This prediction takes into account the molecule's relatively simple structure, the presence of the ether oxygen, and its similarity to other aliphatic ethers and alcohols in the training set, while accounting for its specific branching pattern.

The target molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O has several key features:
1. A pyrimidine-dione core structure
2. A bromine substituent
3. An ethyl and methyl branched N-substituent
4. A methyl group on the ring
5. Two carbonyl groups

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with bromine typically contribute moderately to the property (e.g., CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 has 0.04686814)
- Cyclic structures containing N and carbonyls tend to have negative values (e.g., O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC has -1.49170699)
- The presence of alkyl substituents slightly increases the value

Considering these factors and the overall molecular structure, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account:
- The negative contribution from the pyrimidine-dione core
- The slight positive contribution from the bromine
- The small positive contribution from the alkyl substituents
- The overall polarity and size of the molecule

Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.6941959064363495
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:
1. The property appears to correlate with molecular size and complexity
2. Aromatic compounds tend to have positive values
3. The presence of polar groups (like -OH, -NH2) tends to decrease the value
4. Highly conjugated systems tend to have higher positive values

For the target molecule "c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2" (biphenyl):
- It consists of two benzene rings connected directly
- It's a fully aromatic system
- It has no polar substituents
- It's relatively simple compared to some of the larger PAHs in the training set
- Similar structures in the training set have values around 0.5-1.0

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict the property value for biphenyl to be approximately:

0.71

This prediction takes into account that it's a purely aromatic hydrocarbon with moderate size, no polar groups, and shows similarity to other aromatic compounds in the training set.

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.4260553823555239
Predicted Property:

CCCCS is butanethiol, a relatively simple aliphatic molecule with:
- A straight chain of 4 carbons
- A terminal sulfur (thiol group)
- No rings, no double bonds, no complex functional groups

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Simple aliphatic chains tend to have values around 0 to 1
- CCCCCC(C)C has 0.60463328
- CCCCCCCC=C has 0.81687413
- Shorter chains tend to have lower values
- The presence of heteroatoms (like S) tends to decrease the value somewhat compared to pure hydrocarbons

Taking these factors into account, and considering that this molecule is:
- Shorter than the above examples
- Contains a sulfur which would reduce the value somewhat
- But still maintains a hydrophobic character

I would predict a value of approximately 0.25

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Lower than longer chain alkanes
- Higher than highly polar molecules
- In a moderate range considering its mixed character
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.36536626654544674
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with:
- A primary alcohol group (-OH)
- Two methyl branches
- A butyl chain backbone

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCCC(C)(C)C (branched alkane without OH) has value 0.07081537
- CC(C)CC(C)O (branched alcohol) has value -0.63336995
- CCCC(C)(O)CC (branched alcohol) has value -0.26786684

Key observations:
1. Adding an OH group tends to decrease the value compared to pure hydrocarbons
2. The length and branching of the carbon chain affects the value
3. Primary alcohols tend to have values in the negative range
4. The molecule is most similar to CCCC(C)(O)CC in terms of size and functionality

Based on these patterns, I would predict a value of approximately -0.31 for CCCC(C)(C)CO.

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's a primary alcohol (pushing value negative)
- It has similar branching to examples in training set
- It's slightly smaller than some of the reference molecules
- The position of the OH group is terminal

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.5536735771796003
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the given examples.

The molecule "Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1" is methylnaphthalene, which consists of:
- A naphthalene core (two fused benzene rings)
- A methyl (CH3) substituent

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- "Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1" (methylanthracene) has value 1.3427005
- "Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12" (dimethylnaphthalene) has value 0.76469654
- Simple "c1ccccc1" (benzene) has value -0.44637632

The target molecule is simpler than methylanthracene but very similar to dimethylnaphthalene, just with one less methyl group. It should have a value:
- Higher than benzene (due to larger size and methyl group)
- Lower than methylanthracene (as it has one less ring)
- Slightly lower than dimethylnaphthalene (as it has one less methyl group)

Based on these patterns, I predict the property value would be approximately 0.65

This takes into account:
1. The naphthalene core contribution
2. The single methyl substituent effect
3. The relative position compared to similar structures

True Property: -0.6759275931090769
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The given molecule is a barbiturate derivative with:
- A cyclic urea core (barbituric acid structure)
- An alkyl substituent with a terminal alkene
- Similar to example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C (-1.64496925)

2. Key observations:
- The main difference from the similar example is the longer alkyl chain
- The core structure remains the same (barbiturate)
- Both have terminal alkene groups
- The longer alkyl chain would increase lipophilicity slightly

3. Comparing with similar structures and patterns:
- Barbiturate-like structures tend to have negative values
- Adding alkyl chains generally increases the value slightly
- The presence of multiple polar groups (C=O, NH) contributes to lower values

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training examples, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-1.52

This value is slightly higher than the similar example (-1.64496925) due to the longer alkyl chain, but still maintains the negative value characteristic of highly polar barbiturate structures.

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which contains:
- A benzene ring
- A CF3 (trifluoromethyl) group

Looking at patterns from the examples:
1. Molecules with single benzene rings tend to have values around -0.5 to 0.5
2. Halogenated compounds (with Cl, Br, I) tend to increase the value
3. The size and polarity of the molecule affects the value
4. Fluorine substitutions typically have less impact than other halogens

Comparing to similar structures:
- Chlorobenzene derivatives show values around 0.4-0.5
- Simple aromatic compounds with small substituents tend to be in the -0.5 to 0.5 range
- The CF3 group is electron-withdrawing but compact

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 to be approximately:

0.32

This prediction takes into account that the CF3 group will have a similar but slightly lower impact compared to multiple chlorine substitutions, while maintaining the general range observed for monosubstituted benzene derivatives.

True Property: -3.8044617762159207
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, I can make several observations:

1. This molecule appears to be a sugar-like structure (cyclic polyol)
2. It has multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups
3. It's similar in structure to OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO (which has a value of -4.05351294)
4. It's a highly polar molecule due to multiple oxygen atoms and hydroxyl groups
5. The molecule is cyclic, unlike the linear sugar in the example, but maintains similar functionality

Given these observations, and particularly noting:
- The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups tends to drive the value strongly negative
- The structural similarity to the sugar molecule in the training set
- The slightly more compact (cyclic) structure compared to the linear sugar example

I would predict a value of approximately -3.8

This prediction is based on:
- It should be strongly negative like other highly hydroxylated compounds
- It should be slightly less negative than the linear sugar example (-4.05) due to its cyclic nature
- The presence of multiple oxygen atoms and hydroxyl groups consistently drives values negative in the training set

- Multiple ring systems (4 fused rings typical of steroids)
- Several oxygen-containing functional groups (ketone, acetate ester, hydroxyl groups)
- Multiple chiral centers
- Similar core structure to some of the training examples, particularly those with steroid backbones

2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C (1.71126886)
- CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C (1.32072379)

3. Key considerations:
- The target molecule has more polar groups than these examples
- It has an additional ketone and hydroxyl group
- The presence of acetate ester slightly increases lipophilicity
- The conjugated ketone system is similar to some training examples

Based on these factors, I would predict a value around 1.45 for this molecule. This prediction takes into account that:
- It's likely to be more polar than the first reference steroid (1.71) due to additional oxygen-containing groups
- But more lipophilic than the second reference (1.32) due to the acetate group
- The overall structural similarity to other steroids in the training set suggests it should fall in this range

Therefore, my specific prediction is: 1.45

- The presence of hydroxyl (-OH) and ketone (C=O) groups typically reduces the value somewhat compared to purely hydrocarbon structures

Considering these factors, and the overall molecular structure, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.82

This prediction takes into account:
1. The structural similarity to other steroids in the dataset
2. The presence of polar groups (OH and C=O)
3. The overall molecular size and complexity
4. The degree of saturation in the ring system

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the given examples.

CC(C)(C)CO is tert-butanol, a relatively simple alcohol with a tertiary carbon bearing three methyl groups and a primary alcohol group.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple alcohols tend to have negative values
2. Short-chain alcohols (like CC(C)CO) have values around -1.0 to -1.2
3. The presence of branching slightly increases the value compared to linear chains
4. Primary alcohols with nearby branching show values in this range

Comparing specifically with similar molecules from the examples:
- CC(C)CO (isopropanol) has a value of -1.16609312
- CCCCC(CC)CO has a value of -0.09845731 (but this is much longer)
- Simple short-chain molecules tend to be more negative

Given these patterns and the structural similarity to isopropanol (just one additional methyl group), I would predict the value for CC(C)(C)CO to be approximately:

   - c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 (anthracene) has a value of 1.92070446
   - Simpler aromatics like CCCc1ccccc1 have lower values around 0.20533037
   - The target molecule is less complex than anthracene but more complex than simple aromatics

4) The molecule has:
   - No polar groups
   - Is relatively planar
   - Has similar hydrophobic character to other PAHs in the dataset

Based on these considerations and the pattern in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately 0.95 for this molecule. This value would place it between simple aromatics and more complex PAH systems, which seems appropriate given its structural features.

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -1.983124621616702
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, I notice:
1. It contains a sulfonamide group -S(=O)(=O)-
2. Has multiple nitrogen atoms including amine groups (-NH2)
3. Contains a para-substituted benzene ring
4. Has polar groups that increase hydrophilicity
5. Is relatively small compared to many of the training examples
6. Contains guanidine-like structure

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Molecules with multiple polar groups tend to have negative values
- Sulfonamide-containing compounds tend to be in the negative range
- Molecules with multiple amino groups also tend toward negative values
- The size and complexity is moderate

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-1.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's polarity, size, and structural features while comparing it to the general trends seen in the training data.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.084604130576485
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, I notice:

1. It contains nitro groups (N(=O)=O)
2. Has a trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)
3. Contains an alkene group (C=C)
4. Has a tertiary amine structure
5. Contains an aromatic ring with multiple substituents

Analyzing similar structures from the training set:
- Molecules with nitro groups tend to have values around -0.7 to 0.5
- The presence of fluorine atoms typically increases the value
- Multiple heavy substituents on aromatic rings tend to push the value higher
- The tertiary amine and alkene portions would contribute to a slight increase

Taking all these structural features into account and comparing with the patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.82

This prediction takes into account the combined effects of the electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and trifluoromethyl), the presence of the tertiary amine, and the overall molecular complexity.

Iteration: 26
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -1.2118665380248972
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, a relatively simple ester.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Small molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have negative values
2. Esters generally show negative values (e.g., CC(C)CCOC=O at -0.77554806)
3. The molecule is similar in size and functionality to CC(C)CCOC=O but slightly smaller
4. Simple oxygenated compounds tend to be in the -0.5 to -1.0 range
5. The presence of branching (isopropyl group) typically makes the value less negative compared to linear chains

Based on these observations, particularly comparing with similar structures like CC(C)CCOC=O (-0.77554806) and CCCC=O (-0.92614191), but considering this molecule is smaller and has branching, I would predict the property value to be:

-0.85 (±0.1)

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- More negative than branched alcohols
- Similar to but slightly more negative than other small esters
- Less negative than linear aldehydes
- More negative than purely hydrocarbon structures

Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.22576077398752026
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethylphenol (two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a benzene ring).

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple phenols (like c1ccccc1O) have values around -0.65
2. Adding methyl groups to aromatic rings tends to increase the value slightly
3. The molecule is relatively small and has some polarity due to the OH group
4. It's similar in complexity to methylaniline (Cc1cccc(N)c1) which has a value of -0.52
5. The presence of hydroxyl groups generally decreases the value compared to pure hydrocarbons

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict the property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's more hydrophobic than simple phenol due to the two methyl groups
- But still has the hydroxyl group contributing to polarity
- It's in the same general size/complexity range as several molecules in the training set with similar values

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.8716927545023044
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has several key features:
1. It's an organophosphate structure with P=S group
2. Contains methoxy groups (OC) attached to phosphorus
3. Has an aromatic ring with methylthio (SC) and methyl (C) substituents
4. Overall structure is similar to other organophosphate compounds in the training set

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has value 1.50792269
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has value 1.47453341
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has value 1.58256962

The target molecule has a similar phosphate backbone but replaces the halogen substituents with methylthio (SC) and methyl (C) groups. These groups are generally less electronegative than halogens but still contribute to lipophilicity.

Considering these factors, I predict the property value would be slightly lower than the halogenated analogs but still positive, approximately:

1.35 ± 0.15

This prediction takes into account that the SC and C substituents would make the molecule less polar than the chlorinated versions but maintain similar structural characteristics.

Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 2.9294985146834915
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples provided.

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has several key characteristics:
1. It contains multiple chlorine atoms (5 Cl atoms)
2. It has a biphenyl-like structure (two benzene rings connected)
3. The chlorines are distributed across both rings
4. It's a relatively large, hydrophobic molecule

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has value 3.37655904
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has value 3.82361956

The target molecule is structurally similar to these examples but has:
- Fewer chlorine atoms than the second reference (5 vs 7)
- Similar to first reference but with slightly different chlorine positioning
- Maintains the basic biphenyl scaffold

Based on these observations and the pattern of values in the training set, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

2.95

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a high positive value due to its size and chlorination pattern, but slightly lower than the reference compounds due to having fewer chlorine substituents.
==================================================
Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -1.1398195944532952
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O, propyl nitrite) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. It has a short carbon chain (3 carbons)
3. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - Simple alkanes (CCC) tend to have negative values around -0.6
   - Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to decrease the value
   - Small molecules generally have lower absolute values
   - Oxygen-containing molecules often have negative values

Considering these patterns and comparing with similar structures in the training set, particularly looking at:
- Simple alkanes
- Molecules with nitro groups
- Molecules of similar size
- Oxygen-containing compounds

I would predict a value of approximately -0.75 for CCCN(=O)=O.

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly larger than ethane (-0.89) but has a nitro group that typically contributes to negative values, while not being as complex as some of the larger nitro-containing compounds in the training set.

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.17050425772120847
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a benzene ring substituted with both fluorine and bromine in different positions.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of 0.52239166 (dihalogenated benzene)
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 patterns show halogen substitutions affect the value
- Bromine generally contributes to higher values than fluorine
- Meta-substitution patterns (1,3) appear in several examples

Considering these factors:
1. The presence of bromine typically increases the value
2. Fluorine generally has a smaller effect than chlorine
3. The meta-substitution pattern is similar to some training examples
4. The molecule has similar size and halogen substitution pattern to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I predict the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 to be approximately:

0.45

This value is slightly lower than Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (0.52239166) because fluorine typically has a smaller effect than chlorine, but still maintains a positive value due to the presence of bromine and the overall aromatic halogenated structure.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.09955204453625945
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The target molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic structure with:
- Two connected rings
- Multiple methyl groups (C)
- One hydroxyl group (OH)
- Mostly saturated carbons

2. Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
- Molecules with hydroxyl groups tend to have negative values
- Bicyclic structures generally have values around -0.3 to 0.5
- The presence of methyl groups slightly increases the value
- Similar complexity molecules in the training set have moderate values

3. Most relevant examples from the training set:
- CC(C)(C)CO (-0.89918417) - similar in having methyl groups and OH
- CC1CCCO1 (-0.78936903) - similar in having a ring and similar complexity
- More complex steroids with OH groups tend to have values around -0.3 to 0.5

Based on these considerations and the structural features, I predict the property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate complexity, presence of OH group (pushing negative), and methyl substituents (slightly increasing the value).

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.1649621851387777
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and my understanding of molecular structures.

The target molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has several key features:
1. A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
2. Two ethoxy groups (OCC)
3. A phthalimide ring system
4. Similar structure to some of the training examples, particularly the one containing phthalimide and phosphorothioate groups

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
- More complex, larger molecules tend to have higher values
- Presence of aromatic rings generally increases the value
- Presence of heteroatoms (N, O, S, P) tends to decrease the value somewhat
- Similar compounds with phthalimide structures show values around 0.7-1.1

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the training set, particularly the compound CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O which has a value of 1.05313063, I would predict the property value for the target molecule to be approximately:

0.82

This prediction takes into account that the target molecule is slightly smaller than the closest analog in the training set (missing the CCl group) which should lower the value somewhat, but maintains similar key structural features.
==================================================
Iteration: 34
SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -0.5847091836412134
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1) The target molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a pyrazolone derivative with:
- A phenyl substituent
- Two methyl groups
- A carbonyl group
- A heterocyclic core

2) Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- It has some similarity to Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O (0.45399838)
- Contains N-heterocyclic elements like some other examples
- Has aromatic rings and polar groups

3) Considering the structural features:
- It's smaller than many of the highly positive value compounds
- Has moderate polarity due to the C=O and N atoms
- Contains both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions
- Size and complexity is in the middle range of the examples

4) Based on these considerations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a value around:

0.15 to 0.25

My specific prediction would be: 0.19

This takes into account that the molecule has some structural similarities to other heterocyclic compounds in the dataset while being somewhat smaller and less complex than those with very high values, but more complex than simple molecules with negative values.

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.14313599805488286
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCC(=O)OCC - ethyl hexanoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Longer carbon chains tend to increase the value
2. Esters (C(=O)OC) generally have values around -1 to 0
3. Simple aliphatic compounds without additional functional groups tend to have values between -0.5 and 0.5
4. The presence of oxygen atoms typically decreases the value
5. Linear structures tend to have more moderate values than cyclic or complex structures

For ethyl hexanoate:
- It has a medium-length carbon chain (hexanoate part)
- Contains an ester group
- Is relatively linear
- Has two oxygen atoms
- Similar compounds in the training set like CCOC(=O)N (-1.5308436) and COC=O (-1.74458971) have negative values, but this molecule has a longer carbon chain which would increase the value

Considering these factors and comparing to similar structures, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.15

This takes into account the negative contribution of the ester group balanced against the positive contribution of the longer carbon chain.
==================================================
Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.5923859804776176
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples and my understanding of molecular structures.

The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is methyl benzoate, which consists of:
- A benzene ring (c1ccccc1)
- A carboxylate ester group (-C(=O)O-)
- A methyl group (-CH3)

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) has a value of -0.32547703
- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 (with an additional OH group) has a value of -0.52690742

The target molecule is very similar to ethyl benzoate, just with a methyl ester instead of an ethyl ester. Since methyl groups are slightly smaller than ethyl groups, and considering the general trend in the data where smaller molecules tend to have slightly more negative values, I would predict the property value to be:

-0.42

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The core structure is nearly identical to ethyl benzoate
2. The methyl ester would make it slightly more polar than ethyl benzoate
3. The smaller size would likely push the value slightly more negative
4. The absence of additional substituents keeps it in a similar range to the simple benzoate esters in the training set
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.4040239333241318
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. The property appears to correlate with molecular complexity and size
2. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have values between -1 and 0
3. Molecules with similar structures tend to have similar values
4. Unsaturated hydrocarbons (with double bonds) tend to have slightly higher values than their saturated counterparts

Looking at C=CCC=C (1,4-pentadiene):
- It's a small, simple hydrocarbon
- It has two double bonds
- It's similar in size to CC/C=C/C (trans-2-pentene) which has a value of -0.25076168
- However, it has an additional double bond which might slightly increase the value
- It's also similar to other small unsaturated hydrocarbons in the training set

Based on these observations and comparing with similar molecules in the training set, particularly CC/C=C/C (-0.25076168) and other simple hydrocarbons, I would predict the property value for C=CCC=C to be approximately:

-0.20

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly more unsaturated than CC/C=C/C but remains a simple, small hydrocarbon.

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.0791626910848464
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (tribromomethane/bromoform - CBr3H) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Halogenated compounds generally have positive values
2. Small molecules with multiple halogens tend to have values between 0 and 1
3. Similar structures like FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br have values around 0.12
4. The more halogens present, typically the higher the value
5. Bromine substituents tend to give slightly higher values than chlorine (comparing similar structures)

Given that CBr3H:
- Is a small molecule
- Contains three bromine atoms
- Has similar structural features to other halogenated methanes in the dataset
- Bromine atoms typically contribute more to the property than chlorine

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CBr3H to be approximately:

0.45

This prediction takes into account that it should have a higher value than chlorinated analogs but lower than larger polyhalogenated aromatic compounds seen in the training set.

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The given molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has several key features:
1. Organophosphate structure with P=S
2. Multiple oxygen atoms
3. A chlorine substituent
4. Aromatic ring system
5. Cyclic imide structure
6. Mixed aliphatic and aromatic components

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with P=S and aromatic rings tend to have values around 1.3-1.4 (like COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 at 1.36355512)
- Presence of chlorine typically increases the value
- Cyclic structures with carbonyls tend to have moderate positive values
- The combination of aromatic and aliphatic regions suggests a moderately lipophilic compound

Based on these structural considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.28

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to other organophosphates in the training set while considering the additional complexity of the imide ring system and chlorine substituent.

True Property: 0.3632452264213069
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains several key structural features:
- A urea linkage (N-C(=O)-N)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring
- A heterocyclic ring system with N-N and O
- A tert-butyl group
- N,N-dimethyl group

2. Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Molecules with urea-like structures tend to have negative values
- Chlorinated aromatics generally contribute to positive values
- N,N-dimethyl groups (as seen in CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C) contribute to negative values
- Complex heterocycles with multiple heteroatoms tend to have values around -0.5 to 0.5

3. Considering the size and complexity:
- The molecule is moderately sized
- Has a good balance of polar and nonpolar regions
- Contains both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account the competing effects of the polar groups (which tend to decrease the value) and the chloro/tert-butyl groups (which tend to increase it), while considering the overall molecular complexity.

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 1.9196781536452436
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has:
- A phenoxy linkage between two aromatic rings
- Three chlorine substituents
- One hydroxyl group
- Similar structural elements to some training examples, particularly the chlorinated phenols

Looking at relevant examples from the training set:
- Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl (dichlorophenol) has a value of 0.24631434
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (tetrachlorophenol) has a value of 1.14043538
- Other chlorinated aromatics like c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2 has a value of 1.14125643

The target molecule is larger than the dichlorophenol but smaller than the tetrachlorophenol. It has a similar number of chlorines (3) and contains a phenoxy bridge which would contribute to lipophilicity.

Based on these structural considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value would be approximately:

0.85

This value reflects that it should be:
- Higher than dichlorophenol due to additional aromatic ring and chlorine
- Lower than tetrachlorophenol due to fewer chlorines
- In a similar range to other chlorinated biphenyls in the training set
==================================================
Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.25076167919270853
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to make a prediction.

The molecule CC/C=C\C is a pentene (C5H10) with a trans (E) configuration at the double bond, while one of the training examples CC/C=C/C is the same molecule but with a cis (Z) configuration, which had a value of -0.25076168.

Key observations:
1. The molecules are constitutional isomers (same molecular formula, different arrangement)
2. The only difference is the stereochemistry at the double bond
3. Trans isomers typically have slightly different physical properties than cis isomers, but the differences are usually small
4. Trans isomers are generally slightly more stable and less polar than cis isomers

Given that the cis isomer has a value of -0.25076168, and considering that trans isomers typically have values close to but slightly different from their cis counterparts, I would predict the property value for CC/C=C\C to be approximately:

-0.23 to -0.24

My specific prediction would be: -0.23576168

This prediction takes into account that trans isomers often have slightly higher values than their cis counterparts in many physical properties, while still maintaining a very close relationship to the known example.

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.6199595020914406
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCOCC - ethyl propyl ether) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple alcohols and short-chain molecules tend to have negative values
2. Ethers generally have values less negative than their alcohol counterparts
3. Increasing carbon chain length tends to make values more positive
4. The molecule in question is a relatively simple ether with 5 carbons

Analyzing similar structures from the examples:
- Simple alkanes like methane (C) have value around -1.16
- Simple alcohols (CC(C)O) have value around -1.33
- Longer chain molecules tend to be less negative or positive
- Ethers typically have values between alcohols and pure hydrocarbons

Given these patterns and the structure of CCCOCC, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's more complex than simple alcohols (so less negative)
- It's an ether (generally less negative than alcohols)
- It has a moderate carbon chain length
- It lacks any complex functional groups or aromatic structures

True Property: 0.9775258146319861
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, I notice:
1. It contains two phenyl rings (c1ccccc1 and c2ccccc2)
2. Has a urea-like structure (C(=O)N)
3. Contains tertiary carbon with two methyl groups
4. Has N-methylation

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with two phenyl rings typically have values around 0.7 to 1.0
- The presence of polar groups like C(=O)N tends to decrease the value
- N-methylation and additional alkyl groups slightly increase the value
- The overall polarity and size is similar to some of the pharmaceutical-like compounds in the training set

Based on these observations and patterns, particularly looking at similar sized molecules with comparable functional groups, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.32

This prediction takes into account the balance between the lipophilic character of the phenyl rings and alkyl groups, and the polar nature of the urea-like portion of the molecule.

True Property: 0.046868144678582115
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is acetanilide with a bromine substituent (4-bromoacetanilide).

1. Molecules with Br substituents on benzene rings tend to have values around 0 to 1 (e.g., Fc1cccc(Br)c1: 0.17050426)
2. Molecules with amide groups (-NC(=O)-) generally reduce the value
3. Para-substituted aromatics with Br show moderate values (Oc1ccc(Br)cc1: -0.12609926)
4. The presence of acetyl group (CC(=O)-) typically reduces the value somewhat
5. Aniline derivatives (Cc1ccc(N)cc1: -0.52121482) tend to have negative values

Considering these factors:
- The bromine would push the value up
- The amide group would push it down
- The overall structure is relatively simple and balanced

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 to be approximately:

-0.15

This takes into account both the electron-withdrawing effect of the bromine and the polarity introduced by the acetamido group, while considering the overall molecular size and structure.

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.37364516509451073
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, which is isobutylbenzene) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1) It's a benzene ring with an isobutyl substituent
2) Similar compounds in the training set include:
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethyltoluene): 0.14944438
- CC1CCCCC1 (methylcyclohexane): 0.16940953
- Cc1cccc2ccccc12 (methylnaphthalene): 0.55367358
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (p-cymene): 0.53328422

Looking at the patterns:
- Simple alkylbenzenes tend to have values between 0.1 and 0.6
- Branched alkyl groups tend to increase the value slightly
- The size of the alkyl group also affects the value
- The molecule is most similar to p-cymene, but with one less methyl group

Based on these observations and the trends in the training data, I would predict the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 to be approximately:

0.35

This value takes into account that it's a branched alkylbenzene (like p-cymene) but with slightly less substitution, placing it between the values for simple ethylbenzene derivatives and more heavily substituted aromatics.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.5746650323436718
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with simple aromatic rings tend to have values between -0.5 and 0.5
2. The presence of oxygen atoms, especially in carbonyl groups, tends to decrease the value
3. Simple benzene derivatives with small substituents typically have moderate negative to small positive values
4. The molecule in question (benzaldehyde) has:
   - One benzene ring
   - One aldehyde group (C=O)
   - A relatively simple structure

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- COc1ccccc1 (anisole) has -0.44049214
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (salicylamide) has -1.26434518
- Simple aromatic compounds with oxygen-containing groups tend to be slightly negative

Based on these observations, I predict the property value for benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) to be approximately:

-0.65

This prediction takes into account that benzaldehyde is slightly more polar than anisole but less polar than salicylamide, and considers the general trends seen in the training data for aromatic compounds with oxygen-containing substituents.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -1.5500698068515157
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains a furan ring (5-membered oxygen heterocycle) with a nitro group
2. It has a cyclic urea structure (hydantoin-like)
3. There's a hydrazone linkage connecting these parts
4. The molecule contains several polar groups (C=O, NO2)
5. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
   - Molecules with nitro groups tend to have higher values
   - Heterocyclic compounds with multiple heteroatoms tend to have lower values
   - The presence of multiple polar groups tends to decrease the value
   - Molecules with similar size and complexity in the training set tend to have values between -1 and 1

Considering these factors and comparing with the training examples, particularly those containing heterocycles and polar groups, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's polarity, size, and structural features while comparing it to similar molecules in the training set.

Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.5381968263382932
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally very similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training examples, which has a value of 1.20625604. The only difference is that our target molecule has an NH linkage instead of a N=N linkage.

Key observations:
1. Both molecules have two phenyl rings
2. Both are connected by nitrogen atoms
3. The main difference is the saturation of the nitrogen bridge
4. The NH linkage would make it slightly more polar than the N=N version

Given that:
- The presence of NH instead of N=N typically reduces lipophilicity slightly
- The overall molecular structure remains very similar
- The molecule maintains similar size and aromatic character

I would predict a value of approximately 1.05 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that the NH linkage would slightly decrease the property value compared to its N=N analog, but the core diphenyl structure would still maintain a relatively high value similar to other biphenyl-like structures in the training set.

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 has these key characteristics:
1. It's a cyclic imide structure
2. Contains a cyclopentane ring fused to the imide
3. Has multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)
4. Contains a relatively compact structure
5. Has moderate polarity due to the imide groups

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1 has value -1.3422763
- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC has value -0.78957429
- O=C1CCCN1 has value -1.67124278

The target molecule shares structural similarities with these examples, particularly:
- The presence of cyclic amide/imide groups
- Similar molecular size
- Similar polarity characteristics

Considering these factors and the values of similar molecules, I predict the property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 to be approximately:

-1.15

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly more complex than O=C1CCCN1 but simpler than O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, and has structural elements common to molecules with negative values in this range.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 2.0353774713846344
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the given training examples. The molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine substituents.

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Molecules with multiple chlorines tend to have positive values
2. Biphenyl-like structures generally contribute to higher values
3. Similar compounds like "Clc1ccccc1Cl" has a value of 0.44774473
4. More complex chlorinated aromatics like "Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl" has a value of 2.84390428

This molecule has:
- A biphenyl core structure
- Three chlorine substituents
- Similar structural features to several training examples

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately 1.2 to 1.4 for this molecule. More specifically, I would estimate:

1.31

This takes into account that it's more complex than dichlorobenzene but less chlorinated than the pentachlorinated compound in the training set.

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.32321914665930546
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a para-diethylbenzene (a benzene ring with two ethyl groups in para position).

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with benzene rings generally have values between -0.5 and 1.0
2. Adding alkyl groups (especially ethyl, propyl, etc.) to benzene tends to increase the value
3. Symmetric substitutions often lead to more moderate values
4. Similar structures like CCCCCCc1ccccc1 (phenylhexane) has a value of 1.00605723
5. Simple aromatic amines like Cc1ccccc1N have values around -0.52

Given that this molecule:
- Has a benzene ring (base contribution)
- Has two ethyl groups (increasing lipophilicity)
- Is symmetrical
- Is less lipophilic than phenylhexane
- Has no polar groups

I would predict a value of approximately 0.35

This takes into account that it should be:
- Higher than simple benzene derivatives
- Lower than long-chain alkylbenzenes
- More positive than polar aromatic compounds
- In line with other symmetric, non-polar aromatics

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -1.657695487989341
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The target molecule is sulfanilamide (Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O), which has:
- An aniline group (aromatic amine)
- A sulfonamide group
- A relatively simple structure

2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a value of -0.79504794
- Other molecules with amine groups tend to have negative values
- Molecules with sulfur-containing groups generally have values in the moderate range
- Simple aromatic structures with polar substituents tend toward negative values

3. Key considerations:
- The molecule is relatively polar due to both NH2 groups and the SO2 group
- It's smaller than many of the highly positive value compounds
- It has similar polarity characteristics to the nitroaniline example

Based on these observations and patterns, particularly comparing to similar structures and functional groups in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.85

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a negative value due to its polarity and similarity to other amine-containing aromatics, but slightly more negative than the nitroaniline example due to the additional polar sulfonamide group.

Iteration: 54
SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 1.469812385380017
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples. The molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 is pyrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. PAHs and highly conjugated aromatic systems tend to have positive values
2. Similar structures like c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 (2.25883931) and c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 (2.13172743) have values around 2.1-2.3
3. The size and conjugation of pyrene is slightly smaller than these examples
4. The molecule lacks any substituents that might significantly alter the property

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to other PAHs in the training set, I predict the property value for pyrene to be:

1.95

This value takes into account that pyrene is a smaller PAH system than some of the examples shown, but still maintains high conjugation and aromaticity characteristic of molecules with positive values in this range.

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: -0.08449950171978021
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule has several key features:
1. Multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups (4 in total)
2. A fused ring system
3. A ketone group (C=O)
4. An ether linkage (O)
5. Aromatic rings

Looking at the training examples:
- Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups tend to have negative values (e.g., Oc1cccc(O)c1 = -0.8492371)
- However, larger fused ring systems tend to increase the value (e.g., various fused ring examples show positive values)
- The presence of oxygen-containing functional groups (ketone, ether) in conjugated systems also influences the property

Considering these factors:
- The multiple hydroxyl groups will push the value down
- The fused ring system will push the value up
- The overall size and complexity of the molecule will contribute positively
- The oxygen-rich nature of the molecule will contribute negatively

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account the competing effects of the hydrophilic hydroxyl groups and the more lipophilic fused ring system, along with the overall molecular complexity.

Iteration: 56
SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: -0.7519429343322958
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule by comparing its structural features with the training examples and considering key molecular characteristics:

1. The molecule contains a phosphate group (P=O) similar to some training examples
2. It has a relatively small size and moderate complexity
3. Contains sulfur and nitrogen atoms
4. Has acetyl group (NC(C)=O)
5. Contains methoxy (COP) and thiomethyl (SC) groups

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Phosphate-containing molecules generally have values ranging from 0 to 2
- Smaller molecules tend to have lower values
- Presence of S and N atoms often reduces the value
- Acetyl groups typically contribute to negative values
- The combination of P=O and S is seen in some pesticide-like structures

Considering all these factors and comparing with the most similar structures in the training set (especially phosphate-containing compounds), I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account that this molecule is smaller and has more polar groups than many of the higher-valued phosphate compounds in the training set, while also considering the presence of the acetyl group which tends to reduce the value.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.2762825813315571
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (trans-1,2-dichloroethene) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Small, halogenated molecules tend to have values around -0.5 to 0.5
2. The presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the value
3. Double bonds can affect the value
4. The molecule's size and complexity correlate with the magnitude of the value
5. Symmetric structures tend to have more moderate values

For trans-1,2-dichloroethene:
- It's a small molecule
- Has two chlorine atoms
- Contains a trans double bond
- Symmetric structure
- Similar in size/complexity to molecules like CCBr (-0.64164885)
- More halogenated than CCBr but smaller than heavily chlorinated aromatics

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.15

This value takes into account the molecule's small size (which tends to give negative values in the training set) balanced against the presence of two chlorines (which tend to increase the value) and the trans double bond configuration.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple aromatic structures tend to have moderate values
2. Nitrogen-containing heterocycles generally show negative values
3. The more complex and larger the aromatic system, the more positive the value becomes
4. Simple heterocycles with nitrogen tend to have values between -1.3 and -0.2

Specifically looking at similar structures in the training set:
- COc2ncc1nccnc1n2: -1.30724492 (more complex, but similar N-heterocycle)
- Cc1ncnc2nccnc12: -1.10210613 (more complex N-heterocycle)
- CNc1ccccc1: -0.4178449 (aniline derivative)
- c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23: 0.30378768 (much more complex fused system)

Given that pyridine is:
- A simple aromatic heterocycle
- Contains one nitrogen
- Has no substituents
- Is smaller than most examples

I predict the property value would be approximately: -0.45

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Less negative than the complex N-heterocycles
- Similar to but slightly more negative than simple aniline derivatives
- More negative than fused ring systems
- In line with the general trend for simple N-heterocycles

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23

Key observations:
1. It contains multiple aromatic rings (including a quinoline-like structure)
2. Has a chlorine substituent
3. Contains polar groups (OH, ester linkage)
4. Has an amine linkage between aromatic systems
5. Contains oxygen-containing functional groups

Analyzing similar structures from the examples:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have higher values
- Chlorine substituents generally contribute to positive values
- Polar groups (OH, C=O) tend to decrease the value
- Amine linkages between aromatics contribute moderately positive values
- Complex fused ring systems increase the value

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the training set, particularly:
- CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2 (-0.60812273)
- O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 (0.67845916)
- Complex aromatic systems with Cl (~0.4 to 1.0)

I predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately:

0.45

This prediction takes into account the competing effects of the polar groups (reducing the value) and the aromatic/chlorinated portions (increasing the value).

1. Molecules with oxygen groups (-OH, -CO) tend to have lower values
2. Longer carbon chains tend to increase the value
3. Simple aliphatic molecules tend to have values between -0.5 and 0.5
4. The presence of -OH group typically reduces the value compared to pure hydrocarbons

CCCCCO is a primary alcohol with:
- 5 carbon straight chain
- Terminal hydroxyl group
- No branching
- No other functional groups

Comparing to similar molecules in the examples:
- OC1CCCCCCC1 (cyclic alcohol) has -0.16927269
- CCOC=O (ethyl formate) has -1.47768076
- CCCCC(=O)CCCC (ketone) has 0.40840285

Given that this is a straight-chain primary alcohol, shorter than the cyclic alcohol example but longer than ethyl formate, and considering the general trends, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.22

This takes into account both the hydrophobic contribution of the carbon chain and the hydrophilic effect of the terminal hydroxyl group.

1) The target molecule contains:
- A cyclic structure with oxygen and sulfur
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O))
- An amide group (C(=O)N)
- A phenyl ring
- Methyl substituent

2) Looking at patterns in the training examples:
- Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher values

- The presence of the sulfonyl group and oxygen in the ring will likely pull the value down
- The amide linkage is similar to some examples that have negative values

Based on these considerations and the structural features, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.42

This prediction takes into account the competing effects of the aromatic portion (which would increase the value) and the polar groups (which would decrease it), while considering the overall complexity and size of the molecule.

3. Considering the overall structure:
- The molecule has a good balance of polar and non-polar regions
- It's relatively large but not as large as the polycyclic aromatics in the training set
- The substitution pattern suggests moderate electronic effects

Based on these considerations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

SMILES: ClCC
True Property: -0.7484534812248392
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (ClCC - chloroethane) and predict its property value by comparing it with the given examples and considering its structural features:

2. Looking at similar simple structures in the training set:
- CCCCC (pentane) has -0.09749943
- Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) has 0.00068421
- CC#N (acetonitrile) has -1.23781165
- Simple aliphatic molecules tend to have values near zero or slightly negative

The molecule ClCC (chloroethane) is simpler than most examples given, but considering:
- Its small size
- Single chlorine substitution
- Aliphatic nature
- Similarity to other simple molecules in the set

I would predict a value of approximately -0.15

This takes into account that it should:
- Be slightly negative like other simple aliphatics

True Property: 0.8365792773504072
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and my understanding of molecular structures.

The target molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has several key features:
1. A pyridine ring (6-membered aromatic ring with nitrogen)
2. A chlorine directly attached to the pyridine ring
3. A trichloromethyl group (-C(Cl)3) attached to the pyridine ring
4. Overall high halogen content

Looking at similar structures from the training examples:

- The presence of nitrogen in aromatic rings tends to slightly decrease the value compared to pure hydrocarbons
- Molecules with similar size and halogen content like ClC(Cl)Cl have values around -0.21
- More complex chlorinated aromatics like Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl have values around 2.03

Considering these factors, I would predict a value of approximately 0.85 for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl.

This prediction takes into account:
- The moderating effect of the pyridine nitrogen
- The multiple chlorine substituents
- The overall molecular size and complexity
- The presence of both aromatic and aliphatic chlorine atoms

True Property: -0.5347757938800023
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

CCCCC(C)O is a branched primary alcohol with 6 carbons (hexanol with a methyl branch).

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCC(CC)CO: -0.63227522 (branched C5 alcohol)
- CCCC(O)CCC: -0.26786684 (branched C7 alcohol)
- CC(O)c1ccccc1: -0.40990811 (aromatic alcohol)
- CCCCCCO: not directly present but would be relevant

The target molecule CCCCC(C)O is most similar to CCC(CC)CO, as both are branched aliphatic alcohols. The target molecule has one more carbon but maintains similar functionality. The property values for alcohols in the training set tend to be negative, especially for simpler aliphatic alcohols.

Given these observations and the fact that our target molecule is slightly larger than CCC(CC)CO but should maintain similar chemical properties, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.55

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The molecule is slightly larger than CCC(CC)CO (-0.63227522)
2. The branching pattern is similar
3. The presence of the alcohol group consistently leads to negative values
4. The longer carbon chain would make it slightly less negative than CCC(CC)CO

The molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is 1,4-dibromobenzene, which has two bromine atoms in para position on a benzene ring.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Halogenated aromatics generally have positive values (e.g., chlorinated benzenes)
2. Di-halogenated benzenes show values around 0.2-1.6
3. The size of bromine is larger than chlorine, which might increase the value slightly
4. Similar structures like Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl have values around 1.5-1.6

Considering these factors:
- The molecule is symmetric and relatively simple
- It has two bromine substituents which are larger than chlorine
- It lacks any additional functional groups
- Its structure is most similar to dichlorobenzene derivatives in the training set

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account that bromine substituents would likely lead to a value somewhat similar to but slightly different from chlorinated analogs, while maintaining the general trend seen for dihalogenated aromatic compounds in the training set.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 3.3765590363329196
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and the target molecule, I notice this is likely a property related to molecular characteristics, possibly related to lipophilicity or similar physicochemical property. Let me analyze the target molecule:

Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 6 chlorine atoms on a biphenyl backbone.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- The most similar molecule is "Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" with a value of 5.16480112, which has 10 chlorines
- Other aromatic structures with multiple halogens tend to have positive values
- The target molecule has 6 chlorines (vs 10 in the reference), but maintains the biphenyl core

Given that:
1. The reference PCB with 10 chlorines has a value of ~5.16
2. Our target has 6 chlorines (4 fewer)
3. Each chlorine appears to contribute positively to the property
4. The biphenyl core structure is maintained

I would predict a value of approximately 3.2 for this molecule. This takes into account that removing 4 chlorines should significantly reduce the value compared to the 10-chlorine reference, but the molecule should still maintain a substantial positive value due to its 6 remaining chlorines and hydrophobic biphenyl structure.

My predicted value: 3.2

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 2.6805568247585967
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule (Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1), I notice:

1. It's an organophosphate compound with P=O group
2. Contains three aromatic rings
3. Has methyl substituents on each aromatic ring
4. Contains O-P-O linkages
5. Has a relatively complex, symmetric structure

Analyzing the training examples:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have values between 0.5 and 2.0
- Presence of phosphate groups tends to give moderate positive values
- Methyl substituents on aromatic rings typically increase the value slightly
- Complex molecules with multiple oxygen atoms tend to moderate the extremely high values

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

1.15

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, aromaticity, and the presence of the phosphate group while considering the moderating effect of the oxygen atoms.

True Property: 0.8042163102949784
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the target molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, I notice:

1. It contains a trifluoromethyl group (CF3)
2. Has a benzene ring
3. Contains a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring with a ketone
4. Has two chlorine atoms
5. Overall, it's a relatively complex structure with both polar and nonpolar regions

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with CF3 groups tend to have values around 0-1
- Chlorinated compounds generally increase the value
- The presence of a ketone group typically reduces the value somewhat
- Aromatic rings with substituents tend to give moderate positive values

Taking all these structural features into account and comparing with the patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.48

This prediction considers that the molecule has features that would both increase the value (CF3, Cl atoms) and decrease it (ketone, N-heterocycle), leading to a moderate positive value.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.503302295263728
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The target molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is a nitro-anisole (methoxybenzene with a nitro group).

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Aromatic compounds generally have values between -1 and 1
2. Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to decrease the value (as seen in O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O at -0.57199663)
3. Methoxy groups (COc) tend to have a moderate effect
4. Single-ring aromatics with substituents typically fall in the -0.5 to 0.5 range

Considering these factors:
- The base aromatic structure would suggest a value near 0
- The nitro group would push it negative (around -0.5)
- The methoxy group would slightly moderate this effect

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O to be approximately:

-0.32

This takes into account the structural features and their typical effects on the property value as seen in the training examples.

True Property: 2.287849666806488
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples. Let me break down my reasoning:

1. The target molecule is a complex polychlorinated structure with multiple chlorine atoms and a cyclic/bridged system.

2. Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
- Chlorinated compounds generally have values ranging from -0.6 to 1.4
- More complex/larger structures tend to have higher values
- Multiple chlorine substitutions tend to increase the value
- Cyclic structures generally have higher values than linear ones
- ClCCCl has a value of -0.59868068
- The hexachlorocyclohexane derivative has a value of 0.89316315

3. The target molecule has:
- Multiple chlorine atoms (more than the examples)
- A complex bridged ring system
- Similar structural complexity to some of the higher-valued examples
- More halogen substitution than most examples

4. Given these factors:
- The complexity and multiple chlorine atoms will push the value higher
- The bridged ring system will contribute to a positive value
- The overall structure suggests a value higher than simpler chlorinated compounds

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.15

This prediction takes into account the structural complexity, degree of chlorination, and cyclic nature of the molecule, while staying within the general range observed in the training examples.

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -1.2107718076382443
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCOC=O, propyl formate) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a formate ester group
2. Similar compounds in the training set:
- Simple esters tend to have negative values
- Short chain compounds with oxygen tend to be negative
- The presence of C=O group generally contributes to more negative values
- Compounds with similar size and polarity tend to be in the -0.3 to -0.7 range

Looking at analogous structures and patterns in the training data:
- Simple alcohols like CCCC(O)CC have value around -0.53
- Compounds with ester groups tend to be slightly negative
- The length of the alkyl chain (3 carbons) will make it slightly less negative than shorter chain compounds

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCCOC=O to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's polarity, size, and functional group characteristics while considering the trends observed in the training set.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.9244998115284798
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC - ethyl decanoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice several patterns:
1. Longer alkyl chains tend to increase the value
2. Esters generally have moderate positive to slightly negative values
3. The presence of oxygen atoms tends to decrease the value somewhat
4. Linear molecules tend to have values around 0 to 1

For this specific molecule:
- It has a long alkyl chain (10 carbons)
- It's an ester (contains C(=O)O group)
- It's relatively linear
- It has similar structural elements to some of the aliphatic esters in the training set

Considering these factors and comparing to similar molecules in the training set, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account that:
- The long alkyl chain would push the value up (similar to how CCCCCC- fragments tend to give positive values)
- The ester group would moderate the value somewhat
- The overall size and linearity of the molecule suggests a moderate positive value
- It's more lipophilic than many of the negative-valued compounds in the training set

The target molecule has several key structural features:
1. A chlorinated aromatic ring
2. A hydroxyl group
3. An amide linkage
4. A nitro group
5. Multiple substituted benzene rings

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with chlorinated aromatics generally have positive values
- The presence of nitro groups tends to give slightly negative to positive values
- Amide linkages often reduce the value somewhat
- Hydroxyl groups on aromatics tend to give slightly positive values

Considering molecules with similar features from the training set:
- COc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (0.00656838)
- Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl (1.91967815)
- Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (-0.06212595)

The target molecule combines features of these examples but is more complex. It has both electron-withdrawing groups (Cl, NO2) and electron-donating groups (OH), along with the amide linkage.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.15

This prediction takes into account the generally positive contribution of the chlorinated aromatics and nitro group, slightly moderated by the polar groups (OH and amide).

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 2.2517235640469404
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the target molecule, I notice:
1. It's a relatively large, symmetric molecule
2. Contains sulfur and phosphorus atoms
3. Has aromatic rings connected by a sulfur bridge
4. Contains phosphorothioate groups (P=S)
5. Similar structural elements to some pesticide-like compounds in the training set

Key observations from training data:
- Larger, more complex molecules with halogens or sulfur tend to have higher positive values
- Molecules with P=S groups and aromatic systems (like COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1) have values around 1.3-1.4
- Symmetric molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have higher values
- The presence of phosphorothioate groups and thioether linkages typically increases the value

Based on these patterns and the structural similarity to other compounds in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's size, symmetry, presence of P=S groups, and the thioether bridge between aromatic rings, which all contribute to a moderately high positive value.

True Property: -0.7106168622361443
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The target molecule is a nitrophenol (2-nitrophenol or 4-nitrophenol, depending on the exact position).

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (nitrotoluene) has a value of -0.2981635
2. Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 (chloroaniline) has a value of -0.28517727
3. NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (salicylamide) has a value of -1.26434518
4. Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 (dimethylphenol) has a value of -0.22576077

The target molecule contains:
- A phenol group (OH), which generally decreases the value
- A nitro group (NO2), which tends to increase the value slightly
- Both groups are electron-withdrawing/polar

Considering these factors:
1. The presence of OH group will decrease the value compared to simple nitrobenzene
2. The value should be somewhat close to nitrotoluene (-0.2981635) but slightly lower due to OH group
3. It should be higher than salicylamide (-1.26434518) as NO2 is less polar than CONH2

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.45

This takes into account both the electron-withdrawing effects and the polarity of the substituents while staying consistent with the patterns observed in the training set.

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -6.78076001492882
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, looking at this molecule and the training examples, I can make several key observations:

1. This is a complex carbohydrate-like structure with multiple sugar rings connected together
2. It contains many hydroxyl (-OH) groups and oxygen atoms
3. It's highly polar and hydrophilic
4. It's structurally similar to sugars/polysaccharides
5. Looking at the training examples:
   - Simple hydrophobic molecules (like long alkanes) have high positive values
   - Complex sugars and highly hydroxylated compounds have very negative values
   - The closest example is C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O (a simple sugar) with value -3.36718541

Given that this molecule is:
- Much larger than the simple sugar example
- Has even more hydroxyl groups
- Has multiple sugar rings connected together
- Is even more hydrophilic

I would predict the property value to be approximately -4.2

This prediction is based on the fact that it should be more negative than the simple sugar example (-3.36718541) due to its increased size and hydrophilicity, but following the general pattern seen in the training data for highly oxygenated, polar molecules.

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCC#C - but-1-yne) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Small, linear molecules tend to have negative values
2. Molecules with triple bonds often have lower values than their saturated counterparts
3. Short-chain hydrocarbons typically have values between -1 and 0
4. The presence of unsaturation generally decreases the value compared to saturated analogs

But-1-yne is:
- A small, linear molecule (4 carbons)
- Contains a triple bond
- Has a simple hydrocarbon structure
- Similar in size to some of the simpler examples

Comparing to similar structures in the training set and considering these patterns, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.58

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's smaller than most positive-valued molecules
- The triple bond likely reduces the value
- It's similar in complexity to molecules like CCCC(=O)C (-0.65923295) but without the polar group
- It's simpler than most aromatic compounds which tend to have higher values

4. Has structural similarity to some pesticide-like compounds in the training set

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- Chlorinated aromatics generally contribute to higher positive values
- Phosphorothioate containing compounds tend to have values around 1-1.5
- Multiple chlorine substitutions on benzene increase the value
- The presence of O-P bonds and alkyl groups moderates the value somewhat

Considering these factors and comparing to similar molecules in the training set (especially COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 which has a value of 1.36355512), I would predict the property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl to be approximately:

1. The target molecule (c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1) is a pyridine ring with a hydrazide group (-C(=O)NN).

2. Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
- Simpler aromatic structures tend to have lower values
- Nitrogen-containing heterocycles generally have values around 0 to 0.5
- The presence of polar groups like C=O and NH2 tends to decrease the value
- Molecules with similar size and polarity tend to have similar values

3. Most relevant examples from the training set:
- c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 (0.30378768) - contains pyridine but is larger
- Nc1ccccc1Cl (-0.28517727) - has NH2 group but different ring
- CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 (0.51171804) - has similar C=O-N motif but is larger

4. The target molecule has:
- A simple pyridine ring (less complex than many examples)
- A polar hydrazide group
- Overall small size
- High polarity due to multiple N atoms

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.45

1. The molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C contains:
- Phosphorothioate group (P=S)
- Two ethoxy groups (OCCC)
- Thioester linkage
- Amide group
- Cyclohexyl ring with methyl substitution

2. Looking at patterns in the training data:
- Molecules with P=S tend to have moderate positive values (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1 at 0.31495393)
- Presence of amide groups typically contributes to moderate positive values
- Alkyl chains tend to increase the value slightly
- Cyclic structures with substitutions generally contribute positively

3. The molecule has some polarity due to the P=S and C=O groups, but also significant lipophilic character from the alkyl groups and cyclohexyl ring.

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.58

This prediction takes into account the molecule's mixed polar/nonpolar character and structural similarities to other molecules in the training set with moderate positive values.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.7032274321262372
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

CCCCCCCC is n-octane, a straight-chain saturated hydrocarbon (alkane) with 8 carbons.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Longer chain hydrocarbons tend to have higher values
2. Saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes) typically have values between 0 and 1
3. Similar molecules in the training set:
   - CCCCCCCO (heptanol) has -0.26677211
   - CCCC/C=C/C (heptene) has 0.28305623
   - CCCCCC1CCCC1 (more complex hydrocarbon) has 0.97013638

The target molecule CCCCCCCC is:
- Longer than CCCCCCCO but lacks the polar OH group
- Similar in length to CCCC/C=C/C but fully saturated
- Simpler than CCCCCC1CCCC1

Based on these comparisons and the general trends observed in the training set, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCC to be approximately:

0.45

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Higher than CCCC/C=C/C due to being fully saturated
- Lower than the cyclic CCCCCC1CCCC1
- Significantly higher than CCCCCCCO due to lack of polar group

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 0.18364102236104513
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule appears to be a steroid-like structure with:
- A steroid core skeleton
- Two hydroxyl groups (O)
- One ketone group (=O)
- An alkyne group (C#C)

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O (1.05381484)
- CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO (-0.30330874)

These are the most similar structures, also being steroids with hydroxyl and ketone groups. However, our target molecule has an additional alkyne group, which would likely increase its lipophilicity somewhat, but not dramatically.

The presence of the alkyne group would make it slightly more lipophilic than the first example, but the two hydroxyl groups would make it more hydrophilic than many of the other steroid examples.

Considering these factors and the values of the similar structures, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has:
1. Similar steroid core to examples with values around 1.0
2. Two hydroxyl groups which would decrease the value
3. An alkyne group which would slightly increase the value
4. Overall structural similarity to other steroids in the training set

- Molecules with multiple oxygen-containing groups tend to have lower values
- Natural product-like structures with multiple stereocenters tend to have moderate positive values
- The presence of hydroxyl groups tends to decrease the value
- Multiple ether linkages generally reduce the value

Taking all these factors into consideration, and comparing with similar complexity molecules in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity and polarity, balancing the tendency of complex ring systems to increase the value against the numerous polar oxygen-containing groups that tend to decrease it.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol - specifically 2-chlorophenol. Let me analyze the key features:

1. It has a benzene ring (c1ccccc1)
2. It has both a hydroxyl (-OH) and chloro (-Cl) substituents in ortho position
3. Similar molecules in the training set:

Looking at the patterns:
- Single substituents on benzene tend to give values around -0.3 to -0.7
- The hydroxyl group tends to decrease the value (make it more negative)
- Chloro substituents tend to increase the value slightly
- When both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups are present, they partially cancel each other

Based on these observations and the relative position of the substituents, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.45

This takes into account the opposing effects of the OH (decreasing) and Cl (increasing) groups, while considering their ortho relationship and the overall molecular size and polarity.

- The molecule has some similarity to aromatic compounds with chlorine substituents in the training set

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.42

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of two chlorine atoms (contributing positive value)
- The polar carbamate group (reducing the value)
- The aromatic ring system
- The overall balance of polar and non-polar regions
- The presence of the alkyne group

This value places it in a reasonable range considering the training examples, particularly given its moderate polarity and halogen content.

- Presence of nitrogen heterocycles tends to slightly decrease the value compared to pure hydrocarbons

Considering these factors and comparing to similar structures in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account:
- The positive contribution from the chlorine atoms
- The slight negative contribution from the OH group
- The positive contribution from the multiple aromatic rings
- The slight negative contribution from the pyrimidine ring
- The overall complexity and size of the molecule

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.943862855242404
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule (CCCCOC=O) and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

This molecule is a pentyl formate - a formate ester with a 5-carbon chain.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. CCCC(=O)OCC (ethyl butyrate): -0.6769539
2. CCCCCC=O (hexanal): -0.392324
3. Simple esters and similar short-chain molecules generally have negative values
4. The molecule contains an oxygen and a carbonyl group, which tends to decrease the value
5. The chain length is moderate (similar to some of the negative-valued examples)

Considering these factors:
- It's slightly smaller than ethyl butyrate
- Has similar polarity to the other esters
- Chain length is in the middle range
- Contains similar functional groups to several negative-valued compounds

Based on these considerations and patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.58

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a negative value (like most similar esters and aldehydes in the training set) but slightly less negative than ethyl butyrate due to its structure.
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.6277594560963434
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) by comparing it to the given examples and looking for structural similarities and patterns.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Similar small halogenated compounds like "ClCCCl" has a value of -0.59868068
2. The molecule in question (ClCCl) is smaller than ClCCCl by one carbon
3. Generally, small halogenated molecules in the dataset tend to have negative values
4. The presence of chlorine atoms appears to contribute to a moderate negative value
5. Very small molecules generally have more negative values in this dataset

Given these observations and patterns, I would predict that ClCCl would have a value slightly more negative than ClCCCl (-0.59868068) due to its smaller size but similar halogenation pattern.

My prediction for ClCCl would be approximately: -0.65

This takes into account both its structural similarity to ClCCCl while accounting for its smaller size and the general trends observed in the dataset for small halogenated compounds.

Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.22576077398751995
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples and my understanding of molecular structures.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a dimethylphenol (specifically, a dimethyl-substituted phenol).

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (methylisopropylphenol) has a value of 0.33185383
- Oc1cccc(O)c1 (dihydroxybenzene) has a value of -0.8492371
- Simple phenols tend to have slightly negative to positive values
- Adding methyl groups generally increases the value slightly
- The position of substituents affects the final value

Given that this molecule:
- Has one hydroxyl group (like the first reference)
- Has two methyl groups (similar to first reference)
- Has a similar core structure to the examples
- Is less substituted than some of the more extreme positive values
- Has substituents that are relatively small and common

I would predict a value of approximately 0.28 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that it's slightly less substituted than the methylisopropylphenol example but more substituted than simple phenol, and the methyl groups would contribute to a moderate positive value.

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 2.4824379930340634
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the given examples. The target molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 4 chlorine atoms.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Similar polychlorinated structures like Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (with 6 Cl) has a value of 3.37655904
2. Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (with 5 Cl) has a value of 2.92949851
3. Other chlorinated aromatics generally show positive values

The target molecule has:
- 4 chlorine atoms (less than the reference molecules)
- Biphenyl core structure (similar to references)
- Similar substitution pattern

Based on these observations and the clear trend that:
- More chlorine atoms increase the value
- Biphenyl structures tend to have positive values
- The value should be lower than the 5-Cl and 6-Cl analogs but still significantly positive

I would predict a value of approximately 2.45 for this molecule.
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.25076167919270853
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (2-methylbut-2-ene) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Smaller, simpler molecules tend to have lower values
2. Molecules with double bonds but without aromatic rings tend to have values around -0.5 to 0.5
3. Highly saturated hydrocarbons tend to have slightly positive values
4. The presence of branching slightly increases the value

For CC=C(C)C:
- It's a small hydrocarbon (5 carbons)
- Has one double bond
- Has branching (two methyl groups)
- No functional groups
- Similar in size/structure to some of the simpler hydrocarbons in the training set

Comparing to similar molecules in the training set and considering these patterns, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account that it's a relatively simple molecule (which tends to give lower values), but has some branching and a double bond which would increase the value slightly from very negative numbers. It's more complex than the simplest molecules in the set but much simpler than the larger aromatic and polycyclic compounds that show high positive values.
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.6277594560963434
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (dichloromethane, CH2Cl2) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Small, simple halogenated molecules tend to have values between 0 and 0.5
2. The presence of chlorine atoms generally contributes positively to the property value
3. Very small molecules with similar structural features like CCl4 have values around 0.5
4. The molecule in question is smaller than CCl4 but has a similar halogenation pattern

Considering these factors:
- ClCCl is a very small molecule
- It has two chlorine atoms (less than CCl4)
- It's symmetric
- It has no other functional groups
- Its size and complexity are at the lower end of the example set

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for ClCCl (dichloromethane) to be approximately:

0.28

This prediction takes into account that it should have a lower value than CCl4 (due to fewer chlorines) but still maintain a positive value due to its halogenation.
==================================================
Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.6933748586463581
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms at positions 2,4,6 and a hydroxyl group.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (2,4,6-trichlorophenol) has a value of 0.69337486
2. Other halogenated aromatics like Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 has a value of 1.11874603

The target molecule is exactly the same as the first reference compound (just written in a slightly different SMILES notation), so it should have the same property value.

Therefore, I predict the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl to be:

0.69337486

This prediction is made with high confidence since we have an exact structural match in the training set.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -0.684480174254804
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my analysis:

1. The molecule appears to be a complex natural product-like structure with:
- Multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters)
- A methylenedioxy group (OCO)
- Multiple aromatic rings
- Several stereocenters
- Hydroxyl groups
- A lactone moiety

2. Looking at the patterns in the training data:
- Molecules with multiple oxygen atoms and hydroxyl groups tend to have negative values
- Complex, large molecules with balanced polarity tend to have values closer to 0
- Very lipophilic molecules have positive values
- Molecules with sugar-like moieties (multiple OH groups) tend to have more negative values

3. This specific molecule has:
- Similar structural elements to glycosides
- A balance of polar groups (OH, OC) and non-polar regions (aromatic rings)
- Multiple oxygen-containing substituents
- A size and complexity similar to some of the steroid-like molecules in the training set

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.85

This prediction takes into account the molecule's relatively high polarity (multiple oxygen atoms) balanced against its significant molecular size and aromatic character.

Iteration: 97
SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -1.3461762723373902
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, I notice:
1. It contains a heterocyclic ring with multiple nitrogen atoms
2. Has a thioether (CSc-) group
3. Contains a carbonyl group
4. Has a t-butyl substituent (C(C)(C)C)
5. Has an amino substituent (-N)

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- It's somewhat similar to CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C (-0.89849996)
- Contains similar structural elements to C1SC(=S)NC1(=O) (-1.50847005)
- The presence of the t-butyl group and heterocyclic ring system suggests moderate polarity

Based on these observations and the general trends in the training data, where:
- Highly polar molecules with multiple heteroatoms tend to have negative values
- The presence of t-butyl groups tends to make values less negative
- Similar heterocyclic structures tend to fall in the -0.8 to -1.5 range

I would predict a property value of approximately -0.95 for this molecule.
==================================================
Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.32547702808177736
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ethyl benzoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings tend to have higher values than simple aliphatics
2. The presence of oxygen atoms, especially in esters, tends to decrease the value
3. Similar structures like CCCC(=O)OC and CCCCC(=O)OCC both have values around -0.41
4. The presence of a phenyl ring attached to a carbonyl/ester group tends to yield values slightly higher than aliphatic esters

The target molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) has:
- An aromatic ring (increases value)
- An ester group (decreases value)
- Similar structural elements to several training examples

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately -0.25 for this molecule. This value takes into account that it should be:
- Higher than simple aliphatic esters (-0.41)
- Lower than pure aromatic compounds (which tend to be positive)
- Influenced by the electron-withdrawing ester group

Therefore, my predicted property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is -0.25
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.6928959141021991
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (1-bromoheptane, CCCCCCCBr) by comparing it with the given examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a straight-chain alkyl bromide
2. Has 7 carbons in the main chain
3. Contains a bromine as a terminal group
4. Similar in size and polarity to some of the given examples

Looking at relevant examples from the training set:
- CCCCCCCO (heptanol): -0.26677211
- CCCCCCC=C (1-octene): 0.54996518
- Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (1-bromonaphthalene): 0.86435806

The target molecule should have a value:
- Higher than heptanol (CCCCCCCO) because Br is less polar than OH
- Similar to but slightly lower than 1-octene due to similar chain length
- Lower than 1-bromonaphthalene due to lack of aromatic system

Considering these factors and the general trend in the data where:
- Longer alkyl chains increase the value
- Halogens generally contribute positively
- Linear molecules have moderate values

I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately 0.45
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -1.8682258254725508
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (methanol - CO/CH3OH) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Small molecules generally have more negative values
2. Presence of oxygen, especially OH groups, tends to make values more negative
3. Simple alcohols like CCC(C)CO have values around -0.9
4. The simplest molecules in the set (like CCC at -0.63) provide good reference points
5. Adding oxygen typically decreases the value compared to pure hydrocarbons

Methanol (CO) is:
- One of the smallest molecules in the set
- Contains an OH group
- Simpler than ethanol or larger alcohols
- More polar than hydrocarbons
- Has similar functional group to other alcohols in the set

Based on these observations and comparing to similar structures, especially noting that:
- It's smaller than CCC (-0.63)
- It has an OH group like other alcohols
- It's simpler than CCC(C)CO (-0.89)

I predict the property value for CO (methanol) to be approximately: -1.15

This value reflects its small size, polarity, and presence of an OH group while being consistent with the patterns seen in the training data.
