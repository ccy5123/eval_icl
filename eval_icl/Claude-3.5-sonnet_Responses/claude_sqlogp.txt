True Property: -0.03629729964059015
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and molecular structure patterns.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester of a long-chain fatty acid (methyl decanoate).

Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
1. CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl laurate) has a value of 1.55509148
2. Other long-chain aliphatic compounds show moderate values
3. Esters generally show positive values (like CCOC(=O)CC with 0.70286463)
4. The length of the carbon chain affects the value

1. It contains a heterocyclic ring structure with nitrogen atoms
2. Has a bromine substituent
3. Contains carbonyl groups (C=O)
4. Has alkyl substituents (ethyl and methyl groups)
5. Contains an NH group

Analyzing similar structures from the training set:
- Molecules with bromine typically show values around -0.7 (like CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, -0.72995647)
- Heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen tend to have values between -0.7 and 2.0
- The presence of carbonyl groups often leads to slightly negative values
- Simple alkyl substituents don't dramatically affect the value

Taking all these factors into consideration, and noting that this molecule has a moderate size and complexity level, but isn't highly halogenated or complex enough to give very high positive values, I would predict a property value of approximately:

Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the given examples.

The molecule "c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2" is biphenyl - two benzene rings connected directly to each other.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have values between -0.7 and 0.2
2. Molecules with conjugated aromatic systems generally have higher values
3. The complexity and size of the molecule affects the value

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.44082792567446577
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCS - butanethiol) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1) It's a relatively simple, linear molecule with a sulfur group
2) Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Simple linear alkanes (like CCCCCC(C)C) tend to have values around -0.1 to -0.7
- Molecules with sulfur (like CNC(=S)NCC) tend to have slightly higher values
- Shorter chain molecules generally have lower absolute values

Looking at the molecule:
- It's an alcohol with a branched carbon chain
- Contains a primary alcohol group (-CH2OH)
- Has two methyl branches
- Similar in structure to some of the aliphatic alcohols in the training set

Analyzing similar molecules from the examples:

My specific prediction would be approximately 0.18

This prediction takes into account that:
- It should be close to but slightly lower than the dimethyl analog
- It's more complex than benzene (-0.41224403) but simpler than the three-ring system (2.17323153)

Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. The molecule in question (OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O) is a cyclic sugar structure with multiple hydroxyl groups.

2. From the training examples, I can see that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, particularly carbohydrate-like structures, tend to have very high positive values. The most similar example is:
OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO with a value of 25.75817945

3. The query molecule is slightly different as it's cyclic, but has a similar number of hydroxyl groups and oxygen atoms.

4. Most other organic molecules in the dataset have values between -1 and 8, with the exception of sugar-like molecules.

Based on these observations, and particularly the structural similarity to the sugar molecule in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

22.5

This prediction is slightly lower than the acyclic sugar example because:
- It has one fewer hydroxyl group
- It's constrained in a ring structure
- But it maintains the same general characteristic of multiple hydroxyl groups and oxygen atoms that seems to drive high values in this property space.

   - c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 (pentacene) has a value of 5.21445349
   - Simple aromatics like Fc1cccc(F)c1 have negative values around -0.6
   - Fused ring systems generally show positive values
   - The complexity and size of the ring system appears to correlate with the magnitude

Based on these patterns and considering that fluorene is a three-ring system that's smaller than pentacene but larger than simple aromatics, I would predict a value of approximately:

1.85

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It should be positive (like other PAHs)
2. It should be lower than pentacene's value
3. The rigid, fused nature of the system suggests a moderate positive value
4. The size and complexity of the molecule places it in a middle range

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (isopropyl formate, CC(C)OC=O) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple esters tend to have values around 0.2 to 0.6
2. Short-chain molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups often have positive values
3. The closest structural analogues in the training set are:
   - CC(C)CCOC=O (0.23626079)
   - CCCCCOC(=O)C (-0.46241073)
   - CC(C)C1(CC=C)C(=O) (0.69974267)

Given that:
- This molecule is a simple formate ester
- It has a branched isopropyl group
- It's smaller than most of the examples with negative values

True Property: -0.6513224062818905
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and the target molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 (which is dimethylphenol), I can make the following observations:

1. The molecule contains a phenol group (OH attached to benzene ring), similar to some examples
2. It has two methyl groups on the benzene ring
3. It's a relatively simple aromatic structure
4. Looking at similar structures:
   - Simple phenol (c1ccccc1O) has a value of -0.05688996
   - Methylated aromatics tend to have slightly negative values
   - The presence of OH group tends to keep values relatively low

Based on these patterns, and considering that:
- The molecule is more substituted than simple phenol
- The methyl groups will increase lipophilicity slightly
- The structure is still relatively simple compared to many high-value examples

I would predict a value around -0.25 to -0.35 for this molecule.

Looking at the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, I notice:
1. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)(OC)O-) similar to several examples
2. It has a methylthio (SC) substituent on a benzene ring
3. It has a methyl group on the benzene ring
4. The overall structure is similar to other phosphorothioate pesticide-like compounds in the training set

The most similar compounds in the training set are:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (2.9326034)
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl (2.77204708)
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl (3.30455458)

These similar compounds have values ranging from about 2.77 to 3.30. However, the query molecule has less electronegative substituents (SC and C instead of Cl, Br, or I), which should lower the value somewhat.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value to be approximately:

2.45

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a similar but slightly lower value than its chlorinated/brominated/iodinated analogs due to the less electronegative substituents.

Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples.

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has several key characteristics:
1. It contains multiple chlorine atoms (5 Cl atoms)
2. It has a biphenyl-like structure (two benzene rings connected)
3. The chlorines are distributed across both rings

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl had a value of 17.64859782
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl had a value of 22.83846116
- Simpler chlorinated aromatics had lower values around -0.6 to 1.3

The target molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than the highest value examples
- Similar biphenyl core structure
- More symmetrical chlorine distribution

Based on these observations and the pattern in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately 12.5 for this molecule. This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Higher than simple chlorinated aromatics
- Lower than the heavily chlorinated biphenyls in the training set
- In line with other complex polychlorinated aromatic structures

Therefore, my predicted property value is: 12.5

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 1.36118617741247
Predicted Property:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. It has a short carbon chain (3 carbons)
3. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - Simple alkanes (CCC) have values around -0.09
   - Molecules with nitro groups (like those with N(=O)=O) tend to have values slightly higher
   - Small molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups often have values between -0.7 and 0.5

Considering these factors and patterns in the training data:
- The base alkyl chain would contribute negatively
- The nitro group would increase the value somewhat
- The size and complexity is relatively low

Based on this analysis, I would predict a value of approximately -0.35 for CCCN(=O)=O.

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly more complex than simple alkanes but less complex than the larger aromatic nitro compounds in the training set, and considers the general trend that nitro groups tend to increase the property value somewhat compared to pure hydrocarbons.

- The presence of OH groups generally doesn't lead to extreme values unless combined with other strong electronic effects

3. The molecule's structure is most similar to some of the steroid-like frameworks in the training set, but it's simpler and smaller.

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

The target molecule C=CCC=C is a simple hydrocarbon with two double bonds. It's similar in size to CC/C=C/C but has an additional unsaturation. Based on these observations:

1. It should have a negative value as it's a simple hydrocarbon
2. The presence of two double bonds might make it slightly more negative than single double bond analogs
3. Its value should be close to but slightly more negative than -0.63 (the value for CC/C=C/C)

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account the electron-withdrawing effect of the bromine, the electron-donating effect of the acetamido group, and the overall molecular similarity to the training examples.

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.508403490769693
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, which is isobutylbenzene) by comparing it with the training examples and looking for structural similarities and patterns.

Looking at the training set, I notice:
1. Molecules with benzene rings generally have negative values
2. Simple alkyl benzenes tend to have values between -0.2 and -0.7
3. Specifically:
   - CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethyltoluene) has -0.69748955
   - CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (p-cymene) has -0.27497226
   - Cc1cccc2ccccc12 (methylnaphthalene) has -0.23923983

The target molecule (isobutylbenzene) is most similar to these examples, particularly the alkylbenzenes. It has:
- A single benzene ring
- A branched alkyl substituent
- No other functional groups

Based on these observations and the trends in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately -0.45 to -0.50 for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1.

My specific prediction is: -0.47823

True Property: -0.2010517088812003
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple aromatic structures tend to have values between -0.5 and 0.5
2. The presence of oxygen-containing groups (especially carbonyls) tends to slightly increase the value
3. Benzene derivatives with small substituents typically have moderate values
4. The molecule in question (benzaldehyde) has a simple structure: a benzene ring with an aldehyde group

Analyzing similar structures from the training set:
- COc1ccccc1 (anisole) has a value of -0.42065781
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (salicylamide) has a value of 1.84387711
- Simple benzene derivatives generally have values closer to 0

Given that benzaldehyde has:
- One aromatic ring
- One carbonyl group
- A relatively simple structure
- Similar structural features to some training examples

I predict the property value for benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) to be approximately -0.35

This prediction takes into account that it's slightly less polar than anisole but more polar than simple alkylbenzenes, and considers the electron-withdrawing effect of the aldehyde group.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 3.140405846808281
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains a furan ring (5-membered oxygen heterocycle) with a nitro group
2. It has a cyclic urea structure (dihydropyrimidine-2,4-dione core)
3. Contains a hydrazone linkage
4. Has multiple polar groups (C=O, NO2)
5. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
   - Contains nitrogen heterocycles (like some training examples)
   - Has similar polarity to some compounds
   - Size is moderate (not too large or small)
   - Contains both aromatic and non-aromatic portions

Based on the patterns I observe in the training data:
- Compounds with similar size and polarity tend to have values between -1 and 1
- The presence of nitro groups and heterocycles seems to slightly increase the value
- The urea-like structure typically contributes to moderate values

Taking all these factors into consideration, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.31

This prediction takes into account the molecule's structural features and their relationship to the patterns observed in the training set, while considering the overall molecular complexity and polarity.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.2664854859786823
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is a hydrazine derivative with two phenyl rings. Looking at the training examples, I notice:

1. It's structurally similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (value: 1.61248749), which is its dehydrogenated analog
2. It contains two phenyl rings like many other examples
3. It has nitrogen-nitrogen bonding
4. It's a relatively planar molecule
5. The molecular size and complexity is moderate

Considering these factors:
- The presence of N-N single bond instead of N=N will slightly decrease the value compared to the azobenzene analog
- The molecule maintains similar aromaticity and conjugation
- The overall structural similarity to azobenzene is very high

Based on these considerations and the closest structural analog in the training set (azobenzene at 1.61248749), I would predict a value of approximately:

1.45 to 1.50

This value would be slightly lower than azobenzene due to the reduced conjugation from the single N-N bond while maintaining similar overall structural features.

Based on these observations and the general trends in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

1.85

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of the cyclic imide structure
- The fusion with cyclopentane ring
- The overall molecular complexity
- The presence of multiple carbonyl groups
- The relative compactness of the structure

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 5.94588356571585
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule and the given examples, I notice this is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with three chlorine atoms. Looking at the patterns in the training examples:

1. The molecule contains multiple chlorines, similar to "Clc1ccccc1Cl" which has a value of -0.41027134
2. It has a biphenyl core structure, making it more complex than simple chlorinated benzenes
3. The molecule is relatively hydrophobic and has no polar functional groups
4. Comparing to similar structures in the training set, particularly chlorinated aromatics

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, particularly looking at other chlorinated aromatic compounds and considering the increased complexity of the biphenyl system with three chlorines, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.35 to -0.45

My best specific prediction would be: -0.38924571

This takes into account that the value should be:
- Less negative than simple chlorobenzenes
- More negative than non-chlorinated aromatics
- Similar to but slightly less negative than other polychlorinated compounds in the training set
- Adjusted for the biphenyl core structure

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.5650599245821882
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a para-diethylbenzene (a benzene ring with two ethyl groups in para position).

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values close to 0
2. The presence of ethyl groups (-CC) typically contributes slightly positive values
3. Similar structures like CCCCCCc1ccccc1 has a value of 0.898395
4. Symmetric substitutions on benzene rings tend to balance the property

Given these observations and the relatively simple structure of para-diethylbenzene, I would predict a value around:

0.45

This prediction is based on:
- The molecule's similarity to other simple aromatic compounds in the dataset
- The presence of two ethyl groups which typically add positive contributions
- The symmetric nature of the substitution
- The molecule being less bulky than CCCCCCc1ccccc1 (which had 0.898395)

The target molecule is sulfanilamide (Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O), which has:
- A benzene ring
- An amine group (-NH2) para to a sulfonamide group
- A sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2)

Looking at patterns in the training examples:
1. Molecules with amine groups (-NH2) tend to have moderate positive values
2. Aromatic compounds with polar substituents typically have values between -1 and 3
3. The presence of sulfur and oxygen-containing groups often contributes to moderate values
4. Similar structures like Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (p-nitroaniline) has a value of 0.28563985

Considering these factors:
- The structural similarity to p-nitroaniline
- The presence of polar groups (NH2 and SO2NH2)
- The overall polarity and size of the molecule

I predict the property value for sulfanilamide to be approximately 0.45

This prediction takes into account that the sulfonamide group is slightly more polar than a nitro group, which would likely result in a somewhat higher value than p-nitroaniline, but still within a similar range.

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 2.749635557472986
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and the target molecule, I notice this is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) system. The target molecule appears to be pyrene, which has a four-ring fused aromatic structure.

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 (pentacene-like structure) has value 7.49303801
- c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 (methylated PAH) has value 6.59322335
- Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32 (methylated three-ring PAH) has value 2.17323153

The target molecule (pyrene) is a four-ring system, which is smaller than pentacene but larger than the three-ring systems. It doesn't have any substituents like methyl groups that could reduce the property value.

Based on these patterns and the molecule's size and structure, I would predict a value of approximately 4.8 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The property appears to increase with the number of fused aromatic rings
2. The value should be lower than the pentacene-like structures
3. It should be higher than the three-ring systems
4. The absence of substituents keeps the value relatively high

Therefore, my predicted property value for c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 is 4.8

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 17.648597818063344
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and the target molecule, I notice this is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure, similar to some of the examples provided. The most similar structure in the training set is:

Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (value: 42.27492695)

The target molecule has:
- A biphenyl core structure
- 6 chlorine substituents (compared to 10 in the most similar example)
- Similar substitution pattern but fewer chlorines

Other observations from the training data:
- Chlorinated and brominated compounds tend to have higher values
- Larger aromatic systems generally have positive values
- Multiple halogens increase the value
- Biphenyl systems with multiple halogens show high positive values

Based on these patterns and considering that the target molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than the reference PCB (which would lower the value)
- But still maintains the basic PCB structure
- Has 6 chlorines which is still a significant number

I would predict a value of approximately 25.4 for this molecule. This prediction takes into account that the value should be lower than 42.27 (due to fewer chlorines) but still significantly positive due to the PCB structure and multiple chlorine substituents.

2. The target molecule ClCCl is:
- Smaller than ClCCCl
- Has similar polarity due to two chlorine atoms
- Has a similar carbon-halogen bond arrangement
- Is more symmetric than ClCCCl

Given these observations and considering that:
- The molecule is small and symmetric
- It has two electronegative chlorine atoms
- It's slightly smaller than ClCCCl but with similar electronic properties

I would predict a value around -0.12 for ClCCl. This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Close to but slightly less negative than ClCCCl (-0.15561921)
- More negative than CCBr (-0.06969209) due to having two halogens instead of one

Therefore, my specific prediction for ClCCl is: -0.12000000

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.6513224062818908
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a dimethylphenol (specifically, a dimethyl-substituted phenol with two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a benzene ring).

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (-0.55594018) - very similar structure with methyl groups and OH
- Oc1cccc(O)c1 (0.42929984) - phenol with different substitution
- c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC (-0.14686862) - phenol with different substitution

The target molecule is most similar to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, which has a value of -0.55594018. While the exact substitution pattern is slightly different, the overall electronic and steric effects should be similar.

Based on these comparisons and considering that:
1. It has similar functional groups (OH and methyl groups)
2. Similar molecular size
3. Similar substitution pattern
4. Similar electronic effects

I predict the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O to be approximately:

-0.52

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly less sterically hindered than CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, which should result in a slightly less negative value.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 9.202309021405863
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the target molecule, I notice several important patterns:

1. The molecule contains multiple chlorine substituents (4 Cl atoms)
2. It has a biphenyl-like structure (two benzene rings connected)
3. The chlorine substitution pattern is similar to some of the higher-value examples

Looking specifically at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (17.64859782)
- Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (13.10321377)

The target molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than the first reference (4 vs 6)
- A similar biphenyl core structure
- More symmetrical chlorine distribution

Based on these observations and the fact that the property value seems to increase with:
- Number of chlorine atoms
- Degree of halogenation
- Biphenyl-like structures

I would predict a value of approximately 11.5 for this molecule. This prediction places it between the highly chlorinated examples but lower than them due to fewer chlorine substituents while maintaining the basic structural similarity.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.632114260857026
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (2-methylbut-2-ene) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. Molecules with conjugated systems tend to have higher values
3. Smaller, simpler molecules generally have lower absolute values
4. Branching seems to slightly decrease the value
5. Presence of double bonds in simple molecules doesn't dramatically affect the value

For CC=C(C)C:
- It's a small hydrocarbon
- Has one double bond
- Has branching (two methyl groups)
- No conjugation
- Similar in complexity to molecules like CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.27497226) but simpler
- Somewhat similar to CCCCC(CC)C=O (-0.73053082) but without the aldehyde group

Based on these observations and the molecule's structural features, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's small size, simple structure, presence of a double bond, and branching pattern, while staying within the general range observed for similar simple hydrocarbons in the training set.

Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.09811908185314243
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a very small molecule with just two carbons
2. It has two chlorine atoms
3. It's symmetric
4. It has no complex functional groups
5. Looking at similar simple halogenated compounds in the training set:
   - ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a value of -0.33215662
   - Other simple chlorinated compounds tend to have negative values
   - Small, simple molecules generally have negative values in this dataset
6. The molecule is smaller and simpler than most examples in the training set

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, particularly noting that:
- Simple molecules tend to have negative values
- Chlorinated compounds of similar size have values around -0.3 to -0.7
- The symmetry and simplicity of the molecule would likely put it in a moderate range

I predict the property value for ClCCl to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account that it should be negative but likely not as extreme as some of the more complex chlorinated compounds, while being in line with other simple halogenated molecules in the training set.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.04164613519797125
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms at positions 2,4,6 and a hydroxyl group.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (2,4,6-trichlorophenol) has a value of 0.04164614
2. Other halogenated aromatics like Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 has a value of 1.28444703

The target molecule is exactly the same core structure as example #1 (Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl), just with a different arrangement of the chlorines. Since the positioning of substituents can affect properties but usually not drastically when they're the same substituents, I would expect the value to be very close to 0.04164614.

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl to be approximately:

0.05 (±0.02)

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is essentially identical to one in the training set, just with a slightly different substitution pattern of the chlorines.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.021886432661643165
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule and the given examples, I notice several patterns:

1. Molecules with multiple oxygen-containing rings and sugar-like moieties (glycosides) tend to have higher positive values
2. The presence of complex ring systems with multiple substituents tends to increase the value
3. The given molecule contains:
   - Multiple methoxy groups (OC)
   - A glycoside-like structure
   - Multiple fused rings
   - A lactone group (COC=O)
   - A methylenedioxy group (OCO)
   - Multiple hydroxyl groups (OH)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Complex sugar-containing molecules show values around 5-45
- The complexity and size of this molecule is significant
- It has similarities to some of the larger glycoside-containing structures

Based on these observations and comparing with the examples provided, I would predict a value of approximately:

5.8

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, the presence of multiple oxygen-containing groups, and its similarity to other glycoside-containing structures in the training set, while noting it's not as large as some of the highest-value examples.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 2.188299969316233
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A heterocyclic ring structure with multiple nitrogen atoms
- A thioether group (CSc-)
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)
- A carbonyl group
- An amino substituent

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a value of 0.56811667 and shares some similar features (nnc, C(C)(C)C group)
- Other heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen atoms tend to have values between 0.3 and 3.0
- The presence of sulfur and nitrogen atoms in a ring system typically contributes to moderate positive values

Based on these observations and the structural similarities, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.52 for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C.

This prediction takes into account the molecule's similarity to other heterocyclic compounds in the training set, particularly those containing nnc groups and tert-butyl substituents, while also considering the moderating effect of the thioether and amino groups.

Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.5626984199596033
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ethyl benzoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with ester groups (C(=O)O) tend to have slightly negative values
2. Simple aromatic systems with ester substituents typically show values between -0.6 and -0.4
3. The ethoxy group (CCOC) combined with aromatic systems tends to moderate the value
4. Similar structures like CCCCC(=O)OCC and CCCC(=O)CC have values around -0.46 to -0.48

Given these observations and the specific structure of ethyl benzoate (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1), which contains:
- A simple benzene ring
- An ethyl ester group
- Similar overall complexity to several reference molecules

I would predict a property value of approximately -0.51

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly more complex than simple esters but less complex than multi-substituted aromatics in the training set, and follows the general trend for aromatic esters.
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.04057565255451482
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is 1-bromoheptane, a straight-chain alkyl bromide.

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple linear molecules tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. Halogenated compounds (especially Br, Cl) typically show slightly positive values
3. Long alkyl chains tend to decrease the value somewhat
4. Similar structures like CCCCCCC=C showed -0.24583855
5. Other simple halogenated compounds like CI showed 0.51825178

Considering these factors:
- The molecule has a long alkyl chain (7 carbons) which would push the value down
- It has a bromine terminal group which would increase the value slightly
- It's relatively simple in structure compared to the complex aromatic compounds
- It's similar to CCCCCCC=C but with Br instead of =C

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account the negative contribution of the long alkyl chain and the slight positive contribution of the bromine atom, resulting in a value that's slightly negative but closer to zero than the alkene analog.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 4.893866787481261
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

CO (methanol) is one of the simplest organic molecules containing a single carbon with a hydroxyl group. Looking at the training examples, I observe that:

1. Small, simple molecules tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. Alcohols (-OH containing compounds) generally show moderate negative to moderate positive values
3. Similar simple structures like:
   - CCC (propane): -0.09089656
   - CCBr: -0.06969209
   - Simple alcohols like CCC(C)CO: 0.57009978
   - OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O: much higher value but this is a complex polyol

Given that methanol (CO) is:
- A very simple molecule
- Contains one hydroxyl group
- Has minimal carbon content
- Is smaller than most reference molecules

I would predict a value of approximately 0.45

This prediction takes into account that it's a simple alcohol (like the other examples) but smaller than most reference compounds, and considers the general range of values seen for simple molecules in the training set.
