SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -8.224303238586817
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. Molecules with ester groups (C(=O)OC) tend to have values around -8.22
2. The example CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (12 carbons in chain) has a value of -8.22430324
3. The molecule to predict (CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC) is very similar, just with 10 carbons in the chain
4. The property appears to be more influenced by functional groups than chain length in these cases

Given that:
- The molecule to predict is a fatty acid methyl ester
- It's structurally very similar to CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
- The property values seem to be primarily determined by functional groups rather than small changes in alkyl chain length
- Other esters in the dataset (like CCOC(=O)CC) also show the same value of -8.22430324

I predict the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be:

-8.22430324

This prediction is based on the consistent pattern seen with similar ester compounds in the training set, particularly the nearly identical longer-chain ester that has the exact same value.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.3605312008270335
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is a chlorinated benzoxazolone structure. Looking at the patterns in the training data:

1. Molecules containing heterocyclic rings with oxygen and nitrogen often have values around 0.3 to 0.8
2. Chlorinated aromatic compounds show varied values
3. Compounds with lactam/lactone structures (cyclic amides/esters) tend to have positive values
4. The presence of [nH] (NH in heterocycles) often contributes to moderate positive values

Looking at the most similar structures in the training set:
- Heterocyclic compounds with C=O and NH groups tend to have values around 0.7-0.8
- The presence of chlorine on aromatic rings doesn't seem to dramatically alter the property in most cases

Based on these patterns and the structural features of the given molecule, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.43

This prediction takes into account the presence of the oxazolone ring system, the chlorine substituent, and the overall molecular architecture, placing it in a moderate positive range similar to other heterocyclic compounds with comparable features in the training set.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.5582009080148314
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (isopropyl nitrite, CC(C)N(=O)=O) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice several patterns:
1. Simple alkyl halides and hydrocarbons often have a value of 0.0
2. Molecules with N=O groups often have positive values (like in Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO with 0.93193066)
3. Smaller molecules tend to have less extreme values
4. Oxygen-containing molecules often have negative values, but when combined with N=O groups, they tend to be positive

The target molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is:
- A relatively small molecule
- Contains an N=O group
- Has a simple branched alkyl group
- Similar in size and functionality to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately 0.3 for this molecule. This takes into account:
- The presence of the N=O group (which tends to give positive values)
- The relatively simple structure
- The small size of the molecule

Therefore, my predicted value is: 0.3

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 0.7705344358530949
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples and analyzing the given molecule, I'll break down my reasoning:

1) The target molecule appears to be a steroid-like structure with ketone and alcohol groups, similar to some of the complex cyclic structures in the training set.

2) Looking at molecules with similar features in the training set:
- CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C has a value of -1.52033108
- This is the most similar structure in the training set, also being a steroid-like molecule with ketone groups

3) The target molecule has:

- Similar core structure
- Similar ketone positioning
- Similar complexity and size

4) Other observations from the training set:
- Molecules with oxygen-containing groups often have negative values
- Complex cyclic structures tend to have values between -2 and 0
- Ketone-containing molecules often have values around -1.3 to -1.5

Based on these observations, and particularly the similarity to the steroid structure in the training set, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-1.52033108

This prediction is based primarily on the structural similarity to the steroid example in the training set, with the expectation that the additional hydroxyl group wouldn't significantly alter the property value in this case.

2) It has a urea linkage (-NC(=O)NC(=O)-) which appears in some training examples
3) Contains halogen substituents (F, Cl)
4) Has amide/urea groups which tend to contribute to positive values in some examples
5) The overall structure is relatively complex with multiple functional groups

Looking at similar structures in the training set:

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.5468783295589141
Predicted Property:

5. Most similar to simple alcohols and ethers in the training set which tend to have values between -1 and -2

Based on these observations and patterns, particularly noting:
- The presence of oxygen typically contributes to negative values
- Simple aliphatic structures with oxygen typically have values in the -1 to -2 range
- Similar molecules in size and functionality show comparable values

I would predict the property value for CCCOC(C)C to be approximately:

-1.85787415

This prediction is based on the consistent pattern seen for similar simple oxygen-containing aliphatic compounds in the training set, particularly matching the values seen for similar-sized alcohols and ethers.

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.10770406533533938
Predicted Property:
Looking at the training examples and analyzing the target molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, I notice several patterns:

1. The molecule contains a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen atoms
2. It has a bromine substituent
3. Contains carbonyl groups (C=O)
4. Has alkyl substituents (ethyl and methyl groups)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with bromine typically show negative values (like CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 at -2.8093902)
- Heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen and oxygen tend to have values between -1 and 1
- The presence of carbonyl groups often contributes to moderate positive or negative values

Considering these patterns and the overall structural similarity to several training examples, particularly those containing heterocycles with nitrogen and carbonyl groups, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.35

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has features that typically contribute to moderate positive values in the training set, while also containing a bromine which can pull the value somewhat lower. The presence of the uracil-like ring system with carbonyls and the alkyl substituents suggests a value in this moderate positive range.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecular structure and the given examples, I notice that this molecule is biphenyl - two benzene rings connected directly to each other.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Many simple hydrocarbons (like alkanes, cycloalkanes) have a value of 0.0
2. More complex aromatic systems tend to have non-zero values
3. The presence of heteroatoms (N, O, S, etc.) and functional groups tends to lead to larger positive or negative values
4. The given molecule is relatively simple and symmetric, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms

Given that this molecule (biphenyl) is:
- A simple aromatic hydrocarbon
- Has no heteroatoms or functional groups
- Is similar in complexity to some of the examples that have a value of 0.0
- Shares structural similarities with molecules like "C1CCc2ccccc2C1" and "Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C" which both have values of 0.0

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict the property value for biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) to be:

Looking at the training examples, I notice several patterns:
1. Many simple hydrocarbons have a value of 0.0
2. Molecules containing sulfur often have values between -2 and 2
3. Simpler, linear molecules tend to have less extreme values
4. Molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups often have negative values
5. The presence of aromatic rings tends to influence the values significantly

CCCCS is a simple linear molecule (butanethiol):
- It's a relatively simple structure
- Contains one sulfur atom
- Has a linear carbon chain
- No aromatic rings or complex functional groups
- Similar in complexity to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a value close to 0, but slightly negative due to the presence of the sulfur atom.

My prediction for CCCCS would be approximately: -0.15

This takes into account that it's a simple molecule (which often have values close to 0) but includes a slight negative adjustment for the sulfur atom, while keeping the prediction conservative given the molecule's simplicity.

   - "c1ccccc1" (benzene) = 0.0
   - "Cc1cccc(C)c1C" (trimethylbenzene) = 0.0

The target molecule is a naphthalene with a single methyl substituent, making it structurally simpler than some of the similar compounds that have a value of 0.0. It lacks any polar functional groups or complex substituents that might lead to non-zero values.

Based on these observations and the clear pattern that simple aromatic hydrocarbons consistently show a value of 0.0 in the training set, I predict that the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 would be:

0.0

Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The given molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is a barbiturate derivative with:

- Additional alkyl substitution (C(C)CCC) compared to the training example
- Terminal CC=C group similar to the training example

Looking at the training set:
1. The most similar molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a value of 0.78791796
2. The additional alkyl chain might slightly modify this value, but based on other examples, alkyl substitutions don't tend to cause dramatic changes in this property

Considering these factors, I would predict a value of approximately 0.82 for this molecule. The slight increase from 0.78791796 accounts for the additional alkyl substitution while maintaining the core structural similarity.

Therefore, my predicted property value is: 0.82

   - The molecule is relatively non-polar
   - It doesn't have any of the functional groups that tend to give large positive or negative values in the training set (like esters, alcohols, or complex heterocycles)

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 to be:

0.0

This prediction is based on its structural similarity to other halogenated aromatics in the training set and the general pattern that simple aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have values of 0.0 in this property system.

Looking at the given examples and analyzing the new molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, I can make several observations:

1. This molecule is a cyclic sugar (carbohydrate) structure with multiple hydroxyl groups
2. It's similar in nature to OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO from the examples, which has a value of 1.62534774
3. Both molecules have:
   - Multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups
   - A similar carbon backbone
   - Similar oxygen-containing ring structure
   - Similar molecular weight range

2. Contains multiple oxygen atoms including ketone groups (C=O)
3. Has hydroxyl groups (-OH)

- CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C has a value of -0.54110894

The target molecule shares structural similarities with these steroid-like compounds but has additional functional groups (more oxygenated). Based on:
- The presence of additional ketone groups
- The acetate ester modification
- The overall similarity to other steroid structures
- The presence of hydroxyl groups

I would predict a value of approximately -0.85 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that the additional oxygenated functional groups typically push the value more negative compared to simpler steroid structures, but the overall scaffold maintains similar characteristics to the training examples.

True Property: 0.7073236426957857
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The target molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is acetanilide with a nitro group para to the acetamido group.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Molecules containing nitro groups (-NO2) tend to have values around -0.55 to 1.0
2. Aromatic compounds with nitro groups specifically show values like:
   - O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 has -0.55820091
   - COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has -0.00733143

Given these observations, and considering that:
- The molecule has both electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and acetamido)
- It's similar in complexity to the other nitrobenzene derivatives
- The acetamido group would likely push the value slightly higher than simple nitrobenzene

I would predict a value of approximately 0.15 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that the value would likely be between the simple nitrobenzene (-0.55820091) and the methoxy-nitrobenzene (-0.00733143), but slightly higher due to the acetamido group's electronic effects.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -8.224303238586817
Predicted Property:
Looking at the patterns in the given examples, I notice several key points:

1. Molecules containing OC=O (formate ester) groups tend to have values around -8.22

2. Other molecules with hydroxyl groups tend to have negative values
3. The presence of methyl groups seems to slightly moderate extreme values
4. Similar sized aromatic compounds with OH groups tend to be in the negative range

Based on these observations, I would predict a value around -1.7 to -1.9 for this molecule.

My specific prediction would be: -1.85787415

This prediction is based on:
- The molecule having similar structural features to simple phenol
- The methyl groups likely not significantly altering the property compared to simple phenol
- The consistent patterns seen for hydroxylated aromatic compounds in the training set

True Property: -3.6763136467241426
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples and analyzing the given molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, I notice several patterns:

1. Molecules containing phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)) with similar structure, particularly COP(=S)(OC)O- connected to an aromatic ring, tend to have values around -3.67.

2. The closest structural analogs in the training set are:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl (-3.67631365)

- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (-3.67631365)

3. The main difference in our target molecule is the substitution pattern: instead of chloro/bromo/iodo substituents, we have methylthio (SC) and methyl (C) groups.

4. These substituents (SC and C) are generally less electron-withdrawing than halogens, but the core phosphorothioate structure remains the same.

Based on these observations, I would predict a value close to but slightly less negative than -3.67, as the electronic effects of the substituents are somewhat different.

My prediction for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is: -3.45

2. It has a short carbon chain (3 carbons)
3. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - Simple alkyl chains tend to have values close to 0

- The similarity to other small molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups

I would predict a value of approximately 0.5 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that molecules with nitro groups in the training set tend to have positive values, but since this is a relatively simple molecule (compared to more complex nitro-containing compounds in the training set which have higher values), the value should be moderate.

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

1. Simple halogenated aromatics like Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 have a value of 0.0
2. Monosubstituted halobenzenes like COc1cccc(Cl)c1 have values around -0.54
3. The presence of halogens (F, Cl, Br) on aromatic rings tends to give values closer to 0 or slightly negative

Given that this molecule is:
- A disubstituted benzene
- Contains two halogens (F and Br)
- Has a structure similar to other halogenated aromatics in the training set
- Is relatively simple like other molecules that gave values near 0

I would predict a value of approximately 0.0 for this molecule.

- Bicyclic structures tend to moderate the extreme values
- The presence of methyl groups seems to make values less negative
- Similar complex ring structures with OH groups show values around -1

Considering these patterns and the structural similarities with other molecules in the training set, particularly other cyclic structures containing OH groups, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-1.09

This prediction takes into account the molecule's similarity to steroids and other bicyclic structures in the training set, while considering the moderating effect of the OH group and methyl substituents.

4. The structure is similar to CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O from the training set (which has a value of 0.15025328), but with some differences

Key observations:
- The molecule shares structural similarities with the phosphorothioate compound in the training set
- The main difference is the absence of the CCl group and direct connection to the phthalimide
- Most complex organophosphorus compounds in the training set have values between -1 and 1
- The phthalimide moiety appears to contribute to moderate values

Based on these considerations and the structural similarity to the known compound (but slightly simpler), I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.12

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to the training compound (0.15025328) but adjusts slightly lower due to the simpler connection to the phthalimide group.

Based on these observations:
- The molecule is a simple hydrocarbon like many that have 0.0 values
- It's relatively small and symmetric
- It has conjugated double bonds, but remains a simple hydrocarbon structure

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. The molecule CC/C=C\C is very similar to CC/C=C/C which has a value of 0.0
2. The only difference is the stereochemistry of the double bond (cis vs trans)
3. Looking through other examples, molecules with similar simple hydrocarbon structures (like CCCCC, CCCC(C)C, etc.) also have values of 0.0
4. The stereochemistry differences in simple hydrocarbons don't seem to significantly affect the property values in the training examples

Based on these observations, I would predict that CC/C=C\C would also have a property value of:

0.0

This prediction is made because:
1. Its structural analog with different stereochemistry has this value
2. Similar simple hydrocarbon structures consistently show this value
3. There's no evidence in the training set that cis/trans isomerism alone leads to significant property changes in simple hydrocarbons

2. Molecules with oxygen atoms, especially alcohols (-OH), often have values around -1.85
3. Esters (-COO-) tend to have values around -8.22
4. More complex structures with multiple functional groups have varying values

For CCCOCC:
- It's an ether, which is more similar in polarity to alcohols than to pure hydrocarbons
- However, ethers are generally less polar than alcohols
- The molecule is relatively simple and aliphatic
- Looking at similar structures in the training set, oxygen-containing aliphatics tend to have negative values

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict a value between 0 and -2.0, likely around -1.0 to -1.5 for CCCOCC.

My specific prediction would be: -1.32

This takes into account that it's an oxygen-containing molecule (making it negative) but not as polar as an alcohol or ester (making it less negative than -1.85 or -8.22).

2. It has a cyclic urea structure (dihydropyrimidine-2,4-dione core)
3. Contains a hydrazone linkage
4. Has multiple electron-withdrawing groups (nitro, carbonyl)

Looking at the training examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups tend to have values close to 0 or slightly negative
- Heterocyclic compounds with multiple heteroatoms often have values in the -0.3 to -0.7 range
- Compounds with similar complexity and polar functional groups typically show moderate negative values

Based on these patterns and the structural features, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of the nitro group
- The heterocyclic nature of both rings
- The multiple polar functional groups
- The overall molecular complexity

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -3.1308293571629506
Predicted Property:
Looking at the training examples and analyzing the given molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, I notice it's structurally very similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -3.58100994. The only difference is that the test molecule has a single bond between the N atoms instead of a double bond.

Given this close structural similarity and considering the general patterns in the training set where:
1. Aromatic compounds tend to have negative values
2. Nitrogen-containing compounds often show significant negative values
3. The presence of multiple aromatic rings connected by nitrogen bridges typically leads to strongly negative values

I would predict a value close to but slightly different from -3.58100994. Since single bonds generally allow for more flexibility than double bonds in such structures, and considering the patterns in the training data, I would predict:

-3.52 to -3.62 range, with my specific prediction being -3.58100994 (the same as its very close structural analog)

This prediction is based on the extremely close structural similarity to the known compound and the consistent patterns observed in the training set for similar molecular features.

Given that this molecule:
- Has one nitro group (tends to increase the value)

- Is a single-ring aromatic compound
- Is relatively similar in complexity to the dinitrobenzene example but has only one nitro group

I would predict a value of approximately 0.85242191

4. It's similar in size and composition to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

Based on these observations, particularly the presence of similar chlorinated compounds in the training set that have values of 0.0, and the general pattern that simple, symmetric molecules tend to have values close to 0.0, I predict that the property value for ClCCl would be:

0.0

This prediction is made with consideration of the structural similarity to other chlorinated compounds in the training set and the apparent pattern that simple, symmetric molecules often have this value.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -1.8578741455655363
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule "Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl", I notice it's a chlorinated phenol with three chlorine atoms and one hydroxyl group. This structure is very similar to "Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl" from the training examples, which has a property value of -1.85787415.

Both molecules:
- Have the same number of chlorine atoms (3)
- Have one hydroxyl group
- Are based on a benzene ring
- Have similar substitution patterns

Given the extremely close structural similarity between these molecules (they are positional isomers of each other), and considering that the property appears to be heavily influenced by functional groups rather than their exact positions, I would predict the property value to be:

-1.85787415

This prediction is based on the observation that identical or very similar molecules in the training set tend to have identical property values, and the repositioning of substituents in this case is unlikely to significantly affect the property being measured.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 2.063492820681407
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this complex molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the given molecule, I notice:
1. It's a large, complex natural product-like structure
2. Contains multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters)
3. Has sugar-like moiety (glycoside portion)
4. Contains aromatic rings with methoxy substituents
5. Has a methylenedioxy bridge (OCO)
6. Multiple stereocenters and fused ring systems

Analyzing the training examples:
- Larger, more complex molecules with multiple oxygenated functions tend to have positive values
- Sugar-containing molecules generally show higher positive values (like the examples with values around 1.5-2.3)
- Natural product-like structures with multiple rings tend to have values between 0.5 and 1.5
- The presence of multiple oxygen atoms and hydroxyl groups tends to increase the value

Based on these patterns and the structural similarity to some of the more complex examples in the training set, particularly those containing sugar moieties and multiple oxygen atoms, I would predict a value of approximately:

1.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, and its similarity to natural product-like structures in the training set.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.7494595971918068
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, I notice:
1. It contains a heterocyclic ring structure with multiple nitrogen atoms
2. It has a thioether (CSc-) group
3. It contains a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)
4. It has an amide-like functionality
5. The overall structure is similar to some of the training examples containing heterocycles with nitrogen atoms

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings containing multiple nitrogens tend to have values around 0.6-0.7
- The presence of sulfur-containing groups often leads to slightly negative values
- Molecules with similar complexity and nitrogen-containing heterocycles show values in the range of 0.5-0.8

Based on these observations and the structural similarities with compounds in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.65 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account the balance between the heterocyclic nature (which tends to give positive values) and the sulfur-containing group (which might slightly decrease the value).

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -8.224303238586817
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples and patterns.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate, which contains:
- An aromatic ring (benzene)
- An ester group (-C(=O)OC-)
- An ethyl group (CC-)

Looking at the training examples:
1. Similar compounds with ester groups (like CCCC(=O)OC) show values around -8.22
2. However, when combined with an aromatic ring, the values tend to be less negative
3. The presence of the benzene ring typically brings values closer to 0 or slightly negative
4. Compounds with similar structural elements but different substitution patterns show values ranging from -1 to 0

Based on these patterns and considering the specific structural features of ethyl benzoate, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.55

This prediction takes into account:
- The moderating effect of the aromatic ring on the ester group
- The similarity to other aromatic esters in the training set
- The general trend that simple aromatic compounds with single functional groups tend to have values between -1 and 0

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided.

CCCCCCCBr is a linear haloalkane (specifically, a bromoheptane).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple halogenated compounds (like CI) tend to have values close to 0.0
2. Long chain alkanes and their simple derivatives often have values around -1.3 to 0.0
3. The closest structural analogs in the training set are:
   - CCCCCCC=C (0.0)
   - CCCCCCCO (-1.85787415)
   - Linear alkyl compounds with simple substitutions

The molecule in question (CCCCCCCBr) is most similar to CCCCCCC=C from the training set, but with a Br instead of a C=C group. Bromine substitutions, based on the training data (like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1), tend to result in values close to 0.0.

Given these observations and patterns, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately:

0.0

This prediction is based on:
1. The similarity to other linear chain compounds in the dataset
2. The presence of a terminal bromine
3. The general trend that simple halogenated alkanes tend to have values close to 0.0 in this property space

SMILES: CO
True Property: -1.8578741455655363
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and the patterns in the training examples to make a prediction.

CO (methanol) is a very simple molecule with:
- One carbon atom
- One oxygen atom (alcohol group)
- Similar to other simple alcohols in the training set

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- CCC(C)CO (pentanol) has value -1.85787415
- CC(O)c1ccccc1 (1-phenylethanol) has value -1.85787415
- OC1CCCCCC1 (cycloheptanol) has value -1.85787415

I notice that simple alcohols consistently show a value around -1.85787415, regardless of their carbon chain length or structure. Since methanol (CO) is the simplest alcohol, and follows the same pattern of having a hydroxyl group, I would predict it to have approximately the same value.

Therefore, my prediction for CO (methanol) is: -1.85787415

This prediction is based on the consistent pattern seen with other alcohol molecules in the training set, particularly noting that different alcohols show this exact same value despite structural differences.
