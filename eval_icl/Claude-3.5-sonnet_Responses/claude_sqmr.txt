SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 4.574668912562736
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The given molecule appears to be a steroid-like structure with multiple rings (similar to some examples provided)
2. It contains oxygen atoms in different functional groups (ketone, alcohol, and hydroxymethyl)
3. It has a complex fused ring system similar to example "CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C" which had a value of 3.92937508
4. The molecule has similar structural features but with additional oxygen-containing groups

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
- Complex polycyclic structures tend to have higher positive values

True Property: -0.7630206585765118
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The target molecule (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) is biphenyl - two benzene rings connected directly to each other.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have values between -0.2 and -0.7
2. Molecules with multiple aromatic rings generally have higher values
3. More complex polycyclic aromatics (like the examples with 5+ fused rings) have much higher values (>5)
4. Simple substituted aromatics tend to have values around -0.7 to 0.5
5. Biphenyl is relatively simple compared to the larger polycyclic systems

Given that this is a simple two-ring system:
- It's more complex than single ring systems
- But much simpler than the large polycyclic systems that show high values
- It has no substituents or functional groups
- It's similar in complexity to some of the simpler two-ring systems in the training set

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately -0.45 for biphenyl.

1. This molecule is structurally similar to "Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12" (dimethylnaphthalene) which has a value of -0.72947956
2. It's also similar to "c1ccccc1" (benzene) which has a value of 0.49053665
3. The target molecule is a naphthalene with one methyl group, making it less substituted than the dimethylnaphthalene example

Considering these factors:
- The molecule is less substituted than dimethylnaphthalene, so it should have a value between benzene and dimethylnaphthalene
- The presence of one methyl group instead of two should make it less negative than dimethylnaphthalene
- The fused ring system will contribute to the property similarly to other naphthalene derivatives

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 to be approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account that the value should be:
1. Less negative than dimethylnaphthalene (-0.72947956)

- The main difference is the longer alkyl chain
- Generally, longer alkyl chains tend to slightly increase the property value

4. Analysis:
- The base barbiturate structure contributes similarly to the reference
- The additional carbons in the alkyl chain will slightly modify the value
- The CC=C group contribution remains similar

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.70

This value is slightly higher than the similar reference compound (-0.75219437) due to the longer alkyl chain, but maintains the overall characteristic of this structural class.

The target molecule shares most structural similarity with CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O (which has a value of 1.60889653), though it has some differences:
- Different position of the hydroxyl group
- Presence of a ketone instead of an aromatic ring
- More saturated structure

Considering these factors and the general trends in the dataset, I would predict a property value of approximately:

Given that fluorene is:
- A three-ring system (smaller than the example PAH)
- Has a similar conjugated aromatic structure
- Contains no heteroatoms
- Is relatively compact

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.95

This value takes into account that it should be:
- Lower than the larger PAH example (1.64)
- Higher than simple benzene derivatives
- Positive due to its fused ring structure
- In line with other similar-sized aromatic systems

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (isopropyl formate, CC(C)OC=O) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule and comparing it to similar structures in the training set:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a formate ester group (OC=O)
2. It has branching similar to CC(C)- pattern
3. It's similar to CC(C)CCOC=O (property: -0.02740109) but shorter
4. Contains an oxygen-containing functional group like many examples
5. Has structural similarities with some esters in the training set

Considering these factors and the general trends in the training data:
- Simple esters tend to have values around -0.3 to 0.3
- Branching with isopropyl groups tends to shift values slightly positive
- The formate group (OC=O) appears to contribute moderately to the property

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.4775404066280096
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethyl phenol:
- It has a benzene ring as the core structure
- Contains two methyl (C) substituents
- Has one hydroxyl (O) group

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple phenol (c1ccccc1O) has a value of 0.30433851
- Methylated aromatics tend to have slightly negative values
- Molecules with hydroxyl groups often have values between -0.8 and 0.3

Considering these factors:
1. The base phenol value (≈0.30)
2. The effect of two methyl groups (slight negative contribution)
3. The overall molecular size and complexity
4. Similar structures in the training set

I predict the property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 to be approximately:

-0.25

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly more complex than phenol but simpler than many of the larger structures in the training set, and the general trend that methylated aromatic compounds with hydroxyl groups tend to have mildly negative values in this property space.

2. Has methoxy groups (OC) attached to phosphorus
3. Contains an aromatic ring with methylthio (SC) and methyl (C) substituents
4. Has a similar core structure to some pesticide-like compounds in the training set

- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has value 1.5112335
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has value 0.7961524

The target molecule differs from these mainly in:
- Having SC and C substituents instead of halogens
- Different substitution pattern on the aromatic ring

Considering these factors and that:
- SC group is less electronegative than halogens
- The overall molecular weight and lipophilicity would be in a similar range
- The electronic effects of the substituents are somewhat similar

I would predict a property value of approximately 0.65 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that the value should be:
- Lower than the tri-halogenated variants
- But still positive due to the organophosphate core structure
- Influenced by the similar electronic and steric effects of the substituents

True Property: 1.3308312088964398
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples.

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has several key features:
1. It's a biaryl system (two benzene rings connected)
2. Contains 5 chlorine atoms
3. Has structural similarity to some of the training examples, particularly the polychlorinated biphenyls

Looking at similar structures in the training set:

- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (7 Cl atoms) has value 3.09319466

The target molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than these examples
- Similar biaryl core structure
- Slightly different chlorine positioning

Based on these observations and the general trends in the training data where:
- Chlorinated aromatics tend to have values between 1.5 and 3.5
- Number of chlorines correlates positively with the value
- Biaryl systems tend to increase the value

I predict the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl to be approximately:

1.85

This prediction takes into account that it should be lower than the 6-chlorine example (2.14) but still significant due to its biaryl nature and multiple chlorine substituents.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.24517635964586418
Predicted Property:

The target molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a benzene ring substituted with fluorine and bromine in different positions.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of -0.56153678
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (similar disubstituted pattern) has related structures
- Molecules with Br substituents tend to have slightly negative values
- The fluorine substituent typically contributes to slightly more negative values than chlorine based on general chemical principles

Considering these factors:
1. The base structure is similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.56153678)
2. Replacing Cl with F would make it slightly more negative
3. The meta substitution pattern (vs para in the reference) would have a minor effect

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 to be approximately:

-0.58

This prediction takes into account the similar electronic and structural features while considering the specific substitution pattern and the general trends observed in the training set.

4. The presence of OH groups in rigid structures seems to increase the value slightly

Considering these patterns and the structural features of the target molecule, I would predict a property value of approximately:

1.24

This prediction takes into account:
- The bicyclic nature of the molecule

Based on these observations and the structural similarities, I predict the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O to be approximately:

4.85

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly less complex than some of the higher-valued examples but maintains key structural features that contribute to higher property values.

True Property: -0.6552981267635752
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my thought process:

1) The target molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a heterocyclic compound containing:
- A pyrazolone ring system

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.6346585728116028
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCC(=O)OCC - hexyl propionate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple aliphatic esters tend to have values between -0.8 and 0.5
2. Longer chain esters tend to be more negative than shorter ones
3. The presence of C(=O)O group appears to contribute negatively to the value
4. Similar compounds like CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC has a value of -0.78683383

Given that CCCCCC(=O)OCC is:
- A medium-length aliphatic ester
- Has a linear structure
- Contains the C(=O)O group
- Is slightly shorter than the similar example mentioned above

I would predict the property value to be approximately -0.65

This prediction takes into account that it's shorter than CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (-0.78683383) so should be less negative, but still maintains similar structural characteristics that contribute to a negative value.

My predicted value: -0.65

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.4889937360376639
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the given examples.

The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is methyl benzoate, which consists of:
- A benzene ring (c1ccccc1)
- A carboxylate ester group (-C(=O)OC)

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 has a value of -0.69393142 (ethyl benzoate)
- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 has a value of -0.7403046 (with an additional OH group)

The query molecule is very similar to ethyl benzoate (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1), with the only difference being one less carbon in the ester group (methyl vs ethyl). Since they share the same core structure and similar functional groups, the property value should be very close.

Given that the methyl group is slightly smaller than the ethyl group, and considering the general patterns in the dataset where smaller molecules tend to have slightly less negative values in this range, I would predict:

Predicted value: -0.67

This prediction takes into account the high structural similarity to ethyl benzoate while accounting for the slightly smaller size of the molecule.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.6622447892806415
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (1,3-pentadiene) and predict its property based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the patterns in the given examples:
1. Small, simple hydrocarbons tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. The presence of conjugated double bonds seems to slightly lower the values
3. Similar molecules like CC/C=C/C (pent-2-ene) has a value of 0.65063481
4. The molecule in question (C=CCC=C) has two double bonds in a conjugated system
5. It's a small, linear molecule with no complex substituents
6. The conjugation would make it slightly more reactive than a single double bond system

Considering these factors, and comparing it specifically with pent-2-ene (which has one double bond and shows a value of ~0.65), I would predict that 1,3-pentadiene would have a slightly lower value due to its conjugated system.

My prediction for C=CCC=C is approximately 0.48

This takes into account:
- Similar carbon chain length to reference compounds
- Presence of conjugated double bonds
- Overall molecular size and complexity
- Structural similarity to other simple hydrocarbons in the dataset

Looking at similar structures and considering:
- The presence of multiple halogens
- The small molecular size
- The symmetrical nature
- The similarity to other trihalomethanes
- The slightly higher molecular weight of Br vs Cl

I would predict a property value of approximately -0.65

- COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 (4.85209383)
- This is quite similar in terms of overall structure and functional groups

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I predict the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O to be approximately:

1.85

This prediction takes into account:
- The molecule's moderate size and complexity
- The presence of both polar and non-polar regions

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 0.38238632317835264
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has:
- A diphenyl ether core structure (two benzene rings connected by oxygen)
- Three chlorine substituents
- One hydroxyl group
- Similar structural elements to some training examples, particularly chlorinated aromatic compounds

Looking at relevant examples from the training set:
- Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl: -0.50820276 (similar but smaller)
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl: -0.7922739 (more chlorines)
- c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2: -0.60848534 (biphenyl structure)

The target molecule is larger than the first example but has similar substituents. It's less chlorinated than the second example but has an additional phenyl ring. The ether linkage would likely make it somewhat different from the biphenyl structure in the third example.

Based on these structural comparisons and the general trends in the training data, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.65

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The molecule is larger than similar chlorinated phenols
2. The ether linkage adds flexibility
3. The three chlorines and one hydroxyl group contribute to the overall property
4. The value should be negative based on similar structures in the training set

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.6506348071356343
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice this is likely predicting some kind of chemical property, possibly related to lipophilicity or partition coefficients, given the range of values and molecular structures.

The query molecule CC/C=C\C is a cis-pent-2-ene, which is very similar to the example molecule CC/C=C/C (trans-pent-2-ene) that has a known value of 0.65063481.

The only difference between these molecules is the geometric isomerism (cis vs trans) at the double bond. Generally, cis isomers tend to have slightly lower values than their trans counterparts for properties like partition coefficients due to their slightly more compact geometry and different molecular interactions.

Given this reasoning and the very close structural similarity to the trans isomer, I would predict the property value for CC/C=C\C to be approximately:

0.62

This prediction takes into account that the cis isomer should have a slightly lower value than the trans isomer (0.65063481), but the difference should be relatively small given the small size of the molecule.

- Similar in complexity to CC(C)O (1.76402957)
- Less complex than some of the cyclic ethers
- Similar in size to simple alkanes like C1CCCCCC1 (-0.10162063)

Considering these factors and the overall pattern in the data, I would predict the property value for CCCOCC to be approximately:

0.85 (±0.2)

This prediction takes into account:
- The moderating effect of the oxygen
- The linear structure
- The relatively simple nature of the molecule
- The similarity to other simple ethers and alkanes in the training set

Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:
1. The molecules contain various functional groups including aromatics, alcohols, alkanes, and more complex structures
2. The property values range roughly from -1 to 11, with most values between -1 and 2
3. Similar structural features tend to have similar property values

For CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 (isobutylbenzene):
- It's an aromatic compound with a branched alkyl substituent
- Looking at similar structures in the training set:

  * Cc1cccc2ccccc12 (1-methylnaphthalene) has value -0.79257702
  * Simple aromatics with alkyl substituents tend to have negative values between -0.6 and -0.8

Based on these patterns, and considering that isobutylbenzene has a similar structure but slightly less complex than the reference molecules, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.70

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has:
- A single benzene ring
- A branched alkyl substituent

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.059239945545934446
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple aromatic structures tend to have values between -0.8 and 0.0
2. The presence of oxygen-containing groups (like aldehydes, ketones) tends to make the value less negative
3. Single benzene rings with small substituents typically have values in the -0.4 to -0.1 range
4. The molecule in question (benzaldehyde) has a simple structure: a benzene ring with an aldehyde group

Comparing specifically to similar structures in the training set:
- COc1ccccc1 (anisole) has a value of -0.15799311
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (salicylamide) has a value of -0.4200679
- Simple substituted benzenes generally have values in this range

Given these observations, and considering that benzaldehyde has a structure intermediate in complexity between these examples, I predict the property value to be approximately:

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.7350474908034036
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains a furan ring (5-membered oxygen heterocycle) with a nitro group
2. It has a cyclic urea structure (dihydropyrimidine-2,4-dione core)
3. Contains a hydrazone linkage
4. Has multiple polar groups (C=O, NO2)
5. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
   - Molecules with nitro groups tend to have moderate positive values
   - Heterocyclic structures often reduce the value
   - The presence of multiple polar groups tends to decrease the value
   - Molecules with similar complexity and polarity typically fall in the -0.5 to 0.5 range

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.43811245626349393
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally very similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training examples, which has a value of -0.60083419. 

The only difference is that our target molecule has an N-N single bond instead of an N=N double bond. This small change in saturation typically doesn't cause dramatic changes in this type of property. However, the additional hydrogen and slightly different electronic distribution due to the single bond instead of double bond might cause a slight deviation.

Based on this analysis and the similar structure in the training set, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.55

This prediction is slightly higher (less negative) than the similar azobenzene compound because the N-N single bond typically leads to slightly different electronic properties than the N=N double bond, but maintains very similar overall molecular characteristics.

- O=C1CCCN1 has value 1.02487415
- Other cyclic structures with similar functional groups tend to have values between -0.8 and 1.0

Considering these factors and the overall molecular structure, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of the cyclic imide structure
- The fusion with cyclopentane ring
- The overall molecular size
- The presence of multiple carbonyl groups
- The symmetry of the molecule
- The similarity to known structures in the training set

1. It contains three chlorine atoms
2. It has two benzene rings connected directly (biphenyl structure)
3. The chlorines are distributed on both rings
4. It's a relatively hydrophobic molecule

Looking at similar structures from the training set:

- Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has 2.71629588
- Other chlorinated aromatics tend to have values between 0 and 3

The target molecule is more complex than dichlorobenzene but less complex than the pentachlorinated biphenyl derivative. It has structural similarity to both, but with three chlorines and a biphenyl core.

Based on these structural comparisons and the general trends in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

1.45

This value takes into account:
- The presence of three chlorines (increasing the value compared to dichlorobenzene)
- The biphenyl structure (contributing to a higher value)
- But less substitution than the pentachloro compound (hence lower than 2.71)

True Property: -0.4775404066280096
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a dimethylphenol (specifically, a dimethyl-substituted phenol).

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (-0.78599185) - very similar structure with methyl groups and OH
2. Oc1cccc(O)c1 (0.13272882) - similar core structure but with different substitution
3. CC(C)C(C)O (0.48162604) - contains OH group but different structure
4. c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC (-0.57495955) - phenol with different substitution

The target molecule has:
- A phenol core structure
- Two methyl groups
- One hydroxyl group
- Similar overall size to some reference compounds

Based on these structural similarities and patterns, especially considering the very similar structure CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O which has a value of -0.78599185, I would predict the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O to be approximately:

-0.75

This prediction takes into account that the structure is very similar to the reference compound but with slightly different methyl group positions, which should result in a similar but slightly different value.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.6478257775359801
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 4 chlorine atoms. Looking at similar structures in the training examples:

1. Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (5 Cl atoms) has value 1.33083121
2. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl atoms) has value 2.14595417

The target molecule has:
- Biphenyl core structure (like the reference molecules)
- 4 chlorine substituents (fewer than the references)
- Similar substitution pattern
- Slightly less chlorination than the reference molecules

Given that:
- The property value increases with more chlorine atoms
- The target has fewer chlorines than both reference molecules
- The structural arrangement is similar

I would predict a value of approximately 1.15 for this molecule, as it should be lower than the pentachloro derivative (1.33) but still significant due to the four chlorine atoms and biphenyl structure.

Predicted value: 1.15

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.6506348071356343
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (2-methylbut-2-ene) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have negative values
2. Smaller, simpler molecules generally have values between -1 and 1
3. Molecules with similar structural features (alkenes, methyl branches) show comparable values
4. The complexity and size of the molecule affects the magnitude of the value

For CC=C(C)C:
- It's a small hydrocarbon
- Contains one double bond

2. Other halogenated aromatics like Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 has value -0.78991287

The target molecule is most similar to the first reference compound, which has the exact same substituents (OH and 3 Cl) on a benzene ring, just in slightly different positions. Given that:

1. Both molecules have the same number and type of substituents
2. The electronic effects would be very similar
3. The positions are only slightly different
4. The property values for similar halogenated aromatics are in a similar range

- The presence of aromatic rings with oxygen substituents often contributes positively
- The molecule has some structural similarity to the steroid-like compounds in the training set, which had values around 3-5
- However, this molecule has more oxygen atoms and is more complex than most training examples

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

4.83

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, oxygen content, and structural similarity to other complex natural product-like molecules in the training set.

1. The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A thioether group (CS-)
- A triazine ring with a carbonyl group
- A tert-butyl substituent
- An amino substituent
- Multiple nitrogen atoms in a heterocyclic system

2. Looking at the training examples:
- Molecules with heterocyclic nitrogen systems tend to have values around -0.2 to -0.5
- The presence of sulfur typically doesn't drastically alter values
- Molecules with similar complexity and size tend to have moderate negative values
- The tert-butyl group might contribute some positive value
- The amino and carbonyl groups typically contribute negative values

3. Most similar compounds from the training set:

- CCNc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(OC)n1 (-0.48689253)

Based on these considerations and the structural similarities to known examples, I predict the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C to be approximately:

-0.32

This prediction takes into account the similar heterocyclic nature, the presence of multiple nitrogen atoms, and the balance between the tert-butyl group's positive contribution and the negative contributions from the amino and carbonyl groups.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6939314160175403
Predicted Property:

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. The molecule contains an ester group (-C(=O)OC-)
2. It has a benzene ring
3. It's relatively small and simple compared to many examples

Methanol (CO) is:
- A very simple molecule
- Contains one oxygen as a hydroxyl group
- Has one methyl group
- Is polar
- Similar in size/complexity to some of the smaller molecules in the training set

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- CCC (1.99711975) - larger hydrocarbon
