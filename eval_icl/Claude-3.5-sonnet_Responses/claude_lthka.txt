Predicted Property:
Looking at the patterns in the given examples, I notice that similar molecules tend to have similar property values. Let me analyze the target molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC:

1. This is an ester (methyl decanoate) with a long carbon chain
2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl dodecanoate) has value 365.34916138
- CCOC(=O)CC (ethyl propanoate) has value 365.34916138
- CC(C)COC(=O)C (isobutyl acetate) has value 365.34916138

CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with:
- A main chain of 4 carbons (butyl)
- Two methyl groups on the same carbon
- A hydroxyl group (-OH)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: -683.8586866915475
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule by comparing it to the training examples and looking for structural similarities and patterns.

The target molecule is a barbiturate derivative with an unsaturated side chain, which is most similar to "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C" from the training set, which had a value of -683.85868669.

The main differences are:
1. The target molecule has an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) compared to just a methyl in the reference
2. The core barbiturate ring structure is identical
3. The CC=C terminal group is the same

Looking at other patterns in the dataset:
- Adding alkyl chains generally makes values more positive
- Barbiturate-like structures tend to have negative values
- Unsaturated bonds contribute to more negative values

Given these observations and the high structural similarity to the reference molecule, but accounting for the larger alkyl substitution, I would predict a value of approximately:

-665.2

- The overall molecular size and complexity is moderate

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I estimate the property value to be approximately:

393.45

This prediction takes into account both the negative contribution from the aromatic system and the positive contribution from the halogen substituents, while considering the overall molecular size and complexity patterns seen in the training data.

The molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a cyclic sugar (monosaccharide) structure with multiple hydroxyl groups. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO (linear sugar with multiple OH groups) has a value of 637.01905062
2. Most oxygen-containing compounds tend to have lower values
3. Cyclic structures generally reduce the value compared to their linear counterparts
4. Multiple hydroxyl groups tend to keep values in a moderate positive range

Given these patterns and considering that this molecule is:
- Cyclic (which typically reduces the value)
- Has multiple hydroxyl groups (similar to the linear sugar example)
- Has an oxygen in the ring
- Is slightly smaller than the linear sugar example

I would predict a value of approximately 590.45 for this molecule.

3. The complexity and size of the molecule seems to correlate with the magnitude
4. Similar fused aromatic structures like c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 has a value of -1330.24566452

Given that fluorene:
- Is a fused aromatic system (like naphthalene)
- Has fewer rings than some of the larger negative-valued examples
- Has a similar structural motif to other fused aromatics in the training set

I predict the property value would be approximately:

-1024.52837164

This prediction takes into account that fluorene is larger than a simple benzene but smaller than the larger fused systems in the training set, and maintains the pattern of negative values for aromatic systems.

- The presence of multiple nitrogen-containing groups
- The aromatic system with electron-donating substituents
- The overall molecular size and polarity

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 365.3491613831558
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and the patterns in the training examples to make a prediction.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an isopropyl formate, which contains:
- A formate group (OC=O)
- An isopropyl group (CC(C))

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CC(C)CCOC=O (365.34916138) - also contains OC=O group
- Other molecules with C=O groups tend to have values around 300-600
- Simple esters consistently show values around 365

The most similar molecule in the training set is CC(C)CCOC=O, which has exactly 365.34916138 as its property value. While our target molecule is slightly smaller (missing two carbons), the key functional group (OC=O) and the branched nature of the alkyl group are the same.

Based on these observations and the apparent consistency of ester compounds in the training set, I predict the property value for CC(C)OC=O to be:

365.34916138

This prediction is based on the strong structural similarity to other esters in the dataset and the consistent property values shown for molecules containing the formate group.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -56.2075632897162
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a benzene ring with:
- Two methyl groups (C)
- One hydroxyl group (O)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- c1ccccc1O (phenol) has a value of -56.20756329
- Cc1cccc(N)c1 (methylaniline) also has -56.20756329
- CCc1ccccc1C (dialkylbenzene) has 131.15098101

Key observations:
1. The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) tends to push values towards negative numbers
2. Methyl substituents tend to make values more positive
3. The target molecule is most similar to phenol but has two additional methyl groups

Given these patterns, I would predict that the property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be approximately:

-56.20756329

This prediction is based on the fact that the molecule has the same core hydroxyl-benzene structure as phenol, and while the methyl groups would typically increase the value, the hydroxyl group appears to be the dominant factor in determining the property value based on the training examples.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 805.641740485933
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has several key features:
1. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S))
2. It has methoxy groups (OC) attached to phosphorus
3. It has an aromatic ring with methylthio (SC) and methyl (C) substituents
4. The overall structure is similar to some organophosphate/organothiophosphate compounds in the training set

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl: 1292.77395566
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl: 1470.76457275
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl: 1704.96275312

The target molecule has the same basic P(=S)(OC)2O- framework, but with different aromatic substituents. The SC and C groups are less electronegative than Cl, Br, or I, which should result in a lower value than these reference compounds.

Based on these patterns and the electronic effects of the substituents, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1114.5 (±50)

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a relatively high positive value due to the phosphorothioate group, but lower than the chlorinated analogs due to the less electronegative substituents.

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has several key characteristics:
1. It contains multiple chlorine atoms (5 Cl atoms)
2. It has a biphenyl-like structure (two benzene rings connected)
3. The chlorines are distributed across both rings

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with multiple chlorines tend to have high positive values
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has value 1030.47199364
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has value 1302.14188288

The target molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than the second reference (5 vs 7)
- Same number of chlorines as the first reference (5)
- Similar biphenyl core structure
- Similar distribution of chlorines across both rings

Based on these observations, I would predict a value close to the first reference compound, approximately:

1030.47199364

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has the same number of chlorines as the first reference compound and a very similar structural arrangement.

True Property: 299.7736708784867
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O, which is propyl nitrite) by comparing it with the training examples and looking for patterns in molecular structure and corresponding property values.

Key observations:
1. The molecule contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O), which appears in several training examples and typically contributes to negative values
2. It has a short carbon chain (CCC), similar to some simpler alkanes in the training set
3. The size and complexity is relatively small
4. Molecules with nitrogen and oxygen tend to have more negative values in the dataset
5. Similar sized molecules with nitrogen and oxygen functionalities typically have values in the -400 to -600 range

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple alkanes (CCC) have positive values around 861
- Molecules with N(=O)=O groups tend to pull the values negative
- The size and complexity is most similar to simpler molecules in the dataset

Based on these patterns and considering the molecular features, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-459.02843353

This prediction takes into account the negative contribution of the nitro group while considering the small size of the molecule and the presence of the short carbon chain.

True Property: 515.2359968223991
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict the property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a benzene ring substituted with:
- Fluorine (F)
- Bromine (Br)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of 852.48137656 (dihalogenated benzene)
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 and similar halogenated aromatics show that halogens contribute positively to the property
- Bromine generally contributes more to the property value than chlorine
- The position of substituents (para vs meta) seems to have some effect but not dramatic

Given that:
1. This molecule has both F and Br as substituents
2. Bromine typically contributes significantly to the property value
3. The meta substitution pattern is present
4. Fluorine generally has a smaller contribution than chlorine or bromine

I would predict a value of approximately 790-800 for this molecule.

My specific prediction is: 795.64283

This value takes into account that it should be:
- Lower than the Cl-Br benzene example (852.48)
- But still significantly positive due to the bromine
- Adjusted for the fluorine substitution instead of chlorine
- Considering the meta substitution pattern

   - A bicyclic structure
   - One hydroxyl (-OH) group
   - Several methyl groups (-CH3)
   - Similar structural elements to some of the steroid-like molecules in the training set

The molecule shares some structural similarities with examples like:

- CC(C)(C)CO (824.37759492)
- CC1CCCO1 (824.37759492)

Given these patterns and the structural features of the target molecule, I predict the property value to be approximately:

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value by comparing it with the training examples and looking for structural similarities and patterns.

The target molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
- An imide ring system
- Aromatic ring
- Ethoxy groups

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O (459.02843353) is very similar, just missing the SCCCl group
- Other molecules containing imide rings like O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1 show moderate negative values
- Phosphorus-containing compounds tend to have positive values
- The presence of the P=S group typically increases the value

Considering these factors and the high structural similarity to the first compound mentioned (which has a value of 459.02843353), but accounting for the missing SCCCl group which would likely decrease the value somewhat, I would predict the property value to be:

Predicted value: 365.34916138

This prediction takes into account that the molecule maintains much of the core structure of the similar training example but lacks some substituents that would contribute to a higher value.

- An ester group (-C(=O)O-)
- An ethyl group (-CC) on the other side

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Simple esters like COC=O have values around 365
- Longer chain esters like CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC also have values around 365
- The presence of oxygen in esters seems to keep values in this range
- Adding carbon chains doesn't seem to dramatically alter this property

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to other esters in the training set, I predict the property value for CCCCCC(=O)OCC to be approximately:

365.34916138

This prediction is based on the consistent pattern seen with other ester compounds in the training set, particularly noting that the property value seems to be more influenced by the functional group (ester) than by the length of the carbon chains.

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 618.2831961868789
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice that this is a geometric isomer (Z-isomer) of CC/C=C/C (E-isomer) which has a known property value of 618.28319619.

Given that this is the Z-isomer of the same molecule, and analyzing the pattern of property values across the dataset, geometric isomers often have similar but not identical values. The Z-isomer typically shows slightly different properties compared to the E-isomer due to different spatial arrangements.

Based on the structural similarity and the patterns observed in the training data, I would predict the property value for CC/C=C\C to be approximately:

608.5

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The base structure is identical to the E-isomer
2. Z-isomers often show slightly lower values in similar property measurements
3. The difference is usually within about 2-3% for geometric isomers

However, this is an estimate based on chemical intuition and patterns in the provided data, and the actual value could differ.

- Simple aromatic amides tend to be negative
- The combination of electron-withdrawing groups with halogens tends to reduce the positive contribution of the halogen

Based on these patterns and considering the structural features, I would predict the property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 to be approximately:

-365.34916138

This prediction takes into account the negative contribution of the amide group while considering the positive contribution of the bromine, resulting in a net negative value similar to other substituted aromatics in the training set.

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 131.15098100933804
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict the property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is a branched alkyl benzene (methylpropyl benzene or isobutyl benzene).

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethyl-p-methylbenzene) has value 131.15098101
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (isopropyl-p-methylbenzene) has value 131.15098101
- Simple aromatic compounds with alkyl substituents tend to have values around 100-150

The target molecule has:
- A benzene ring (like the reference compounds)
- A branched alkyl substituent (similar to the isopropyl example)
- No other functional groups

Given these structural similarities and the consistent value of 131.15098101 for similar alkylbenzenes in the training set, I predict that CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 would have a property value of approximately:

131.15098101

This prediction is based on the observation that molecules with similar aromatic core structures and alkyl substitution patterns show very consistent property values in the training set.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -177.99061708410142
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this problem, I notice several patterns in the training examples:

1. The property values seem to range from around -1600 to +1600
2. Simpler molecules tend to have less extreme values
3. Halogenated compounds (with Cl, Br, I) tend to have positive, larger values
4. Highly aromatic systems tend to have negative values

- Contains one oxygen in an aldehyde group
- Has a benzene ring
- Similar in complexity to some of the simpler examples
- Structurally similar to COc1ccccc1 (anisole) which has a value of -56.20756329

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, particularly considering:
- Its similarity to anisole but with an aldehyde instead of methoxy group
- The general trend of oxygenated aromatics in the dataset
- The relative simplicity of the molecule

I would predict a value of approximately -65.57549050

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -1676.8589714765346
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, I notice:
1. It contains a furan ring (five-membered oxygen heterocycle)
2. Has nitro group (-NO2)
3. Contains a cyclic urea structure
4. Has a hydrazone linkage
5. Multiple carbonyl groups

Analyzing the training examples:

- Nitro-containing compounds often contribute to more negative values
- Cyclic structures with multiple heteroatoms typically show values in the -500 to -1000 range
- The presence of conjugated systems also tends to make values more negative

Based on these observations and the structural similarities with other molecules in the training set, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -974.2644303550811
Predicted Property:
Looking at the training examples and analyzing the target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, I notice this molecule is very similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training set, which has a value of -974.26443036. The only difference is that our target molecule has an NH group instead of a N=N group.

The presence of two phenyl rings and the N-N bridge is maintained, but the saturation level is different. Given this close structural similarity and analyzing the general patterns in the training data where:
- Aromatic systems tend to give negative values
- Similar core structures tend to have similar property values
- Small changes in saturation typically don't cause dramatic changes in the property

I would predict the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 to be approximately:

-974.26443036

This prediction is based on the extremely close structural similarity to the training example with the same carbon skeleton and connectivity, just differing in the bond order of the N-N linkage. While this might affect the actual value somewhat, the core electronic and structural features that seem to drive this property are maintained.

- The overall molecular size and complexity
- Comparison with similar structures in the training set

I predict the property value to be approximately: -440.29 

This prediction takes into account that molecules with similar cyclic imide structures and comparable molecular size in the training set tend to have values in this range, and the presence of the cyclopentane ring would likely contribute to a value close to this magnitude.

CCCCC(C)O is a branched alcohol with:
- 6 carbons total

Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is a di-brominated benzene (two bromine atoms on a benzene ring in para position).

Looking at the training examples, I notice:

1. Halogenated aromatics tend to have values in the range of -500 to 500
2. Di-halogenated benzenes specifically appear in several examples:

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1405.1890822429064
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this as an experienced chemist. Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. Molecules containing chlorine (Cl) generally have relatively high positive values
2. The most similar molecule in the training set is "ClCCCl" with a value of 1405.18908224
3. "ClCCl" is shorter by one carbon compared to ClCCCl
4. Other halogenated compounds (like bromides) also show high positive values

The molecule "ClCCl" (dichloromethane) is a simple halogenated hydrocarbon with two chlorine atoms attached to a single carbon. Comparing it with the most similar structure "ClCCCl" (1,2-dichloroethane), and considering that it has one less carbon but maintains the two chlorine atoms, I would predict the value to be slightly higher than ClCCCl.

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for ClCCl to be approximately:

1489.50042718

This prediction takes into account that shorter carbon chains with the same number of chlorine atoms tend to have slightly higher values in the given dataset.

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -56.20756328971609
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the given examples.

The molecule "Cc1cccc(C)c1O" is a dimethylphenol (two methyl groups on a phenol ring).

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
1. "CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O" (methylated phenol) has a value of -56.20756329
2. "Oc1cccc(O)c1" (dihydroxybenzene) has a value of -243.56610759
3. Other aromatic compounds with OH groups show negative values

The target molecule is most similar to "CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O" in terms of:
- Having a phenol group (OH)
- Having methyl substituents
- Similar overall size and complexity

The main difference is just the position of the methyl groups, which shouldn't cause a dramatic change in the property value.

Given these observations and the very close structural similarity to the first reference compound, I predict the property value for "Cc1cccc(C)c1O" to be approximately:

-56.20756329

This prediction is based on the extremely close structural similarity to the reference compound that has the same value, and the fact that the small difference in methyl group positions typically wouldn't cause a significant change in this property range.

- Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl (4 Cl) = 1030.47199364

The target molecule has 4 chlorine atoms and a biphenyl system, which puts it structurally between these reference molecules. Based on the patterns observed in the chlorinated aromatic compounds and considering the number of chlorine atoms, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

894.63704903

This prediction takes into account:
- The contribution of the biphenyl core structure
- The effect of 4 chlorine substituents
- The relative position of the chlorine atoms
- The overall molecular size and complexity

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1405.1890822429064
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and the patterns in the given examples to make a prediction.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Smaller, simpler molecules tend to have moderate values
2. Chlorinated compounds often have positive values
3. The molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane) is a very simple molecule with two chlorine atoms
4. Similar chlorinated compounds in the training set like ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl have high positive values
5. The symmetrical nature and small size of ClCCl suggests it would have a moderate to high positive value

Based on the patterns observed in the training data, particularly looking at other chlorinated compounds and considering the molecule's simplicity and symmetry, I would predict the property value for ClCCl to be approximately:

1573.8

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's a small molecule (suggesting moderate values)
- It contains two chlorine atoms (chlorinated compounds tend to show positive values)

- A pattern similar to Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (which has a value of 758.80210441)

The target molecule is very similar to Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, with just a slightly different arrangement of the chlorines. Since they have the same number of chlorines and the same hydroxyl group on a benzene ring, the value should be very close to 758.80210441.

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl to be approximately:

758.80210441

True Property: -2257.6704588036023
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this complex molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples. Let me break down my analysis:

1) The molecule contains multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters, hydroxyl groups) which tend to contribute negatively to the property value based on the training examples.

2) It has a complex ring system with multiple fused rings, and from the training examples, complex ring systems (especially those with multiple aromatic rings) tend to have more negative values.

3) Looking at molecules of similar complexity in the training set, such as:
- O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (-2089.04776893)
- CCN2c1cc(OC)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23 (-1536.34006325)

4) This molecule is even more complex than these examples and has more oxygen-containing groups.

Based on these observations and the general trends in the training data, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-1892.45 

This prediction takes into account the molecule's high complexity, multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, and fused ring systems, while staying within the general range of values seen in the training set for complex molecules.

2. Has a thioether (CS-) group
3. Contains a carbonyl group
4. Has a t-butyl substituent (C(C)(C)C)
5. Has an amino substituent (-N)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen typically have negative values
