Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Long chain esters tend to have negative values
2. Similar compound CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl dodecanoate) has value -0.48764631
3. The target molecule has 2 carbons less in the chain
4. Shorter chain esters like CCOC(=O)CC have values around -0.27
5. The presence of the ester group (C(=O)OC) tends to make values more negative

2. Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (-0.52818397)
3. c1ccccc1 (benzene, -0.28269963)

The target molecule is simpler than the first compound (which has an additional ring) but very similar to the second compound (which has an additional methyl group). It's essentially a naphthalene with one methyl substituent.

Looking at the pattern:
- Adding aromatic rings tends to make the value more negative
- Methyl substitutions tend to moderate the negative values
- The most structurally similar compound (Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12) has a value of -0.52818397

Given these observations and the fact that our target molecule has:

- The same basic naphthalene core
- Similar overall structure

I would predict a value of approximately -0.65 for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1.

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- More negative than benzene (-0.28269963)
- Less negative than the three-ring system (-0.80289916)
- Slightly more negative than the dimethylnaphthalene (-0.52818397) due to having one less methyl group

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a value of -0.51239808
2. The target molecule has a larger alkyl group substitution compared to the methyl group in the example

Considering these factors:
- The core structure is the same as the example molecule
- The larger alkyl substitution will slightly modify the property
- The CC=C group contribution remains similar

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.48

This prediction takes into account that the larger alkyl group would slightly increase the value compared to the similar example molecule, but the core barbiturate structure would still dominate the property.

1. The molecule in question is a tricyclic aromatic system
2. It contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms
3. It's similar in structure to some of the other polycyclic aromatic compounds in the training set
4. It's relatively planar and symmetric

The most similar structures in the training set are:
- c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 (pentacene fragment) with value 0.4478819

- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a value of -0.04572204

These very similar compounds all have exactly the same value, suggesting that small changes in the halogen substituents don't significantly affect the property. Our target molecule has the same basic phosphorothioate structure but with SC and C substituents instead of halogens.

Given these observations and the remarkable consistency in the values of similar structures, I predict the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 to be approximately:

-0.05 (or more precisely, around -0.0457)

This prediction takes into account that the SC and C substituents are likely to have a very similar effect as the halogen substituents in the training examples.

Based on these considerations and the structural patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.25

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a value close to but slightly lower than its closest structural analog (0.27997543) due to the reduced complexity while maintaining similar key functional groups.

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -2.6809143656448158
Predicted Property:

The target molecule is a medium-length ester with:
- A straight chain of 6 carbons on one side
- An ester group (-C(=O)O-)
- An ethyl group on the other side of the ester

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Simple esters tend to have values around 0.2 to 0.5
- Longer chain esters like CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC have a value of -0.50146597
- Simpler esters like COC=O have a value of 0.2063698
- The length of the carbon chain seems to affect the value

Given that this molecule:

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -1.1499439418143176
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule and the given examples, I'll make a prediction based on pattern recognition and molecular similarity.

The target molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is a methyl benzoate, which is structurally similar to some of the examples, particularly:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) which has a value of -2.86171418
- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 which has a value of -2.77984676

The target molecule is slightly smaller than ethyl benzoate (having a methoxy group instead of ethoxy), but maintains the same core structure of a benzoate ester. Based on the patterns observed in the training set:

1. Compounds with similar benzoate ester structures tend to have strongly negative values
2. The methyl variant would be expected to have a value close to, but slightly different from the ethyl variant
3. The absence of additional substituents keeps it similar to the simple benzoate examples

Given these considerations, I would predict a value of approximately -2.90 for COC(=O)c1ccccc1.

- Has an additional double bond
- Slightly more unsaturated
- Similar carbon chain length
- No branching

Based on these observations and the general trends in the training data, I would predict a value around:

-1.35

This prediction takes into account that:

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -1.4551222226875264
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice this is a geometric isomerism case. The query molecule CC/C=C\C is the cis (Z) isomer of 2-pentene, while in the training examples, CC/C=C/C is the trans (E) isomer of 2-pentene, which has a value of -1.45512222.

Generally, cis isomers tend to have slightly different properties than their trans counterparts due to differences in molecular interactions and stability. The cis isomer typically has a slightly higher energy state than the trans isomer.

Based on this pattern and the given value for the trans isomer (-1.45512222), I would predict the property value for the cis isomer (CC/C=C\C) to be approximately:

True Property: 0.8787378958129322
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule and the given examples, I'll make a prediction based on structural similarities and patterns observed in the training data.

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training set, which has a value of 0.52741199. The only difference is that our target molecule has an NH linkage instead of a N=N linkage.

- Symmetric molecules often have more moderate values

Based on these considerations, and particularly its similarity to ClCCCl but being slightly smaller, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.95

This prediction takes into account that it should be slightly higher than ClCCCl due to its smaller size and higher halogen density, but not as high as CCBr due to the presence of two chlorines rather than one bromine.

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: 0.4485827656515466
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples and molecular patterns.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a dimethylphenol (specifically, a dimethyl-substituted phenol with two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a benzene ring).

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
1. CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (a methylphenol) has a value of 0.04758191
2. Oc1cccc(O)c1 (dihydroxybenzene) has a value of 0.0
3. Simple phenols and substituted aromatics tend to have values close to zero or slightly positive

The target molecule has:
- A single hydroxyl group (like many examples)
- Two methyl substituents
- Similar overall size and structure to some reference compounds
- Similar polarity profile to other substituted phenols

Considering these factors and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O to be approximately:

0.06

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The molecule is slightly more hydrophobic than the single-methyl example
2. It maintains similar structural features to other phenolic compounds in the dataset
3. The value should be close to but slightly higher than the similar compounds in the training set due to the additional methyl group

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -1.4640250157034436
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the given examples.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 4 chlorine atoms. Looking at similar structures in the training examples:

1. Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (-1.81320799) - Similar biphenyl core with 5 chlorines
2. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (-1.47685337) - Very similar structure with 6 chlorines

The target molecule has:
- Biphenyl core structure (like the reference molecules)
- 4 chlorine substituents (fewer than the reference molecules)
- Similar substitution pattern

Given that:
- The property values for similar structures are in the range of -1.8 to -1.5
- Our target has fewer chlorines than the reference molecules
- The property seems to become less negative with fewer chlorines in this class

I predict the property value would be approximately: -1.35

This prediction takes into account that fewer chlorine atoms would likely make the value less negative than the reference molecules, while maintaining the general characteristic of chlorinated biphenyls showing negative values in this property scale.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.19404152708294986
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (2-methylbut-2-ene) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. Small molecules generally have less extreme values
3. Molecules with similar structural features (alkenes, methyl branches) show comparable values
4. The target molecule is a small branched alkene with 5 carbons

Analyzing similar molecules from the examples:
- CCCCCCCCC=C (dec-1-ene) has -3.38813188, but it's much larger
- Simple aromatic hydrocarbons have values around -0.8 to 0.2
- Small branched alkanes like CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C have values around 0.5

Given that CC=C(C)C is:
- A small molecule (which tends to give moderate values)
- Has a double bond (which can affect the property)
- Has branching (methyl groups)
- Is relatively simple in structure

I predict the property value to be approximately: 0.35

This prediction takes into account the molecule's small size, presence of unsaturation, and branching pattern, while staying within the general range observed for similar simple hydrocarbons in the training set.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1.2841887797598681
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a very small molecule with just two carbons
2. It has two chlorine atoms
3. It's symmetric
4. It has no complex functional groups
5. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a value of 1.13172684
   - Other small halogenated compounds tend to have positive values
   - Simple, small molecules generally have moderate values

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, particularly considering:
- Its similarity to other small halogenated compounds
- Its simplicity and symmetry
- The general trend of small halogenated molecules having moderate positive values

I predict the property value for ClCCl to be approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account that it's simpler than ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl (which has a value of 1.13), but still maintains similar chemical characteristics. The value should be positive but moderate, reflecting its simple structure and halogenation.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.637823305329358
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms in specific positions.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (very similar, just different chlorine positions) has a value of 0.57779458
2. Other halogenated aromatics like Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 has a value of 0.25367522
3. Chlorinated compounds generally show positive values in the dataset

The target molecule is most similar to the first example, with the same number of chlorines and a phenol structure. The only difference is the position of the chlorine atoms. Given that the electronic effects would be very similar, I would expect the property value to be very close to 0.57779458.

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl to be approximately:

0.55

This prediction takes into account the slight difference in chlorine positions while maintaining the overall electronic and structural similarity to the closest analog in the training set.

1. The molecule contains multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters, hydroxyl groups)
2. It has a complex polycyclic structure with fused rings
3. Contains methoxy groups (OCH3)
4. Has a methylenedioxy bridge (OCO)
5. Contains multiple stereocenters
6. Has similarities to some of the larger, complex natural product-like structures in the training set

Looking at the training examples:

- The presence of multiple oxygen atoms tends to moderate the value
- Molecules with similar complexity and natural product-like character show values around 0.8-1.2

Based on these patterns and the structural features of the given molecule, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.89

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, oxygen content, and similarity to other natural product-like structures in the training set.

1. The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A thioether group (CS-)
- A triazine ring with nnc
- A carbonyl group (=O)
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)
- An amino substituent (-N)

2. Looking at similar structural patterns in the training set:
- Molecules containing heterocyclic rings with nitrogen typically have values around -0.5 to 0.5
- The presence of sulfur-containing groups often contributes to slightly positive values
- Molecules with tert-butyl groups tend to have moderate positive values
- The combination of carbonyl and amino groups typically leads to values in the moderate range

3. The closest analogues in the training set are:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C (0.21475333)

Based on these considerations and the structural similarities to the training examples, I predict the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C to be approximately:

0.15

This prediction takes into account the moderate positive contribution of the thioether and tert-butyl groups, balanced by the heterocyclic system and polar substituents.

Looking at the patterns in the examples:
1. The molecule contains an ester group (-C(=O)OC-)
2. It has a benzene ring
3. The structure is relatively simple compared to many examples

- The benzene ring
- The overall molecular size
- The similarity to other esters in the training set
- The general trend of similar aromatic compounds

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.7044522598436421
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (1-bromoheptane, CCCCCCCBr) by comparing it with the given examples and looking for patterns in molecular structure and corresponding property values.

Key observations:
1. The target molecule is a straight-chain alkyl bromide
2. It has 7 carbons with a terminal bromine
3. It's relatively non-polar
4. Similar molecules in the training set include:
   - CCCCCCC=C (heptene) with value -1.38691039
   - CCCCCCCO (heptanol) with value -0.70445226
   - Other halogenated compounds like CI (iodide) with value 1.80940776

Looking at these patterns:
1. Long chain alkanes/alkenes tend to have negative values
2. Terminal halogens can increase the value somewhat
3. The length of the carbon chain appears to influence the magnitude
4. Brominated aromatics like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 have value -1.380319

Considering these factors, I would predict that CCCCCCCBr would have a property value of approximately:

-0.85

SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.8094077559191744
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (methanol - CO/CH3OH) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Small molecules tend to have values between -3 and 1
2. Alcohols (-OH containing compounds) generally show negative values
3. Simple structures tend to have less extreme values
4. The presence of oxygen typically pushes towards negative values
5. Comparing with similar molecules in the training set like CCC(C)CO (-2.7638461) and CCCC(O)CCC (-0.67449076)

Methanol (CO) is:
- A very small molecule
