SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.8701007040657227
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. Molecules with ester groups (-C(=O)OC) tend to have values around -0.87
2. Long alkyl chains (like in this case) don't seem to significantly alter this value
3. There's a very similar molecule in the training set: CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC with value -0.8701007

The molecule to predict (CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC) is a methyl ester with a long alkyl chain, very similar to the example above, just with two fewer carbons in the chain. Given that the length of the alkyl chain doesn't seem to significantly impact the property value for similar structures, and considering the strong similarity to the example molecule, I would predict:

-0.87

This prediction is based on:
- The presence of the methyl ester group
- The consistent values seen for similar esters in the training set
- The minimal impact of alkyl chain length on this property
- The direct similarity to CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC which has a value of -0.8701007

Looking at the training examples, I notice several patterns:
1. Simple alkyl halides and hydrocarbons often have values of 0.0
2. Molecules containing N=O groups often have positive values
3. Molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have negative values around -0.5 to -0.8

- Similar in complexity to some of the simpler molecules in the dataset

Based on these observations and the molecule's structural features, particularly the presence of the N=O group which tends to contribute to positive values, but considering its relatively simple structure, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.50355759

This prediction takes into account that similar simple molecules with oxygen-containing groups often have values in this range, while acknowledging the presence of the N=O group which could contribute to a slightly higher value than simple alkanes or halides.

2. It has aromatic rings with halogen substituents (F, Cl)
3. The overall structure suggests it's a relatively polar molecule with H-bond donors and acceptors
4. It shares some structural similarities with compounds that have positive values in the training set

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data:
- Compounds with urea-like groups tend to have positive values
- Complex molecules with multiple functional groups often have non-zero values
- The presence of halogens and aromatic rings modulates the property

Considering all these factors, I predict the property value would be approximately:

5. It's an alcohol-like structure, similar to CCCCCC(O)CC (-0.82375223) and CCCC(C)CO (-0.82375223)

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
- Simple aliphatic molecules with oxygen tend to have values around -0.8
- Branched aliphatic molecules with oxygen typically fall in the range of -0.5 to -0.9
- The presence of ether linkages doesn't dramatically change the value compared to alcohols

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to other molecules in the training set, I predict the property value for CCCOC(C)C to be approximately:

-0.82375

This prediction takes into account the molecule's similarity to other aliphatic oxygen-containing compounds in the training set, particularly those with similar size and branching patterns.

4. The molecule doesn't contain any functional groups that typically lead to higher values (like -NO2, -NH2, or complex heterocycles)
5. It's a relatively simple, symmetric structure similar to many of the examples that have 0.0 values

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, I predict that the property value for biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be:

0.0

This prediction is based on its structural similarity to other simple aromatic hydrocarbons in the training set that have the same value, and the absence of functional groups that tend to give non-zero values.

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule (CCCCS) and the patterns in the training examples to make a prediction.

Looking at the training examples, I notice several patterns:

2. Molecules containing sulfur (S) show varying values but tend to be close to 0 or slightly negative
3. Simpler, linear molecules generally have less extreme values than complex ring systems
4. The presence of oxygen or nitrogen often leads to non-zero values

CCCCS is a relatively simple linear molecule:
- It's a butyl mercaptan (1-butanethiol)
- Contains a single sulfur atom
- Has a linear carbon chain
- No complex functional groups
- No rings or aromatic systems

Based on these observations and comparing to similar structures in the training set, I would predict a value close to 0, but slightly negative due to the sulfur atom.

My prediction for CCCCS would be approximately: -0.2

This takes into account that it's a simple molecule (like the hydrocarbons that tend toward 0.0) but contains sulfur which tends to contribute a slightly negative value in the training examples.

Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule "Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1" (which is methylnaphthalene), I notice several patterns:

1. Many simple aromatic hydrocarbons without polar functional groups have a value of 0.0

   - "c1ccccc1" (benzene) = 0.0
   - "Cc1cccc(C)c1C" (trimethylbenzene) = 0.0

The target molecule is a naphthalene with a single methyl substituent. It doesn't contain any polar functional groups (like -OH, -C=O, -NO2, etc.) that tend to give non-zero values in the training set.

Given that:
1. It's a simple aromatic hydrocarbon
2. Similar naphthalene derivatives in the training set have value 0.0
3. Other alkyl-substituted aromatics consistently show 0.0

Based on these observations, I predict the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 to be:

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 2.146502799646174
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the target molecule, I notice it's a barbiturate derivative similar to "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C" (which has a value of 2.1465028), but with an additional alkyl chain.

The target molecule "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C" has:
1. The same basic barbiturate ring structure
2. Similar CC=C group at one substituent
3. A longer alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) compared to just methyl in the reference molecule

Given these structural similarities and differences:
- The core barbiturate structure contribution would be similar
- The CC=C group contribution would be similar
- The longer alkyl chain would slightly modify the property value

Based on the patterns in the training set and the structural analysis, I would predict a value of approximately 2.4 for this molecule. This is slightly higher than the reference molecule (2.1465028) due to the additional alkyl chain, but maintaining a similar overall property range due to the preserved core structure.

Therefore, my predicted value is: 2.4

   - Halogenated aromatics (like Clc1ccc(I)cc1) tend to have a value of 0.0
   - Most simple substituted benzenes in the training set have values of 0.0 unless they contain specific polar groups like -OH, -C(=O), or -NH

3. Key observations:
   - The CF₃ group is relatively non-polar despite containing fluorine atoms
   - The molecule doesn't contain highly polar groups that tend to give higher or lower values
   - Structurally similar halogenated aromatics in the training set consistently show values of 0.0

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 to be:

0.0

This prediction is based on the consistent pattern that simple aromatic compounds with halogen substituents in the training set tend to have this value, and the CF₃ group doesn't appear to significantly alter this pattern based on the available examples.

OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO with a value of 10.50188668, which is a linear sugar alcohol structure.

3. The query molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a cyclic sugar structure (appears to be a pyranose form) with multiple hydroxyl groups.

4. Most other organic molecules without multiple OH groups have values closer to 0 or slightly negative.

Based on these observations, and particularly the similarity to the sugar alcohol example, I would predict a value around 9.8 for this molecule. This prediction is made because:

1. It has a similar number of hydroxyl groups to the reference sugar molecule
2. It's cyclic rather than linear, which might slightly reduce the value
3. It maintains the same general pattern of hydroxylated carbon backbone

Therefore, my predicted value is: 9.8

2. Molecules with amide groups (-NHCOCH3) often contribute to negative values
3. Para-substituted benzenes show moderate values
4. The combination of electron-withdrawing groups (nitro) and electron-donating groups (acetamido) on benzene rings appears in several examples with varying values

Based on these patterns and considering the structural similarity to nitrobenzene (O=N(=O)c1ccccc1, -0.5133686) but with the additional acetamido group, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.48

This prediction takes into account that the acetamido group would likely modify the base nitrobenzene value slightly, but maintain a similar magnitude due to the electronic effects of both substituents.

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of multiple polar groups
- The sulfonamide functionality
- The aromatic ring with amino substitution

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 4.157572095638813
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, I notice:

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.8701007040657227
Predicted Property:

- The length of the alkyl chain doesn't seem to significantly affect this value for esters
- The branching pattern (like in our target molecule) doesn't appear to substantially change this property

Given that our target molecule CC(C)OC=O is a formate ester and has a very similar structure to the examples above, especially CC(C)CCOC=O (just shorter by two carbons), I would predict the property value to be:

-0.8701007

This prediction is based on the consistent pattern seen in similar ester-containing molecules in the training set.

5. The molecule doesn't have multiple hydroxyl groups (which tend to give much higher positive values)
6. It's a relatively simple aromatic structure similar to other simple phenols in the dataset

Based on these patterns, I would predict a value close to -0.82, possibly slightly modified due to the methyl groups.

My prediction for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be approximately -0.82375223

This prediction is based on its structural similarity to simple phenol and the observation that methyl substituents don't appear to significantly alter this property in the given examples.

The target molecule has the same core structure (COP(=S)(OC)O-) but with different substituents (SC and C instead of Cl, Br, or I). The substituents are less electronegative than halogens but still maintain similar electronic properties.

Based on these structural similarities and patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.86767025

This prediction is based on the very consistent values shown by similar organophosphate structures in the training set, and the fact that the substituent changes aren't likely to dramatically alter this particular property.

Let me analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O - propyl nitrite) by comparing it with the training examples and looking for patterns:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- Simple alkyl chains (like CCC) typically have values around 0.0
- Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have positive values
- The closest analogues in the training set might be molecules containing nitro groups, though most examples have them attached to aromatic rings which show higher values

3. Key considerations:
- The molecule is aliphatic (not aromatic)
- Contains a single nitro group
- Has a short carbon chain
- Relatively simple structure compared to many examples

Based on these patterns and considering the molecule's structure, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.8 to 1.2

My best specific prediction would be: 0.95

This prediction takes into account that:
- It should be positive due to the nitro group
- The value should be moderate (not as high as aromatic nitro compounds)

Based on these observations and the structural similarities with some of the training examples, particularly those containing heterocycles and electron-withdrawing groups, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate size, presence of electron-withdrawing groups, and heterocyclic nature, while staying within the general range observed in the training set for molecules of similar complexity.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.8637888919927996
Predicted Property:
Looking at the training examples and analyzing the given molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, I notice it's very similar structurally to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 which has a value of -0.8669604. The only difference is that one has a double bond between the nitrogens (=N-) while our target molecule has a single bond (-NH-N-).

Given that:
1. The overall molecular framework is identical (two phenyl rings connected by nitrogen atoms)
2. The electronic distribution would be similar
3. The slight difference in bonding between N atoms wouldn't likely cause a dramatic change in the property

I would predict a value very close to -0.8669604, perhaps slightly modified due to the single vs double bond.

My prediction for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be approximately -0.87000208

This value is supported by seeing similar values for other aromatic amine-containing structures in the training set, such as Nc1ccccc1 which also has a value of -0.87000208.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 2.1465027996461723
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is a cyclic imide structure with a cyclopentane ring fused to it. Looking at the training examples:

1. It contains similar structural elements to O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC which has a value of 2.1465028
2. It shares some similarity with C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1 which has a value of 0.68322145
3. The cyclic imide structure appears in several examples with moderate positive values
4. The molecule contains multiple C=O groups, which tend to contribute to positive values
5. The cyclopentane fusion adds some lipophilic character

Considering these factors and the overall structural similarity to other cyclic imides in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

1.85

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has a similar core structure to examples with values in the 1.5-2.5 range, but is slightly simpler in structure, suggesting a somewhat lower value than the most similar example (2.1465028).

Iteration: 51
SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the target molecule "Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl", I notice:

1. It's a biphenyl structure with three chlorine substituents
2. It contains only carbon, hydrogen, and chlorine atoms
3. It's a relatively non-polar molecule
4. It has structural similarity to some of the other chlorinated aromatics in the training set

Looking at similar patterns in the training data:
- Simple chlorinated benzenes like "Clc1ccccc1Cl" have a value of 0.0
- More complex chlorinated structures like "Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl" also have a value of 0.0
- Most purely hydrocarbon or halogenated aromatic compounds in the dataset tend to have values close to 0.0

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict that the property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be:

0.0

This prediction is based on the consistent pattern seen in similar chlorinated aromatic compounds in the training set, particularly those with multiple chlorine substituents and biphenyl-like structures.

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 (diethylbenzene), I can make the following observations:

1. It's a benzene ring with two ethyl groups in para position
2. It's a relatively simple, symmetric hydrocarbon
3. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
   - CCCCCCc1ccccc1 (heptylbenzene) has a value of 0.0
   - Cc1ccccc1N (o-toluidine) has a value of -0.87000208
   - Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values between -1.0 and 0.0

4. The molecule is nonpolar and has no reactive functional groups
5. It's structurally most similar to the heptylbenzene example, but with a more symmetric and shorter alkyl substitution pattern

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately 0.0 for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1.

This prediction is made because:
1. The molecule shares structural similarity with other simple aromatic compounds in the dataset
2. The presence of alkyl groups on benzene rings in the training set tends to lead to values close to 0
3. The symmetry and nonpolar nature of the molecule aligns with other compounds that have values near 0

Therefore, my predicted value is 0.0

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 3.6403673003122425
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is sulfanilamide, which has:
- An aniline structure (Nc1ccc...)
- A sulfonamide group (-S(N)(=O)=O)
- Similar polarity to some of the nitro-containing aromatic compounds in the training set

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a value of 1.44069928
- Other aromatic compounds with polar substituents tend to have values between 1-4
- The sulfonamide group is similarly polar to a nitro group, though slightly less electron-withdrawing

Based on these observations and the structural similarities, I would predict a value of approximately 1.2 for this molecule. The value should be lower than the nitroaniline example (1.44069928) because the sulfonamide group is less electron-withdrawing than a nitro group, but still in a similar range due to comparable polarity and hydrogen bonding capabilities.

Therefore, my predicted value is: 1.2

- c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 (larger PAH) = 0.0
- Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32 (methylated PAH) = 0.0

3. Key observations:
- Pure hydrocarbon PAHs consistently show a value of 0.0
- The target molecule is also a pure hydrocarbon PAH without any substituents
- The molecule has a similar conjugated system to the examples

Based on these patterns, especially the consistent 0.0 values for similar PAH structures, I predict that the property value for c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 would be:

0.0

This prediction is made with high confidence given the clear pattern of pure PAH structures consistently showing this value in the training set.

- Phenolic compounds (with -OH groups on aromatic rings) typically show values around -0.6 to 1.6
- Complex oxygenated structures with multiple rings tend to have moderate positive values

Taking all these factors into consideration, and noting that this molecule has characteristics similar to flavonoid-type structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

1.42

2. Has sulfur and nitrogen atoms
3. Contains acetamide group (NC(C)=O)
4. Has methoxy (COP) and methylthio (SC) groups
5. Overall structure is relatively small and contains polar groups

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Molecules with P(=O) groups tend to have values around -0.4 to 1.0
- Presence of acetamide groups (NC(C)=O) typically contributes to values around -0.8 to -0.9
- Small molecules with multiple heteroatoms (N, S, P, O) generally show values in the negative range
- The combination of phosphate and amide groups appears in some examples with values around -0.4 to -0.9

Based on these observations and the structural similarities with molecules in the training set, I predict the property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC to be approximately:

-0.67

This prediction takes into account the molecule's size, polarity, and the presence of key functional groups that appear to influence the property values in the training set.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (trans-1,2-dichloroethene) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple hydrocarbons often have values of 0.0
2. Small molecules with halogens (like CCBr, CCCCBr) tend to have values close to 0.0
3. The presence of double bonds doesn't seem to dramatically affect the value by itself
4. The molecule in question (Cl\C=C/Cl) is relatively simple and contains two chlorines with a trans double bond

Given these observations and the molecule's structural similarity to other simple halogenated compounds in the training set, I would predict a value close to 0.0.

My prediction for Cl\C=C/Cl is: 0.0

This prediction is based on:
- Its structural simplicity
- The presence of halogens (Cl) similar to other halogenated compounds in the training set that have values of 0.0
- Its small size and symmetrical nature
- The fact that many simple halogenated hydrocarbons in the training set have values of 0.0

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.6438887356683176
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The molecule "c1ccncc1" is pyridine, a simple aromatic heterocyclic compound with one nitrogen atom in a six-membered ring.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple aromatic compounds often have values close to 0.0
2. Nitrogen-containing heterocycles tend to have slightly negative values
3. Similar structures like "c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23" have a value of -0.86976056
4. Other nitrogen-containing aromatics like "CNc1ccccc1" have values around -0.61394386
5. The simpler pyridine-like structure "COc2ncc1nccnc1n2" has a value of 0.62628797

However, pyridine is simpler than most of these examples and has just one nitrogen in the ring. Based on the structural patterns and considering that:
- It's a simple aromatic structure (which typically gives values closer to 0)
- It contains one nitrogen (which tends to make the value slightly negative)
- It's smaller and simpler than most examples

I would predict a value of approximately -0.45 for c1ccncc1 (pyridine).

This prediction takes into account both the aromatic nature of the compound and the electronic effects of the nitrogen atom, while considering that simpler structures tend to have less extreme values in this dataset.

Considering all these factors and the structural similarities with several training examples, particularly those containing ester groups, aromatic rings, and nitrogen-containing heterocycles, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.35

This prediction takes into account the molecule's mixed polarity, presence of both hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and its overall structural complexity.

2. Linear molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups often have negative values
3. Simple aliphatic chains without other functional groups tend to have values closer to 0
4. The presence of an alcohol group (-OH) typically pushes the value into the negative range

Given that CCCCCO is:
- A linear primary alcohol
- Similar in structure to other simple alcohols in the dataset
- Has no other functional groups or complex structural features

I would predict a value of approximately -0.82375 for this molecule, as this appears to be a common value for simple alcohols in the dataset.

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 1.811399116265646
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The target molecule contains:
- A cyclic structure with sulfone (S(=O)(=O)) and oxygen in the ring
- An amide group (C(=O)N)
- A phenyl ring
- Methyl substituent

2. Looking at the training examples:
- Molecules with amide groups typically have values between -0.9 and 2.0
- Cyclic structures with heteroatoms often contribute to slightly higher values
- Sulfur-containing compounds tend to have moderate positive values
- Phenyl rings without strong electron-withdrawing groups tend to keep values moderate

3. The closest structural analogues in the training set are:
- Molecules with amide linkages to phenyl rings
- Cyclic structures containing heteroatoms
- Compounds with similar complexity level

Based on these considerations and patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 to be approximately:

0.45

True Property: 7.479264462740647
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule and the given examples, I notice several patterns:

1. Molecules containing nitro groups (N(=O)=O) often have higher positive values
2. Complex heterocyclic structures with multiple functional groups tend to have non-zero values

4. Aromatic rings with substituents affect the property value

Looking at the target molecule:
- It contains a nitro group
- Has two ester groups
- Contains a complex heterocyclic core
- Has an aromatic ring with substitution
- Contains methyl groups (C) as substituents

Based on these structural features and comparing with similar molecules in the training set, particularly those containing nitro groups and complex heterocyclic systems, I would predict a value of approximately:

2.4

This prediction takes into account that molecules with nitro groups in the examples tend to have positive values (like the example with value 4.1575721), but the moderating effect of the ester groups and the heterocyclic core would likely bring the value down somewhat compared to the highest values in the dataset.

1. It contains a trifluoromethyl group (CF3)
2. Has a cyclic amide (lactam) structure
3. Contains two chlorine atoms
4. Has an aromatic ring
5. Contains a complex cyclic structure with multiple substituents

- Presence of amide groups and multiple halogens tends to increase the value
- Similar complexity molecules like O=C1N(COC(=O)CCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 had a value of 2.20095526

Based on these patterns and the structural features, I would predict a value of approximately:

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.015151946667643206
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecular structure of "COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O" (methoxy-nitrobenzene), I can make the following observations:

1. The molecule contains a nitro group (-NO2), which appears in some examples to contribute to higher positive values (like in O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O which has 3.6554449)

2. It has a methoxy group (-OCH3), which is a moderate electron-donating group

3. The structure is relatively simple with a single benzene ring substituted with two groups

4. Looking at similar aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups in the training set, the values tend to be either slightly negative or moderately positive

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, particularly considering the presence of the nitro group and comparing with similar structures, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has some similar features to the dinitrobenzene example (which has a value of 3.6554449) but is less electron-deficient due to having only one nitro group and having an electron-donating methoxy group instead of a second nitro group.

The target molecule appears to be a complex chlorinated cyclic structure (appears to be a chlorinated bicyclic compound). Looking at the patterns in the training data:

1. Highly chlorinated compounds like ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl have a value of 0.0
2. Simple chlorinated compounds like ClCCCl, CCCCl, CCCCCl all have values of 0.0
3. More complex structures with chlorine atoms tend to stay close to 0 or have small negative values
4. The molecule in question (ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl) is a highly chlorinated polycyclic structure

Given these observations:
- The molecule has multiple chlorine substituents similar to the hexachlorocyclohexane example
- It has a complex ring structure
- It lacks other functional groups that might contribute to larger positive or negative values

Based on the patterns in the training data, particularly how highly chlorinated cyclic compounds behave, I would predict the property value to be:

0.0

This prediction is based on the consistent pattern seen with heavily chlorinated compounds in the training set, which tend to have values of 0.0, regardless of their structural complexity.

- The relatively simple aliphatic chain
- The similarity to other simple organic molecules in the dataset
- The presence of oxygen atoms

The predicted value: -0.72

- The presence of sulfur linkages in molecules doesn't seem to dramatically alter the values
- Symmetric molecules with multiple aromatic rings often have values closer to 0 or slightly negative

Based on these patterns and considering the structural similarities with other organophosphorus compounds in the training set (particularly COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 which has a value of -0.67449076), I would predict a value of:

-0.67 to -0.70

The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is a nitrophenol, specifically 3-nitrophenol (or m-nitrophenol). Looking at the patterns in the training examples:

1. Similar structures in the training set include:
- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (nitrotoluene) with value -0.5133686
- Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 (chloroaniline) with value -0.87000208
- Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 (dimethylphenol) with value -0.82375223

2. Key observations:
- Molecules with phenol groups (-OH) tend to have values around -0.82
- Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) on aromatics tend to make the value less negative
- The meta-substitution pattern appears to have moderate effects

3. Considering these factors:
- The hydroxyl group would push towards more negative values (around -0.82)
- The nitro group would make it less negative (as seen in nitrotoluene example)
- The meta-substitution pattern typically has moderate electronic effects

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately -0.65 for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O.

This prediction takes into account both the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group and the electron-donating effect of the hydroxyl group, while considering their meta relationship.

Given these observations and considering that:
- This is a small, simple hydrocarbon
- It has a triple bond
- It's relatively symmetric
- It's similar in size to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

I would predict a value of approximately -0.30

True Property: -0.8237522337520979
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule "Oc1ccccc1Cl" (chlorophenol), I can make several observations:

1. The molecule contains a benzene ring with two substituents (OH and Cl)
2. Similar molecules in the training set include:
   - Fc1ccccc1 (0.0)
   - Clc1ccccc1I (0.0)
   - Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (0.85853387)

The closest structural analog is Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (nitrophenol), which has a value of 0.85853387. However, the nitro group (NO2) is generally more electron-withdrawing than chlorine.

Other monosubstituted benzenes (like Fc1ccccc1) tend to have values of 0.0.

Given that:
1. The molecule has a hydroxyl group like nitrophenol
2. But chlorine is less electron-withdrawing than NO2
3. The pattern suggests that simple halogenated aromatics often have values close to 0

I would predict a value between 0 and 0.85853387, likely closer to:

0.4

This represents a middle ground between the completely halogenated examples (0.0) and the nitrophenol value (0.85853387), taking into account the presence of both OH and Cl substituents.

Given the extremely close structural similarity between these molecules (they are isomers differing only in the position of chlorine atoms), and considering that the property appears to be influenced by similar structural features across the dataset, I would predict the property value to be:

-0.82375223

This prediction is based on the observation that very similar structures in the training set tend to have identical or very close property values, and in this case, we have an almost identical molecule with known properties to base our prediction on.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 21.89640128020091
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule and the given examples, I notice several patterns:

1. Molecules with multiple oxygen-containing groups (especially sugars/glycosides) tend to have higher positive values
2. Complex natural product-like structures with multiple rings and oxygen functionalities often have values between 2-12
3. The target molecule contains:
   - A methylenedioxy group (OCO)
   - Multiple methoxy groups (OC)
   - A lactone (COC=O)
   - A complex sugar moiety
   - Multiple fused rings
   - Several hydroxyl groups

Looking at similar complex structures in the training set, particularly those with sugar moieties and multiple oxygen-containing groups like:
- OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O (32.64634711)
- Other glycosides and complex oxygenated structures (values ranging from ~3-12)

Given the structural complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing groups, but noting that this molecule has fewer free hydroxyl groups than the highest value example, I would predict a value of approximately:

4.85

This prediction takes into account the molecule's similarity to natural product-like structures in the training set while considering it has fewer free hydroxyl groups than the highest value examples.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 1.9681139781593882
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, I notice:
1. It contains a heterocyclic ring structure with multiple nitrogen atoms
2. It has a thioether (CSc-) group
3. It contains a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)
4. It has a carbonyl group and an amino substituent
5. The overall structure is similar to some of the training examples containing heterocyclic rings with nitrogen atoms

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a value of 1.48403261
- Other heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen atoms tend to have values between 1.5 and 2.0
- The presence of sulfur and nitrogen atoms in heterocycles appears to contribute to positive values

Based on these observations and the structural similarities, I predict the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C to be approximately:

1.52

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to the training examples, particularly those containing heterocyclic rings with nitrogen atoms and similar substituents.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.8701007040657227
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate derivative, which contains:
- An aromatic ring (benzene)
- An ester group (-C(=O)OC-)
- A short alkyl chain (ethyl)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with ester groups (like CCCCC(=O)OCC) tend to have values around -0.87
- Simple aromatic structures with substituents tend to have values between -0.8 and 0.2
- The presence of oxygen-containing groups seems to affect the property value

Considering these patterns and the structural similarity to other molecules in the training set, particularly other esters and aromatic compounds with oxygen-containing substituents, I would predict the property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 to be approximately:

-0.82

This prediction takes into account:
1. The presence of the ester group
2. The aromatic ring
3. The overall molecular size and complexity
4. The similarity to other molecules in the training set with comparable functional groups

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and the patterns in the training examples to make a prediction.

CCCCCCCBr is a straight-chain heptyl bromide (1-bromoheptane).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple halogenated alkanes (like CI) tend to have values close to 0.0
2. Long straight-chain molecules with single functional groups often have values between -0.8 and 0.0
3. Molecules with similar structures like CCCCCCC=C have a value of 0.0
4. Other simple halogenated aromatics like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 also have values of 0.0

Given that:
- This is a simple straight-chain alkyl halide
- It's similar in structure to several molecules in the training set that have values of 0.0
- The bromine substitution appears similar in effect to other halogen substitutions in the training set
- The molecule lacks any complex functional groups that might lead to extreme values

I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be 0.0

This prediction is based on the observed pattern that simple halogenated hydrocarbons in the training set consistently show values of 0.0, and this molecule falls into that category.

Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.8237522337520979
Predicted Property:
Looking at the training examples, I notice several patterns:
1. Simple hydrocarbons (like CCC, CC#C) tend to have a value of 0.0
2. Molecules with alcohol groups (-OH) often have values around -0.82
3. More complex molecules with multiple rings or functional groups have higher values
4. The presence of oxygen atoms seems to influence the property

For "CO" (methanol):
- It's a very simple molecule
- Contains one oxygen atom as a hydroxyl group (-OH)
- Similar in structure to other simple alcohols in the training set
- Most simple alcohols in the dataset have values around -0.82

Based on these observations, particularly looking at similar simple alcohols in the training set, I would predict the property value for CO (methanol) to be approximately:

-0.82375223

This prediction is based on the consistent pattern seen with other simple alcohols in the training set, such as CCC(C)CO and OC1CCCCCC1, which both have exactly this value.
