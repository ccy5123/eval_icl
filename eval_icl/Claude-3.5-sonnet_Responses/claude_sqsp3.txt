SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 1.3153262182900172
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester of a long-chain fatty acid (methyl decanoate).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Long chain hydrocarbons (like CCCCCC) tend to have values around 2.12
2. Esters (compounds with C(=O)OC group) tend to have lower values than pure hydrocarbons
3. The closest analog in the training set is CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl dodecanoate) with value 1.43144851
4. Shorter chain esters like CCOC(=O)CC have values around 0.50929431

Since our target molecule is a methyl ester with 10 carbons in the main chain (shorter than the C12 example but longer than the short ester), I would predict a value between 0.50929431 and 1.43144851, but closer to 1.43144851 due to the similar long-chain nature.

My prediction for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be approximately 1.2

Based on these structural features and comparing with similar molecules in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.79577236

This prediction is based on the similarity to other heterocyclic compounds with carbonyl groups in the training set, particularly those with fused ring systems and similar functional groups.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 2.1220596321745613
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing patterns, I notice several trends:

1. Simple alkyl halides (like CCCCCl, CCI, ClCC) consistently show values around 2.12205963
2. More complex aromatic structures often have values closer to 0
3. Molecules with nitro groups (-NO2) or N-oxides tend to have negative values around -0.7 to -0.8

- It contains an N-oxide group
- It's not aromatic
- It has structural similarity to molecules with nitro groups in the training set (like Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO which has -0.79577236)

Based on these observations, I would predict a value of approximately -0.79577236 for CC(C)N(=O)=O.

This prediction takes into account both the structural similarity to other nitro-containing compounds in the dataset and the general trends observed in the molecular property values.

5. Similar in complexity to the steroid example in the training set: CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C (which had a value of 0.57261927)

Analyzing the patterns in the training data:
- Molecules with multiple ring systems tend to have values between -0.9 and 0.6
- Presence of oxygen-containing groups (ketones, alcohols) tends to pull values toward the middle range
- Complex steroid structures seem to have values around 0.5-0.6

Given these observations and the structural similarity to the steroid example in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.54

This prediction takes into account the slightly higher polarity of this molecule (due to the additional hydroxyl group) compared to the similar steroid structure in the training set, while maintaining the general magnitude appropriate for this class of compounds.

-0.85

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The molecule is purely aromatic
2. It has no substituents
3. It's similar to but slightly simpler than the reference compounds
4. The value should fall within the typical range for aromatic systems in the training set

Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule "Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1" (methylnaphthalene), I can make a prediction based on similar structures and patterns in the training data.

This molecule is very similar to several examples in the dataset:

- "c1ccccc1" (benzene) has a value of 0.0
- "CCc1ccccc1" (ethylbenzene) has a value of -0.86208673
- "Cc1ccc(C)cc1" (p-xylene) has a value of -0.86208673

The target molecule is a naphthalene with a single methyl group, which makes it structurally most similar to the dimethylnaphthalene example, but with one less methyl group. The presence of aromatic rings and methyl substituents in the training set consistently shows negative values in this range.

Based on these patterns and considering that the molecule has:
1. A naphthalene core (like several examples)
2. A single methyl substituent (less than the dimethylnaphthalene example)
3. Similar overall structure to other aromatic compounds in the dataset

I would predict the property value to be approximately: -0.67

This prediction takes into account that it should be close to but slightly different from the dimethylnaphthalene value (-0.67788016), considering the effect of having one less methyl group.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: -0.5673562211022266
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the given examples.

The target molecule is a barbiturate derivative with an unsaturated side chain, similar to some structures in the training set. Looking at the patterns:

1. It contains a barbiturate core (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1) which appears in one example: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C (with property value -0.94497968)

2. The main difference is in the substituent: instead of just a methyl and allyl group, it has a larger alkyl chain (C(C)CCC)

3. It maintains the CC=C (allyl) group similar to the reference molecule

4. The overall structure maintains similar polarity and hydrogen bonding capabilities as the reference barbiturate

Given these structural similarities and patterns in the training set, and particularly considering:
- The very close structural similarity to O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C (-0.94497968)
- The slight increase in lipophilicity due to the longer alkyl chain
- The maintained core pharmacophore

I would predict a property value of approximately -0.90 to -0.92, specifically:

-0.91

This prediction takes into account that the longer alkyl chain might slightly moderate the strong negative value seen in the simpler analog, but the core determining features remain largely the same.

Based on these observations and considering that:
- The molecule has a single aromatic ring (like many examples)
- Contains halogen atoms (like several examples showing values near 0)
- Has a structure complexity similar to other substituted benzenes in the dataset

I would predict a property value of approximately -0.50 for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1.

This prediction takes into account that the CF3 group is electron-withdrawing but not as strongly affecting the property as some of the more complex substituents seen in the training set.

3. Similar structures like "CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C" have a value of 0.63135658
4. "CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C" has a value of 0.85678158

Given that our target molecule:
- Has a similar steroid core structure

3. It's similar in complexity and basic structure to CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O from the examples, which had a value of -0.2357844
4. Looking at the patterns in the training set:
   - Complex ring structures tend to have negative values
   - Molecules with both oxygen-containing groups (hydroxyl, ketone) often have values in the -0.2 to -0.4 range
   - Steroids and similar structures typically show moderate negative values

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to known examples, I predict the property value to be approximately:

- Tertiary amine (CCN)
- Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)
- Trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)
- Alkene group (C=C)
- Substituted benzene ring

2. Looking at patterns in the training examples:

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.19894309051636494
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and the patterns in the training examples to make a prediction.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, a relatively simple ester.

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple aliphatic molecules with oxygen often have positive values
2. Esters (compounds with O-C=O group) tend to have values around 0.7-0.9
3. The closest structural analogues in the training set are:
   - CC(C)CCOC=O (0.73682626)
   - CCCCCOC(=O)C (0.90945413)

The target molecule is simpler than these examples but has the same functional group pattern. It's an ester with a branched alkyl group (isopropyl).

Based on these observations and the fact that simpler molecules tend to have slightly lower values than their more complex analogues with similar functional groups, I would predict the property value for CC(C)OC=O to be approximately:

0.73682626

This prediction takes into account that it's an ester (like the training examples) but is smaller and simpler in structure than the training examples with similar functionality.

2. The substituents (SC and C) are different but similar in electronic effects to the training examples
3. All similar phosphorothioate compounds in the training set have exactly -0.86208673

0.0

This prediction is made with high confidence due to the consistent pattern seen in very similar PCB structures in the training set.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 2.1220596321745613
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O - propyl nitrite) by comparing it with the training examples and looking for patterns:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple alkyl chains (like CCC) tend to have values around 2.12
- Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) generally reduce the value
- The closest analogues in the training set would be molecules containing nitro groups and short carbon chains

Based on these observations and patterns, particularly noting how nitro groups tend to decrease the value from the baseline alkyl chain values, and considering the size and composition of the molecule, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account that:
- The base propyl chain would typically have a high value (like other alkanes)
- The nitro group significantly reduces this value
- The molecule is relatively simple compared to many of the training examples
- The overall size and polarity would place it between the purely aliphatic and heavily substituted nitro compounds in the training set

3. Bicyclic structures with OH groups in the training set (like some of the steroid-like molecules) have values around 0.07-0.19

Given these patterns, and considering that this molecule is:

1. This molecule is very similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) from the examples, which has a value of -0.81214628
2. The only difference is that our target molecule has a methyl ester (COC(=O)-) instead of an ethyl ester (CCOC(=O)-)
3. Looking at other examples with similar aromatic carboxylic ester structures, they tend to have values around -0.8 to -0.9

Given that the structure is nearly identical to ethyl benzoate (just one carbon shorter in the ester group), and considering that this small change shouldn't dramatically affect the property, I would predict the value to be very close to -0.81214628.

My prediction for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is: -0.81214628

This prediction is based on the high structural similarity to ethyl benzoate and the consistent pattern seen in similar aromatic ester compounds in the training set.

Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. The molecule CC/C=C\C is very similar to CC/C=C/C which has a value of -0.50929431
2. The only difference is the stereochemistry of the double bond (cis vs trans)
3. In general, similar structures tend to have similar property values
4. The stereochemistry typically doesn't cause dramatic changes in molecular properties

Given that CC/C=C/C (trans) has a value of -0.50929431, and considering that cis-trans isomers usually have similar properties with small variations, I would predict that CC/C=C\C (cis) would have a value very close to this.

My prediction for CC/C=C\C would be approximately -0.50929431

The reasoning is that:

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

The molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a chlorinated phenol with three chlorine atoms and one hydroxyl group on a benzene ring.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (very similar structure) has a value of 0.0
2. Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 (similar trihalogenated benzene) has a value of 0.0
3. Other halogenated compounds show varying values

The most relevant comparison is the first molecule, which is actually a structural isomer of our target molecule, just with slightly different positions of the chlorine atoms. Given that this very similar molecule has a value of 0.0, and considering that the property appears to be relatively consistent for similar halogenated aromatic structures, I would predict:

Predicted value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl = 0.0

This prediction is based primarily on the direct structural similarity to the training example Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, as both molecules have the same number and types of substituents on a benzene ring, just in slightly different positions.

True Property: -0.6661400034412418
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the given molecule and the patterns in the training data, I observe that:

1. It's a complex natural product-like structure with multiple rings
2. Contains oxygen-rich functionality (ethers, esters)
3. Has aromatic rings with substituents
4. Contains multiple stereocenters
5. Has similarities to some of the larger, more complex molecules in the training set that tend to have values between -0.7 and -0.9

Looking at similar complex structures in the training set:
- Complex molecules with multiple rings and oxygen atoms often have values around -0.8 to -0.9
- Natural product-like structures with similar complexity show values in this range
- The presence of ether linkages and aromatic rings with oxygen substituents is similar to several training examples

Based on these observations and the structural patterns in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.86208673

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, oxygen content, and similarity to other complex natural product-like structures in the training set.

True Property: -0.4144647719090943
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, I notice:
1. It contains a heterocyclic ring structure with multiple nitrogen atoms
2. Has a thioether (CSc-) group
3. Contains a carbonyl group
4. Has a t-butyl substituent (C(C)(C)C)
5. Contains an amino substituent (-N)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen atoms typically have values around -0.7 to -0.1
- The presence of sulfur-containing groups tends to push values towards the negative range
- Molecules with similar complexity and mixed functionalities often fall in the -0.2 to -0.8 range
- The closest structural analog might be CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C with value -0.07427209

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C to be approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account the structural similarities to known compounds while considering the specific functional groups present in the target molecule.

True Property: -0.8121462789803878
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate, which contains:
- An aromatic ring (benzene)
- An ester group (-C(=O)OC-)
- A short alkyl chain (ethyl)

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Molecules with similar ester functionalities (like CCCCCC(=O)OC and CCCCC(=O)OCC) have values around 0.90945413
2. Simple aromatic compounds often have values close to 0
3. The combination of aromatic ring with ester functionality tends to pull the value towards the ester-like values
4. The size and complexity of the molecule seems to influence the magnitude

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to other esters in the training set, particularly considering the aromatic-ester combination, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.90945413

This prediction is based on the strong similarity to other ester-containing molecules in the training set, particularly the aliphatic esters, while accounting for the aromatic modification.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 2.1220596321745613
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and the patterns in the training examples to make a prediction.

CCCCCCCBr is a linear haloalkane (specifically a bromoheptane).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple linear molecules tend to have positive values
2. Halogenated compounds show varying values, but simple halogenated alkanes tend to be positive
3. Longer chain alkanes and their derivatives often have values between 0.5 and 2.0
4. Similar structures like CCCCCCC=C has a value of 0.19894309
5. Other simple halogenated compounds like CI has a value of 2.12205963

Given that this molecule:
- Is a linear alkane with a bromine
- Has similar length to some of the positive-valued examples
- Is structurally simpler than most negative-valued examples (which tend to be cyclic or aromatic)
- Has similar polarity characteristics to other haloalkanes in the dataset

I would predict a value of approximately 0.50929431 for CCCCCCCBr.

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is similar to other linear chains in the dataset while accounting for the bromine substitution, which typically doesn't cause extreme changes in the property values based on the patterns observed.
