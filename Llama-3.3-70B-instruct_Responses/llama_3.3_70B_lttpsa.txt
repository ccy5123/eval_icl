SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we should first identify any patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their corresponding property values in the given examples.

1. **Alkanes and Alkyl Chains**: Molecules that are essentially long chains of carbon atoms (alkanes) or have long alkyl chains tend to have negative property values, often around -674.49075948 or -155.67144145. This suggests that the property might be related to the energy or stability of the molecule, with longer alkyl chains contributing to lower (more negative) values.

2. **Aromatic Rings and Heterocycles**: Molecules containing aromatic rings or heterocycles (rings containing atoms other than carbon, such as nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur) tend to have more varied and often positive property values. This indicates that the presence of these functional groups can significantly affect the molecule's property, possibly due to their influence on molecular polarity, reactivity, or stability.

3. **Functional Groups**: Specific functional groups, such as carbonyl (C=O), hydroxyl (OH), or halogens (like Cl or Br), can also impact the property value. For instance, molecules with carbonyl groups adjacent to oxygen (as in esters, R-CO-O-R) tend to have property values closer to 0 or slightly positive.

Given the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we observe it has a long alkyl chain attached to a carbonyl group, which is part of an ester functional group. The presence of the ester group is significant, as seen in other examples where esters have property values around 0 (e.g., CC(C)COC(=O)C, CCOC(=O)CC, and CCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC all have a property value of 0.0).

Based on this pattern, the predicted property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be **0.0**, as it fits the criteria of having an ester group, which in the provided examples, consistently corresponds to a property value of 0.0, regardless of the length of the alkyl chain attached to the ester.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 505.22691869539636
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given molecules and their corresponding properties show a wide range of values, from negative to positive. To predict the property for the given molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to identify patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in molecular structures
Upon examining the molecules, it's noticeable that molecules with similar structures or functional groups tend to have similar property values. For example, molecules containing chlorine (Cl) and a benzene ring tend to have negative property values around -674.49075948, while molecules with a specific arrangement of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms tend to have positive property values.

## Step 3: Examining the given molecule
The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 contains a chlorine atom, a benzene ring, and an ester-like functional group. This combination of functional groups is not directly comparable to any single molecule in the given list but shares some similarities with molecules having negative property values.

## Step 4: Making a prediction based on patterns
Given the presence of a chlorine atom and a benzene ring in the molecule, which are common features among molecules with negative property values, and considering the unique arrangement of atoms in this molecule, it's reasonable to predict that its property value will be negative. However, without a direct match or a more detailed understanding of how specific functional groups contribute to the property value, the exact value is challenging to predict with high accuracy.

## Step 5: Considering the range of property values
Given the range of property values provided, from approximately -674 to 1538, and considering that the molecule in question contains elements (like chlorine and a complex ring structure) that are often associated with negative values in the provided examples, a reasonable approach would be to consider values that are within the range of negative values observed for similar structures.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-155.67144145}$

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 431.87925435687697
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given molecules and their properties show a wide range of values, from negative to positive, indicating that the property might be related to the molecular structure, possibly energy-related, given the range of values.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns or correlations
Looking at the molecules, there doesn't seem to be a straightforward correlation between the molecular formula or size and the property value. However, certain functional groups or structural features might influence the property. For example, molecules with multiple aromatic rings or specific functional groups like nitro (-NO2) or carbonyl (C=O) groups tend to have more positive or less negative values.

## Step 3: Examining the molecule of interest
The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a carbon chain. Given the presence of the nitro group, which is known for its high energy density, we might expect this molecule to have a relatively high value for the property, possibly more positive than the average of the given values.

## Step 4: Comparing with similar molecules
Comparing CC(C)N(=O)=O with other molecules containing nitro groups or similar functional groups might provide insight. For instance, Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO has a value of 1407.7109425, which is quite high. Although the structures are not identical, the presence of a nitro group in both suggests that CC(C)N(=O)=O could have a significant value.

## Step 5: Predicting the property value
Given the information and comparisons, predicting the exact value is challenging without a clear formula or more direct comparisons. However, considering the impact of the nitro group and the overall structure, we might expect a value that reflects high energy density or reactivity, potentially in the range of other molecules with similar functional groups but acknowledging the unique structure of CC(C)N(=O)=O.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1407.7109425}$

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in the molecular structures
Upon examining the molecules, we notice that many of them contain functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), carbonyl (C=O), and halogens (F, Cl, Br). The presence and arrangement of these functional groups seem to influence the property values. For example, molecules with multiple halogen atoms tend to have lower property values.

## Step 3: Focusing on the molecule of interest
The molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 contains a fluorine atom, a carbonyl group, and a chlorine atom. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the molecule may exhibit a property value that is influenced by the combination of these groups.

## Step 2: Look for similar molecular structures
The molecule CCCOC(C)C seems to be a relatively simple structure. Let's look for similar structures in the given examples. One similar structure is CCOC(=O)CC, which has a property value of 0.0. Another similar structure is CCCCO, which has a property value of -155.67144145.

## Step 3: Identify the functional groups and their potential impact on the property
The molecule CCCOC(C)C contains an ether functional group (C-O-C) and an alkyl group (C-C-C). The presence of the ether group might contribute to a higher property value, while the alkyl group might contribute to a lower property value.

## Step 4: Compare the molecular structure with the given examples
Comparing the molecule CCCOC(C)C with the given examples, it seems to be more similar to CCCCO, which has a property value of -155.67144145. However, the presence of the additional carbon atom and the branching in CCCOC(C)C might affect the property value.

## Step 5: Make an educated prediction based on the analysis

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 732.4508019259148
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or similarities that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Molecular Complexity and Size**: Larger molecules tend to have higher property values. The given molecule is of moderate size, containing a bromine atom, a carbonyl group, and an amide or imide structure, which suggests a certain level of complexity.

2. **Functional Groups**: Different functional groups contribute differently to the property. For example, halogens (like Br), carbonyl groups (C=O), and amide/imide groups can significantly affect the molecule's properties.

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**: Looking at the examples, molecules with halogens and complex ring structures tend to have higher property values. For instance, OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O has a value of 907.6132311, and CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)C(F)(F)F)C1C(=O)OC(C#N)c2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2 has a value of 846.83212464. These molecules have complex structures with halogens, similar to the molecule in question.

Given these observations, the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, with its bromine atom and complex ring structure including a carbonyl group, is likely to have a property value that reflects its moderate size and the presence of these functional groups.

**Prediction**: Based on the patterns observed and the presence of a bromine atom along with carbonyl and amide/imide groups, the predicted property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O would likely be in the range of 800 to 1000, considering the influence of the bromine and the carbonyl/amide groups on the molecular properties. A more precise estimate, without specific details on how the property is calculated or defined, would be challenging. However, for the purpose of this exercise and based on the provided examples, a value around **934.28510904** (similar to CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1) seems plausible, given the structural similarities and the impact of halogens and specific functional groups on the property values observed in the examples.

## Step 1: Analyze the given molecules and their properties
The given list contains various molecules with their corresponding property values. To predict the property for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, we need to identify any patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identify the molecular structure of the given molecule
The molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 represents a biphenyl, which consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond.

## Step 3: Look for similar molecules in the given list
We can see that there are several molecules in the list that contain benzene rings, such as Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1, Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O, and CC(C)c1ccccc1C. However, the closest match to the biphenyl structure is c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67, which has a property value of -674.49075948.

## Step 4: Consider the effect of the molecular structure on the property
The property values in the list seem to be related to the molecular structure, with some patterns emerging. For example, molecules with multiple benzene rings tend to have lower property values. The biphenyl molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 has two benzene rings, which might suggest a similar property value to other molecules with multiple benzene rings.

## Step 5: Predict the property value for the given molecule
Based on the analysis of the molecular structure and the patterns observed in the given list, we can predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2.

True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule CCCCCS, we need to analyze the given examples and look for patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their corresponding property values.

Upon examining the examples, it appears that the property value is related to the type of molecule and its functional groups. However, without more information about the property being predicted, it's challenging to provide a precise prediction.

That being said, based on the given examples, it seems that molecules with similar structures and functional groups tend to have similar property values. The molecule CCCCCS contains a sulfur atom, which is also present in some of the example molecules.

One example that stands out is CCOP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O, which has a property value of 757.58391768. Another example is CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -201.06492602. These molecules contain sulfur and have property values that are quite different.

However, there is another example, CCC1CCCCC1, which has a property value of -674.49075948. This molecule has a similar structure to CCCCCS, with a ring of carbon atoms. 

Given the lack of more specific information about the property being predicted and the presence of sulfur in the molecule CCCCCS, it's difficult to make a precise prediction. However, based on the examples provided, a reasonable estimate for the property value of CCCCCS might be around -674.49075948, considering the similarity in structure to some of the example molecules and the presence of sulfur, which doesn't seem to drastically alter the property value in the given examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CCCCCS is approximately -674.49075948.

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -155.6714414457389
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we need to analyze the given examples and identify any patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their corresponding property values.

Upon examining the examples, it appears that the property value is related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups or rings. However, without a clear understanding of the underlying relationship, it's challenging to make an accurate prediction.

That being said, let's look at some molecules with similar structures to CCCC(C)(C)CO:

* CCCC(C)(O)CC has a property value of -155.67144145
* CC(C)CC(C)O has a property value of -155.67144145
* CCC(C)(C)C has a property value of -674.49075948

Notice that the molecules with a similar backbone (CCCC or CC(C)CC) and a hydroxyl (-OH) or carbonyl (-CO) group tend to have property values around -155.67144145. In contrast, molecules with a similar backbone but without these functional groups tend to have property values around -674.49075948.

Given this observation, it's possible that the property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is closer to -155.67144145, as it contains a carbonyl group.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 1255.8864065235314
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we need to analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or similarities that could help in estimating the property value.

Given the complexity and diversity of the molecules in the examples, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact method or formula without additional context about the property being predicted (e.g., boiling point, molecular weight, solubility, etc.). However, we can attempt to make an educated guess based on the structural similarities and differences between the given molecule and the examples.

1. **Molecular Weight and Complexity**: Generally, as the molecular weight and complexity of a molecule increase, so does the value of the predicted property in the examples. The given molecule, O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, has a moderate size and complexity, with several functional groups that could contribute to its overall property value.

2. **Functional Groups**: The presence of specific functional groups can significantly affect the property. For example, molecules with multiple carbonyl (C=O) groups, as in the given molecule, tend to have higher property values. The combination of amide and alkene groups in the given molecule could also influence its property value.

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**: Looking at the examples, molecules like O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C (if it were in the list) would be a close match. Given that the provided molecule has an additional alkyl chain (CCC) attached, its property value might be expected to be higher than a simpler analog without this chain, due to increased molecular weight and potentially altered intermolecular interactions.

4. **Estimation**: Without a clear formula or more direct comparisons, we must consider the range of values provided in the examples. The property values range from negative (e.g., -674.49075948) to positive (e.g., 3354.75803221), with many values falling in the range of a few hundred to a couple of thousand.

Given these considerations and the absence of a direct method to calculate the property, a very rough estimate might place the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C somewhere in the positive range, potentially between 1000 to 2000, considering its moderate complexity and the presence of functional groups that could contribute to higher property values. However, this is a highly speculative estimate without a clear understanding of the property being predicted.

**Predicted Property Value**: 1437.91 (This value is a speculative estimate based on the analysis above and should be used with caution, as the actual property value could significantly differ based on the specific property being predicted and the underlying model or formula used to generate the example values.)

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding property values shows a wide range of chemical structures and values. To predict the property for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to identify any patterns or correlations between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in the molecular structures
Upon examining the molecules, it's noticeable that many of them contain aromatic rings (like benzene), and some have functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O), hydroxyl (OH), or halogens (like Cl, Br, I). The presence of these groups can significantly affect the physical and chemical properties of the molecules.

## Step 3: Looking for similar molecules in the given list
The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 contains a benzene ring and three fluorine atoms attached to a carbon atom, which is also attached to the benzene ring. This structure suggests that it might have properties related to fluorinated aromatic compounds.

## Step 4: Considering the effects of fluorination
Fluorination can significantly affect the properties of organic compounds, often increasing their stability and altering their reactivity. However, without a clear pattern or a similar molecule in the list, predicting the exact property value based solely on fluorination is challenging.

## Step 5: Examining the property values for clues
The property values range from negative to positive, with some molecules having values around 0.0. Molecules with similar structures or functional groups do not always have similar property values, indicating that the property might be sensitive to specific structural features or the arrangement of atoms.

## Step 6: Making an educated guess based on the absence of clear patterns
Given the lack of a clear pattern or a directly comparable molecule in the list, and considering the unique structure of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, it's difficult to make a precise prediction. However, many of the molecules with unique or less common functional groups or arrangements have property values that are either negative or significantly positive.

## Step 7: Considering the impact of fluorine atoms
The presence of three fluorine atoms on a single carbon atom, which is itself attached to a benzene ring, could imply a significant alteration in the molecule's electronic properties compared to non-fluorinated or differently fluorinated compounds. This alteration might result in a property value that reflects the molecule's increased stability or reactivity due to fluorination.

## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding property values shows a wide range of chemical structures and values. To predict the property for the molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, we need to look for patterns or similarities between the structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in the data
Upon examining the data, it's challenging to identify a clear, direct relationship between the molecular structures and their properties based solely on the information provided. However, we can observe that molecules with certain functional groups or structural features tend to have properties that are either positive, negative, or close to zero.

## Step 3: Examining the molecule of interest
The molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O appears to be a cyclic structure with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups attached, suggesting it could be a sugar or a similar polyhydroxylated compound. These types of compounds often have specific properties related to their solubility, reactivity, and biological activity.

## Step 4: Making an educated prediction
Given the lack of a clear algorithm or formula provided in the problem to calculate the property and based on the observation that many of the molecules with complex rings and multiple functional groups tend to have positive property values, we might infer that the property could be related to molecular complexity, polarity, or another factor that is not directly calculable from the information given.

## Step 5: Considering the property values of similar molecules
Molecules with multiple oxygen atoms and hydroxyl groups, like the one in question, sometimes exhibit high property values due to their potential for hydrogen bonding and their hydrophilic nature. However, without a specific pattern or a molecule very similar to OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O in the provided list, making an accurate prediction is challenging.

## Step 6: Final prediction
Given the cyclic nature and the multiple hydroxyl groups of the molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, and considering the property values of molecules with similar characteristics (such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO with a value of 2438.42514871), we might expect the property value of OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O to be positive and potentially significant due to its structure. However, without a clear pattern or a direct comparison, this prediction involves a high degree of uncertainty.

To predict the property for the given molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C, we need to look for patterns or similarities between the structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in the molecules
Upon examining the molecules, it's noticeable that many of them contain common functional groups such as carbonyl (C=O), hydroxyl (OH), and alkyl chains. The presence and arrangement of these groups seem to influence the property values. For instance, molecules with multiple carbonyl groups tend to have higher property values.

## Step 3: Focusing on the molecule of interest
The molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C contains several carbonyl groups, alkyl chains, and a complex ring structure. This suggests that its property value might be influenced by the combination of these features.

## Step 4: Comparing with similar molecules
By comparing the given molecule with others in the list, we can see that it shares some similarities with molecules that have multiple carbonyl groups and complex ring structures, such as CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of 437.77784275.

## Step 5: Predicting the property value
Based on the similarities and patterns observed, it's reasonable to predict that the property value for the molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C will be higher than that of simpler molecules but might not exceed the values of the most complex ones.

## Step 3: Examining the molecule of interest
The molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O has a complex structure with multiple rings and a carbonyl group (C=O), which could indicate a positive property value based on the observed patterns. However, without a clear understanding of how the specific arrangement of atoms and functional groups affects the property, this is speculative.

## Step 4: Considering the effect of oxygen and carbonyl groups
Molecules with oxygen and carbonyl groups tend to have a wide range of property values, but the presence of these groups often contributes to higher property values due to their ability to participate in various chemical interactions.

## Step 5: Predicting the property value
Given the complexity of the molecule and the presence of a carbonyl group, it might be expected to have a positive property value. However, the exact value cannot be determined with certainty without a deeper understanding of the property being predicted and how molecular structure influences it.

## Step 6: Looking for similar molecules in the dataset
The molecule CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O has a similar structure with multiple rings and oxygen-containing functional groups, and its property value is 363.14787659. This similarity could provide a basis for predicting the property value of the molecule of interest.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 700.136795958595
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, we need to analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or similarities that could help in estimating the property value.

Given the complexity and diversity of the molecules in the examples, it's challenging to establish a straightforward rule or pattern solely based on the molecular structures and their corresponding property values without additional context or a clear understanding of what the property represents (e.g., energy, reactivity, etc.). However, we can attempt to make an educated guess by considering the types of molecules and their functional groups that tend to have higher or lower property values.

1. **Observation of Examples**: Many of the molecules with complex ring structures, especially those with multiple rings and various functional groups (like oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur-containing groups), tend to have higher property values. On the other hand, simpler molecules, especially those that are essentially hydrocarbons or have minimal functional groups, tend to have lower (often negative) property values.

2. **Analysis of the Given Molecule**: The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 contains several functional groups, including a phosphorus group (P=S), oxygen (in several forms), sulfur, chlorine, and a complex ring structure involving nitrogen and oxygen. The presence of these diverse functional groups and the complexity of the molecule suggest it might have a relatively high property value compared to simpler molecules.

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**: Looking at the examples provided, molecules with complex structures and multiple functional groups tend to have property values that are positive and can be quite high (e.g., 1274.35155279 for c1c(O)C2C(=O)C3cc(O)ccC3OC2cc1(OC)). Given the complexity of the molecule in question, it might be more reasonable to expect a property value that is positive and potentially of a similar magnitude to these complex molecules.

4. **Prediction**: Without a clear pattern or a specific formula to apply, the prediction involves a significant degree of uncertainty. However, considering the complexity and the types of functional groups present in the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, a reasonable guess might place its property value in the range of several hundred to over a thousand, given the presence of multiple rings, a chlorine atom, and several oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus-containing groups.

Given the information and the need for a specific prediction, a value in the range of 800 to 1200 might be a plausible estimate, considering the molecule's complexity and the values provided for similar complex molecules in the examples. However, without more specific guidance or a clearer understanding of the property being predicted, this remains a very rough estimate.

SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -155.6714414457389
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can analyze the molecular structures and identify patterns to predict the property value for the given molecule CC(C)(C)CO.

The molecule CC(C)(C)CO appears to be a branched alkyl chain with a hydroxyl (-OH) group attached to the end. Upon examining the examples, I notice that molecules with similar structures, such as CC(C)CO, CCCCCC(C)O, CCCCCCCCC(C)O, and CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO, all have a property value of -155.67144145.

Given the similarity in structure, I predict that the property value for the molecule CC(C)(C)CO will also be -155.67144145. 

The final answer is -155.67144145.

SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 1234.3437358786516
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I will analyze the molecular structure of the given molecule, O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12, to predict the property value.

The molecule appears to be a heterocyclic compound, specifically a pyrimidine derivative. It contains two nitrogen atoms and a carbonyl group. The presence of the carbonyl group and the nitrogen atoms suggests that the molecule may have a relatively high property value.

Comparing the molecular structure to the provided examples, I notice that molecules with similar functional groups and heterocyclic rings tend to have property values in the range of 100-1200. For example, the molecule Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F has a property value of 1166.12527884, and the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)CC=C has a property value of 1255.88640652.

Based on this analysis, I predict that the property value for the molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 will be around 1166.12527884, similar to the value of the molecule Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1166.12527884}$

Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, let's analyze the given examples and look for patterns or similar structures that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Similar Structures**: Looking at the examples provided, there are a few molecules that share similarities with CC(C)OC=O in terms of functional groups or overall structure. For instance, molecules like CC(C)O, CCC(C)C, and CC(O)C(C)(C)C have parts of their structures that resemble the given molecule, but none exactly match CC(C)OC=O.

2. **Functional Groups**: The molecule CC(C)OC=O contains an ester group (OC=O), which is a significant functional group that can influence the physical and chemical properties of the molecule. Esters generally have distinct properties compared to alkanes or other functional groups.

3. **Property Trends**: Observing the property values:
   - Alkanes and simple alkyl chains tend to have negative values (e.g., CCC(C)C, -674.49075948; CCC(C)C1(CC=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O has a more complex structure but the alkane part contributes to its overall value).
   - Molecules with ester groups or similar polar functional groups tend to have positive or less negative values (e.g., CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC, 473.42583346; COc1ccc(C=O)cc1, 0.0).
   - The presence of halogens (like Cl) often results in a specific, repeated value (e.g., -674.49075948 for several molecules).

Given these observations and the fact that CC(C)OC=O contains an ester group, which is known to contribute to higher (less negative or more positive) property values compared to simple hydrocarbons, we can attempt to predict its property value.

However, without a clear, direct analogue in the provided examples, the prediction must be based on the general trends observed. Since esters tend to have more positive values and considering the simplicity of the CC(C)OC=O structure compared to some of the other molecules with more complex functional groups, a reasonable estimate might be a value that is positive but not excessively high, given the relatively small size and simplicity of the molecule.

Given the information and the need to make an educated guess, a predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O could be around 0.0, considering it's an ester and comparing it with other ester-like structures that have values around or close to 0.0. However, this is a very rough estimate and should be taken as a speculative prediction based on limited information and the patterns observed in the provided dataset. 

Predicted property value: **0.0**

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 380.3307210280574
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, we need to analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or similarities that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Analyzing the Examples**: The examples provided include a wide range of organic compounds with varying functional groups such as alkanes, alkyl halides, aromatics, amides, esters, and more. The property values range significantly, from negative to positive values, indicating that the property could be related to energy (possibly Gibbs free energy of formation or a similar thermodynamic property) given the context of molecular structures and their associated numerical values.

2. **Identifying Patterns**: 
   - **Aromatic Compounds**: Many aromatic compounds have negative property values (e.g., Oc1ccccc1Cl, -155.67144145; c2ccc1scnc1c2, -343.91334922). This suggests that aromatic rings might contribute negatively to the property.
   - **Aliphatic Compounds**: Some purely aliphatic compounds also have negative values (e.g., C1CCCCC1, -674.49075948), but the presence of certain functional groups like carbonyl (C=O) can significantly alter the value (e.g., CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, 71.80890215).
   - **Carbonyl and Amide Groups**: The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) and amide groups (-CON-) seems to increase the property value (e.g., CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, 71.80890215; Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1, 282.1064013).
   - **Esters and Ethers**: Esters and ethers can have positive or zero property values depending on their structure (e.g., CCCOC(=O)CCC, 0.0; OCC(O)CO, 881.96719462).

3. **Predicting the Property for O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2**:
   - The given molecule is an amide with two aromatic rings attached to the nitrogen atoms. Given the patterns observed:
     - Aromatic rings tend to contribute negatively.
     - The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in an amide linkage tends to increase the value.
     - The overall structure, being an amide with aromatic substituents, suggests a balance between the negative contributions of the aromatics and the positive contribution of the amide group.

Considering these factors, and without a clear quantitative method to apply from the examples, a rough estimate might place the property value of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 somewhere positive, given the amide linkage and the aromatic rings. However, the exact value is difficult to predict without a more detailed understanding of how each functional group and molecular feature quantitatively contributes to the property.

Given the complexity and the need for a quantitative model or more specific patterns, the prediction here is highly speculative. However, if forced to estimate based on the patterns of amides and aromatics, a value in the range of positive numbers, possibly closer to those of other amide-containing compounds (like CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, 71.80890215, or Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1, 282.1064013), might be expected. 

Thus, a very speculative prediction could be around 500-600, considering the balancing effects of the aromatic rings and the amide group, but this is a wide guess and should be taken as highly uncertain without further data or a model to predict such properties.

Iteration: 23
SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding property values shows a wide range of chemical structures and values. To predict the property for the molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13, we need to identify any patterns or correlations between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in the molecular structures
Upon examining the molecules, it's noticeable that many of them contain aromatic rings (indicated by "c" in the SMILES notation), and some have specific functional groups like carbonyl (C=O), hydroxyl (OH), or halogens (like Cl or F). The presence and arrangement of these groups might influence the property value.

## Step 3: Looking for similar structures to the target molecule
The target molecule, C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13, consists of two fused aromatic rings, suggesting it might be a form of naphthalene or a related compound. We should look for molecules in the list that have similar structural features.

## Step 4: Identifying similar molecules
Molecules like c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1 (which is not directly listed but can be inferred from the structure of c1ccc2ccccc2c1, -674.49075948) and others with aromatic rings have property values that seem to be related to their size and the presence of specific functional groups. However, without a clear pattern based on the number of rings or specific functional groups, we must consider the overall structure and potential similarities to known compounds.

## Step 5: Predicting the property value
Given the lack of a clear, direct correlation and the absence of a molecule with an identical structure in the provided list, we must consider the properties of similar aromatic compounds. Many of the aromatic compounds without specific functional groups (like hydroxyl, carbonyl, or halogens) tend to have negative property values, often around -674.49075948. This value seems to be a common property value for a variety of aromatic hydrocarbons in the list.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-674.49075948}$

Iteration: 24
SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 2455.8644535163025
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, we should analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or functional groups that could influence the property in question.

1. **Analyzing the Examples**: The examples given include a wide variety of organic compounds with different functional groups such as alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, aromatics, halogenated compounds, amines, amides, esters, ethers, and sulfonamides. The property values range significantly, from negative to positive values, indicating that the property might be related to the molecular structure, possibly to the energy or stability of the molecule.

2. **Identifying Patterns**: 
   - Many of the molecules with simple hydrocarbon backbones (like alkanes and some aromatics without specific functional groups) have a property value of -674.49075948. This suggests that the absence of highly electronegative atoms or specific functional groups that can significantly alter the molecular energy or stability might result in this value.
   - Molecules with certain functional groups like esters, amides, and sulfonamides tend to have more positive property values, indicating that these groups might contribute to an increase in the property value, possibly due to their ability to participate in hydrogen bonding or their effect on molecular polarity and stability.
   - The presence of halogens (like Cl and Br) in some molecules also results in a consistent property value of -674.49075948, similar to some hydrocarbons. This could imply that the effect of halogens on this property is not as straightforward and might depend on their position and the overall molecular structure.

3. **Predicting the Property for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**:
   - The given molecule contains several functional groups, including an amine (N), a sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O)), and an aromatic ring with an amine substituent. These groups are known to contribute to the polarity and stability of a molecule.
   - The sulfonamide group, in particular, is known for its high electronegativity and ability to form hydrogen bonds, which could significantly affect the molecular property in question.
   - Considering the presence of these functional groups and comparing with the provided examples, it seems reasonable to predict that the property value for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 would be more positive than -674.49075948, given the stabilizing effects of the sulfonamide and amine groups.

**Prediction**: Based on the analysis and the presence of functional groups that can contribute to molecular stability and polarity, a predicted property value for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 could be in the range of positive values, possibly closer to or exceeding 1000, considering the significant impact of sulfonamide and amine groups on molecular properties. However, without a clear understanding of the property being predicted (e.g., energy, stability, reactivity), this prediction is speculative and based on observed patterns in the provided data.

Given the speculative nature and the need for a precise answer, let's consider the influence of sulfonamide and amine groups on molecular stability and polarity, and predict a value that reflects the potential increase in stability or energy due to these groups. A value of **301.34092866** seems plausible, considering the molecule's structure and functional groups, and comparing it with the values provided for other molecules with significant functional groups.

True Property: 1621.3424263920283
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding property values shows a wide range of chemical structures and values. To predict the property for the given molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to identify any patterns or correlations between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in the molecular structures
Upon examining the molecules, it's noticeable that many of them contain aromatic rings, halogens (like Cl, F), and various functional groups (such as -OH, -COOH, -NH2). The presence of these groups can significantly affect the physical and chemical properties of the molecules.

## Step 3: Looking for similar molecular structures
The molecule in question, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, contains an aromatic ring, nitro groups (-N(=O)=O), and fluorine atoms. We should look for molecules in the given list that have similar structural features.

## Step 4: Comparing with similar molecules
One molecule that stands out with similarities is Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of 1495.1639269. Another molecule with some similarity is CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1, which has a property value of 154.90206035. However, the presence of fluorine and the specific arrangement of functional groups in the molecule of interest make it unique.

## Step 5: Predicting the property value
Given the unique combination of functional groups and the presence of fluorine in the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, and considering the property values of similar molecules, we can attempt to predict its property value. The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that can influence its property, but without a clear, direct analogue in the provided list, the prediction will involve some degree of uncertainty.

## Step 6: Making an educated guess
Considering the presence of nitro groups and fluorine, which are known to significantly affect molecular properties, and looking at the range of values provided for molecules with similar functional groups, we might expect the property value of the given molecule to be somewhat elevated compared to simple aromatic compounds but not as high as those with extensive conjugation or large molecular weight.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1495.1639269}$

Iteration: 26
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, let's analyze the given examples and look for patterns or similar structures that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Similar Structures**: Looking at the provided examples, there are a few molecules that share similarities with CC(C)OC=O in terms of functional groups or overall structure. For instance, CC(C)CCOC=O has a value of 0.0, and CCC(C)(C)O has a value of -155.67144145. However, the closest in structure to CC(C)OC=O from the given examples is CC(C)SC(C)C with a value of -674.49075948, but it contains sulfur instead of oxygen.

2. **Functional Groups**: The molecule CC(C)OC=O contains an ester group (OC=O), which is a significant functional group that can influence the property. Esters typically have different properties compared to alkanes or other functional groups due to the presence of the carbonyl (C=O) and ether (C-O) bonds.

3. **Property Trend**: Observing the given data, molecules with more complex rings or multiple functional groups tend to have higher property values (e.g., 1274.35155279 for c1c(O)C2C(=O)C3cc(O)ccC3OC2cc1(OC)). Simple hydrocarbons or molecules with halogens tend to have lower or negative values.

Given these observations and without a clear, direct analogue in the provided dataset, predicting the exact property value for CC(C)OC=O involves some degree of speculation. However, considering the presence of the ester group and comparing it with other molecules containing oxygen and carbonyl groups, we might expect its property value to be somewhat closer to those of simpler oxygen-containing compounds rather than the highly negative values of halogenated compounds or the very high values of complex ring systems.

Since CC(C)OC=O is structurally related to esters and considering the absence of a direct comparison, a reasonable guess might place its property value somewhere between the values of simple esters or ethers and more complex molecules. Given that CC(C)CCOC=O has a value of 0.0 and considering the impact of the ester group, a prediction for CC(C)OC=O could be closer to 0.0 or slightly positive, considering the general trend of oxygen-containing compounds without complex ring structures or multiple functional groups.

**Prediction**: Based on the analysis and the need for a numerical prediction, considering the structure and functional groups present in CC(C)OC=O, a predicted property value could be around 0.0, aligning with the value of similar structures like CC(C)CCOC=O, which also contains an ester group and has a value of 0.0. This prediction assumes that the property in question is influenced significantly by the presence of specific functional groups and their arrangements.

**Predicted Property Value**: 0.0

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -155.6714414457389
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyze the given molecules and their properties
The given molecules are represented in SMILES notation, and their corresponding properties are provided. To predict the property for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we need to identify any patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Look for similar molecular structures
The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 has a phenol group (OH attached to a benzene ring) and a methyl group (CH3) attached to the benzene ring. We should look for molecules in the given list that have similar functional groups or structures.

## Step 3: Identify relevant molecules with similar structures
One molecule that stands out is c1ccc(cc1)O, which has a phenol group but no methyl group. Its property value is -155.67144145. Another molecule is c1ccccc1, which is a benzene ring with no substituents, and its property value is -674.49075948. We can also consider O=c2[nH]c1CCCc1c(=O)n2C3CCCCC3, which has a more complex structure but includes an OH group, and its property value is 732.45080193.

## Step 4: Consider the effect of the methyl group
The presence of a methyl group (CH3) in the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 may affect its property value compared to molecules without this group. We should consider how the addition of a methyl group to a benzene ring or a phenol group might influence the property.

## Step 5: Make an educated prediction based on the analysis
Given the property values of similar molecules and considering the effects of the methyl group and the phenol group, we can make an educated prediction. The molecule c1ccc(cc1)O has a property value of -155.67144145, and the addition of a methyl group to the benzene ring in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 might not drastically change the property value, as the methyl group is a relatively small and non-polar substituent.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-155.67144145}$

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 35.64799070997976
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we need to analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or similarities that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Analyzing the Examples**: The given examples show a variety of organic compounds with different functional groups such as alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, halogenated compounds, and compounds containing sulfur, oxygen, and nitrogen. The property values range widely, from negative to positive, suggesting that the property could be related to the molecular structure, possibly related to energy or stability.

2. **Identifying Patterns**: 
   - Many of the molecules with simple aromatic rings or small alkyl chains have property values around -155.67144145 or -674.49075948. This suggests that these values might be associated with certain basic structural elements or functional groups.
   - Molecules with more complex structures, especially those containing multiple rings, halogens, or specific functional groups like COP(=S)(OC)O, tend to have more varied and sometimes higher property values.
   - The presence of sulfur in the form of thiophene (c1ccc2c(c1)ccc2) or as part of a larger structure doesn't immediately suggest a specific property value without considering the rest of the molecule.

3. **Predicting the Property for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**:
   - The given molecule contains a sulfur-containing phosphate group (COP(=S)(OC)O) attached to an aromatic ring, which also contains a sulfur atom (SC) and a methyl group (c(C)c1).
   - The closest analogs in the provided list are molecules containing the COP(=S)(OC)O group, which have property values of 35.64799071. This suggests that the phosphate group might be a significant determinant of the property value.
   - The additional sulfur atom in the aromatic ring might influence the property, but without direct analogs, it's difficult to quantify this effect precisely. However, given the consistency of the property values for molecules containing the COP(=S)(OC)O group, it's reasonable to assume that the overall structure of the molecule might not deviate significantly from this value.

**Prediction**: Based on the pattern observed with molecules containing the COP(=S)(OC)O group, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 would be close to **35.64799071**. This prediction assumes that the primary influence on the property comes from the phosphate group and that the additional sulfur and methyl substituents on the aromatic ring do not drastically alter the property value from the observed pattern.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we need to analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their corresponding property values.

Upon examining the examples, it's clear that the property values are related to the molecular structures, but the exact relationship is not straightforward. However, we can make some observations:

1. Many molecules with a similar structure, such as a benzene ring with various substituents, have the same property value of -674.49075948. This suggests that the property might be related to the presence of a specific functional group or molecular motif.
2. Some molecules with a larger molecular weight or more complex structure tend to have higher property values. This could indicate that the property is related to the molecular size or complexity.
3. The presence of certain functional groups, such as nitro (-NO2) or sulfonamide (-SO2NH2), seems to increase the property value.

With these observations in mind, let's analyze the given molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl. This molecule consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, with multiple chlorine substituents.

Based on the patterns observed in the examples, we can make an educated prediction:

* The molecule has a similar structure to some of the examples with a property value of -674.49075948, but it has more chlorine substituents and a larger molecular size.
* The presence of multiple chlorine substituents might increase the property value, but the exact effect is unclear.
* The molecule does not contain any obvious functional groups that would significantly increase the property value, such as nitro or sulfonamide groups.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be a value close to -674.49075948, but potentially slightly higher due to the increased molecular size and number of chlorine substituents.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 431.87925435687697
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyze the given molecules and their properties
The given molecules are represented in SMILES notation, and their corresponding properties are provided. To predict the property for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to identify any patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Look for similar molecular structures
The molecule CCCN(=O)=O contains a nitro group (-N(=O)=O) attached to a propyl chain. We should look for similar molecules in the given list that contain a nitro group or similar functional groups.

## Step 3: Identify relevant molecules with known properties
One molecule that stands out is O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of 2644.61928202. Another molecule is CC CN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of 1621.34242639. These molecules contain nitro groups, but their structures are more complex than the target molecule.

## Step 4: Consider the effect of the nitro group on the property
The presence of a nitro group typically increases the value of the property. However, the magnitude of the increase depends on the specific molecular structure and the position of the nitro group.

## Step 5: Estimate the property value based on similar molecules
Considering the molecule CCCN(=O)=O has a relatively simple structure with a nitro group attached to a propyl chain, its property value is likely to be lower than that of the more complex molecules containing nitro groups. A reasonable estimate would be a value closer to the lower end of the range, but still positive due to the presence of the nitro group.

## Step 6: Make a prediction based on the analysis
Based on the analysis, a predicted property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O could be around 500-600, considering it has a nitro group but a simpler structure compared to other molecules with known properties.

The final answer is: $\boxed{531.094}$

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, let's analyze the given examples and look for patterns or similar structures that could help in making an educated prediction.

1. **Halogenated Benzenes**: Many of the examples provided contain benzene rings with halogen substituents. For instance, Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, COc1cccc(Cl)c1, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl all have negative property values (-674.49075948, -437.77784275, and -674.49075948 respectively). The presence of halogens (like Cl, Br) on a benzene ring seems to be associated with negative property values, but the exact value can vary based on the specific halogen and its position.

2. **Variation with Halogen**: Comparing Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-674.49075948) with COc1cccc(Cl)c1 (-437.77784275), we see different property values despite both being halogenated benzenes. This suggests that the type of halogen and possibly the presence of other substituents (like the methoxy group in COc1cccc(Cl)c1) can influence the property value.

3. **Influence of Other Substituents**: The presence of other substituents like methyl (CH3), methoxy (OCH3), or larger organic groups can also affect the property value. For example, CCCBr (-674.49075948) and CCCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 (667.30986926) show how different the property value can be based on the substituents attached to the main chain or ring.

Given the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, it contains a fluorine (F) and a bromine (Br) attached to a benzene ring. Fluorine is a highly electronegative atom, and its presence can significantly affect the molecular properties. However, without a direct example of a fluorinated and brominated benzene in the provided list, we must consider the general trends observed:

- Halogenated benzenes tend to have negative property values.
- The specific value can depend on the halogen and other substituents.

Considering the electronegativity of fluorine and the presence of bromine, and without a clear example to directly compare, a precise prediction is challenging. However, given the trends, a negative property value seems likely. The exact value would depend on how the combination of fluorine and bromine on the benzene ring influences the property, which is not directly inferable from the provided examples without more specific information on how different halogens and their combinations affect the property.

Given the lack of a direct comparison and the need for a prediction, one might estimate the property value to be negative, potentially in the range of other halogenated benzenes, but the exact value could vary widely based on the specific effects of fluorine and bromine in this context. 

Therefore, without a clear and direct example for comparison, and considering the need for a numerical prediction, one might cautiously predict a value that reflects the influence of halogens on the benzene ring, potentially similar to other halogenated compounds listed, but this would be a very rough estimate without clear guidance from the examples. 

For the purpose of this exercise and acknowledging the uncertainty, a predicted property value might be estimated to be around -500 to -700, considering the general trend of halogenated benzenes having negative values, but this is highly speculative without more direct comparisons. 

Thus, a very tentative prediction for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 could be around -674.49075948, purely based on the presence of halogens and the lack of more specific guidance from the examples provided. However, this prediction is highly uncertain and should be treated with caution.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -155.6714414457389
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, let's analyze the provided examples to identify any patterns or correlations between molecular structures and their corresponding property values.

1. **Halogenated Compounds**: Molecules containing halogens like Cl, Br, or I tend to have negative property values (e.g., CBr, -674.49075948; Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl, -674.49075948). The presence of halogens seems to contribute to lower property values.

2. **Aromatic Rings and Heterocycles**: Compounds with aromatic rings or heterocycles often have positive property values (e.g., c1c(OC)c(OC)C2C(=O)OCC2c1, 473.42583346; CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NC(C)C)n1, 934.28510904). The complexity and the presence of these rings seem to increase the property value.

3. **Aliphatic Chains**: Longer aliphatic chains tend to have negative property values (e.g., CCCCCCCCCC(C)O, -155.67144145; CCCCCCCCCCI, -674.49075948), suggesting that as the chain length increases, the property value decreases.

4. **Functional Groups**: The presence of certain functional groups like carbonyl (C=O), hydroxyl (OH), or amine (NH2) can significantly affect the property value. For instance, molecules with these groups can have a wide range of property values depending on their position and the overall molecular structure.

Given the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, it contains an aliphatic ring structure with a hydroxyl group (OH) attached. Comparing this structure to the examples:

- It lacks halogens, which might suggest it doesn't have a strongly negative property value.
- It doesn't contain aromatic rings or complex heterocycles, which are often associated with higher property values.
- The presence of an aliphatic ring and a hydroxyl group suggests it might have a moderate property value, possibly positive but not as high as those with aromatic or complex heterocyclic structures.

Considering these factors and looking at the provided examples, a molecule like CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, which has a moderate complexity without halogens or extensive aromatic systems, might be expected to have a property value that is not extremely high or low.

Given the patterns observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 could be around 282.1064013, similar to CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which also contains a complex aliphatic structure with functional groups. This prediction is based on the structural similarities and the observed trends in the property values of the given examples.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 757.5839176782747
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we should look for similar structures in the provided examples and see if there's a pattern or a closely related molecule that can help us estimate the property value.

Upon examining the provided list, we notice a molecule with a very similar structure: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 757.58391768. The main difference between this molecule and the one we're trying to predict for is the presence of a chlorine atom (Cl) in the similar molecule, which is not present in our target molecule.

Given the similarity in structure and assuming that the property in question is related to molecular characteristics such as size, functional groups, or potential reactivity, we might expect the property value of the target molecule to be somewhat close to that of the similar molecule. However, without a clear understanding of what the property represents (e.g., energy, reactivity, solubility), it's challenging to make a precise prediction based solely on the removal of a chlorine atom.

Nonetheless, considering the structural similarity and assuming the property is influenced by the molecular structure in a somewhat predictable manner, we might estimate the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O to be in the vicinity of the value for the similar molecule, potentially slightly different due to the absence of the chlorine atom. 

Given the information and the need for a prediction, a reasonable estimate, keeping in mind the uncertainty and the lack of a clear pattern or formula provided, could be around 700-800, considering the removal of a chlorine atom might reduce the value slightly from the similar molecule's value of 757.58391768. However, this is a very rough estimate and should be taken as a speculative prediction rather than a precise calculation.

Therefore, a predicted property value could be approximately 750.0, acknowledging that this is a broad estimate based on structural similarity rather than a precise scientific calculation.

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 16.157002983659858
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding property values shows a wide range of chemical structures and values. To predict the property for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to look for patterns or similarities between the given molecules and the target molecule.

## Step 2: Identifying key structural features
The target molecule, Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, contains a benzene ring, an amide group (=O), and a pyrimidine or similar heterocyclic ring structure. These features are also present in some of the given molecules.

## Step 3: Comparing with similar molecules
One of the given molecules, CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2, has a property value of 1255.88640652. This molecule contains a benzene ring and a complex heterocyclic structure with amide groups, similar to the target molecule. Another molecule, CNc1ccccc1, has a property value of -365.9689406, but it lacks the complex heterocyclic structure present in the target molecule.

## Step 4: Considering the impact of functional groups
The presence of amide groups and heterocyclic rings can significantly impact the property value. In general, the addition of these functional groups tends to increase the property value due to their ability to participate in various chemical interactions.

## Step 5: Making an educated prediction
Given the similarities between the target molecule and some of the given molecules, particularly those with complex heterocyclic structures and amide groups, we can make an educated prediction. The target molecule, Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, is likely to have a property value that reflects its structural complexity and the presence of functional groups that can engage in significant chemical interactions.

The final answer is: $\boxed{308.52181888}$

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule CCCCCC(=O)OCC, we need to analyze the given examples and identify any patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their corresponding property values.

Upon examining the examples, it appears that the property values are related to the molecular weights or the types of functional groups present in the molecules. However, without more specific information about the property being predicted, it's challenging to provide an accurate prediction.

That being said, let's look at some of the examples provided:

- CCC(=C)C, -674.49075948
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl, -674.49075948
- CCCCC, -674.49075948
- CC(C)SC(C)C, -674.49075948
- CCCC(C)(C)CO, -155.67144145
- CC(C)C(C)O, -155.67144145
- CCC(O)C(C)C, -155.67144145

It seems that molecules with certain functional groups or structures have similar property values. For instance, many of the molecules with property values around -674.49075948 have halogen atoms (like Cl) or are hydrocarbons, while those with values around -155.67144145 have alcohol or ether groups.

Given the molecule CCCCCC(=O)OCC, it contains an ester group (=O)OCC, which is a type of functional group that can affect the physical and chemical properties of a molecule.

Looking at the examples provided:
- COC(=O)c1cc(O)c(O)c(O)c1, 1556.45795409
- CCOC(=O)N, 667.30986926
- CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC, 473.42583346

These molecules have ester or related functional groups and have positive property values. However, the exact prediction for CCCCCC(=O)OCC would depend on understanding the specific property being measured, which isn't clearly defined in the question.

Given the lack of a clear pattern or a defined property, and based on the presence of an ester group which seems to contribute to positive property values in some examples, a very rough estimate might be attempted. However, without a clear understanding of the property or a more defined relationship between structures and properties, any prediction would be highly speculative.

For the sake of providing an answer based on the information given and acknowledging the significant uncertainty:

The final answer is $\boxed{0.0}$.

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, let's analyze the given examples and look for patterns or similar structures that could help in making an educated prediction.

1. **Similar Structures**: Looking at the provided examples, there are a few molecules that share similarities with the target molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1. For instance, CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 has a value of 518.81931803, and COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C has a value of 757.58391768. However, the closest in structure to COC(=O)c1ccccc1 from the given examples is CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1, but without the hydroxyl (-OH) group on the benzene ring, the target molecule is more similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 than to any other given example.

2. **Functional Groups**: The target molecule contains a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to an oxygen (part of an ester group) and a benzene ring. The presence of these functional groups can significantly influence the property value. Ester groups and benzene rings are common in organic chemistry and can affect physical and chemical properties due to their electron-withdrawing and electron-donating capabilities.

3. **Pattern Recognition**: From the examples given, molecules with simpler structures (like ClC=C(Cl)Cl or CCC(C)(C)O) tend to have negative or zero property values, while more complex molecules (like those with multiple rings, esters, or amides) tend to have positive property values. This suggests that the complexity and specific functional groups present in a molecule can influence its property value.

Given these observations and the fact that COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is structurally similar to some of the molecules with positive property values (due to the presence of the ester group and the benzene ring), but lacks additional complex functionalities that significantly increase the value (like additional rings or nitrogen-containing groups), we might expect its property value to be positive but not excessively high.

**Prediction**: Based on the pattern that molecules with ester groups and benzene rings tend to have positive property values, and considering the simplicity of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 compared to other molecules with higher values, a reasonable prediction might place its property value in a moderate positive range. However, without a clear, direct comparison or a specific formula/model derived from the given examples, this prediction involves a degree of uncertainty.

Given the information and the need for a numerical prediction, considering the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 has a value of 518.81931803 and assuming the absence of the hydroxyl group might slightly decrease this value due to less electron donation into the benzene ring, a predicted value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 could be somewhat lower than 518.81931803 but still positive.

**Predicted Value**: 0.0

This prediction is based on the observation that CC(C)OC(=O)C and CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 have a property value of 0.0, suggesting that the specific arrangement of functional groups in COC(=O)c1ccccc1 might result in a similar property value, especially considering the potential balancing effects of the ester group and the benzene ring on the molecule's overall properties.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I will attempt to predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C.

Upon examining the given molecules and their corresponding property values, I notice that the property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups or the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule C=CCC=C appears to be a simple alkene with a conjugated double bond system. Comparing this molecule to the provided examples, I notice that molecules with similar structural features, such as CC/C=C/C and C=Cc1ccccc1, have property values of -674.49075948 and -674.49075948, respectively.

Given the similarity in molecular structure, I predict that the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C will be similar to these examples. Therefore, I predict the property value to be -674.49075948.

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding properties shows a wide range of chemical structures and property values. To predict the property for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we need to look for patterns or correlations between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in the molecular structures
Upon examining the molecular structures, it is noticed that many of the molecules with property values of -674.49075948 have a common feature of being aromatic hydrocarbons or having a similar structural motif. This suggests that the property value might be related to the molecular structure, possibly indicating a specific type of molecular energy or stability.

## Step 3: Focusing on the molecule BrC(Br)Br
The molecule BrC(Br)Br, also known as tribromomethane, has a distinct structure with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. This structure does not resemble the aromatic hydrocarbons or the specific motifs seen in the molecules with the property value of -674.49075948.

## Step 4: Looking for similar molecules in the given list
There are no molecules in the given list that have a similar structure to BrC(Br)Br. However, we can look for molecules with similar functional groups or atoms. The presence of bromine atoms in BrC(Br)Br is notable, but there are no other molecules with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon.

## Step 5: Considering the property values of molecules with halogen atoms
Molecules with halogen atoms, such as chlorine or fluorine, are present in the list. For example, the molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -674.49075948, and the molecule FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br also has a property value of -674.49075948. This suggests that the presence of halogen atoms might not be directly correlated with a specific property value.

## Step 6: Predicting the property value for BrC(Br)Br
Given the lack of similar molecules in the list and the absence of a clear correlation between molecular structure and property value, it is challenging to make a precise prediction. However, considering the unique structure of BrC(Br)Br and the fact that many molecules with distinct structures have property values of -674.49075948, it is possible that BrC(Br)Br might also have a property value similar to this.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-674.49075948}$

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 757.5839176782747
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we need to analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or similarities that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Analyzing the Examples**: The provided examples show a wide range of molecular structures along with their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, but without a clear, direct formula provided in the question, we must infer based on patterns.

2. **Pattern Recognition**: 
   - Many molecules with simple hydrocarbon chains or basic aromatic rings have a property value of -674.49075948. This suggests that this value might be associated with molecules that do not have complex functional groups or a high degree of unsaturation.
   - Molecules with more complex structures, especially those containing multiple functional groups (like esters, amides, sulfones, etc.), tend to have higher property values. This could indicate that the property is related to the molecular weight, complexity, or the presence of specific functional groups.
   - The presence of certain functional groups like carbonyl (C=O), sulfonyl (S=O), or nitro (N=O) groups seems to increase the property value significantly.

3. **Predicting the Property for CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**:
   - The given molecule contains several functional groups, including a phosphorus-oxygen double bond (P=O, implied by OP(=S)), a sulfonyl group (S=O), an ester or ether group (OCC), a chloroalkyl group (CCl), and an amide group (N2C(=O)).
   - The presence of these functional groups, especially the sulfonyl and amide groups, suggests that the molecule is relatively complex and might have a higher property value compared to simple hydrocarbons.
   - Considering the complexity and the types of functional groups present, we might expect the property value to be higher than -674.49075948 but not as high as some of the more complex molecules listed.

Given the information and the need to make an educated guess, it seems reasonable to predict that the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be somewhere in the range of the more complex molecules but not exceeding the values of the most complex ones provided.

**Prediction**: Based on the patterns observed and without a specific formula to apply, a reasonable prediction might place the property value in the range of 400 to 1200, considering the molecule's complexity and the functional groups present. However, this is a broad estimate and could vary widely depending on the actual property being predicted.

For the purpose of this exercise and acknowledging the significant uncertainty, let's propose a value that reflects the molecule's complexity relative to the examples given: **800 ± 200**. This range acknowledges the presence of multiple functional groups and the molecule's complexity but also recognizes the uncertainty in predicting such properties without a clear algorithm or formula provided.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 1386.6811925817303
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding property values shows a wide range of chemical structures and values. To predict the property for the given molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to look for patterns or similarities between the structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns or functional groups
Upon examining the list, it's noticeable that molecules with certain functional groups or structural features tend to have property values that fall within specific ranges. For example, molecules with long alkyl chains (like CCCCCC#C, CCC(C)C, and CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC) tend to have negative property values around -674.49075948. Molecules with aromatic rings and specific substituents (like Cc1ccc(O)cc1 and CC(O)c1ccccc1) have property values around -155.67144145.

## Step 3: Examining the query molecule
The molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C contains several functional groups, including an amide group (C(=O)N), an aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent, and a urea-like structure. The presence of these groups, especially the amide and the aromatic ring with a halogen, suggests that its property value might be more positive compared to simple hydrocarbons but could be influenced by the variety of functional groups present.

## Step 4: Comparing with similar molecules
Molecules like NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1 with a property value of 301.34092866 and CN(C)C(=O)C with a property value of -153.61975853 provide some insight. The query molecule, having a more complex structure with additional functional groups, might exhibit a property value that reflects the combination of these groups' effects.

## Step 5: Predicting the property value
Given the complexity of the molecule and the variety of functional groups, it's reasonable to expect that its property value will be significantly different from those of simple hydrocarbons or molecules with single functional groups. The presence of the amide group, the aromatic ring, and the chlorine substituent, along with the urea-like structure, suggests a value that could be positive, considering the contributions of these functional groups to the molecular properties.

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 81.04147528311944
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, let's analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or similar structures that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Similar Structures**: The given molecule has two benzene rings connected by an oxygen atom, with chlorine substitutions on both rings. Let's look for similar structures in the provided examples:
   - Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of -155.67144145. This molecule has one benzene ring with two chlorine atoms.
   - c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2 has a property value of -674.49075948. This molecule has two benzene rings connected, but without any oxygen or chlorine substitutions as in the target molecule.
   - Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 has a property value of -674.49075948, similar to the previous one but with chlorine substitutions.

2. **Effect of Chlorine and Oxygen**: Chlorine atoms tend to decrease the property value (as seen in Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl), and the presence of an oxygen atom connecting two rings might have a specific effect, but it's less clear without more direct comparisons.

3. **Property Value Ranges**: The property values range widely, from negative (e.g., -674.49075948 for several molecules) to positive values (e.g., 4514.21534156 for a complex molecule with many oxygen and carbon atoms). The presence of chlorine and the structure of the molecule seem to influence the property value significantly.

Given these observations and without a clear, direct comparison, predicting the exact property value is challenging. However, considering the molecule has two benzene rings with chlorine substitutions and an oxygen connecting them, we might expect a value that reflects the influence of these chlorines and the oxygen bridge.

**Prediction Approach**:
- The molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl has a value of -155.67144145, and when considering the effect of adding another ring (as in Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 with a value of -674.49075948), it suggests that adding complexity and more rings can significantly decrease the property value.
- However, the connecting oxygen and the specific arrangement of chlorines in Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl might mitigate this effect to some extent.

**Predicted Property Value**:
Given the complexity and the specific arrangement of this molecule, and considering the provided examples, a reasonable prediction might lean towards a negative value, reflecting the influence of the chlorine atoms and the oxygen bridge. However, without a more direct comparison or a clearer understanding of how these structural elements quantitatively affect the property value, the prediction involves significant uncertainty.

A speculative prediction, based on the patterns observed and considering the complexity of the molecule, might place the property value in the range of -500 to -700, considering the effects of chlorine substitutions and the oxygen bridge. However, this is a very rough estimate and should be taken with caution.

**Final Prediction**: -600.0

This prediction is highly speculative and based on limited patterns observed in the provided data. The actual property value could significantly differ based on the specific chemical and physical principles governing this property, which are not explicitly stated in the problem.

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -437.7778427477369
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule CCCOCC, let's analyze the given examples and look for patterns or similarities that could help in determining the property value.

1. **Molecules with Similar Structures**: Many of the molecules provided have diverse structures, making it challenging to identify a specific pattern based solely on their chemical formulas. However, we can observe that molecules with certain functional groups or structural features tend to have similar property values.

2. **Property Value Patterns**: 
   - A significant number of molecules have a property value of -674.49075948. These include simple hydrocarbons (like C, CC#C, CCC#C, C1CCCCCC1), halogenated compounds (like ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, Clc1cccc(I)c1, Clc1cccc(Br)c1), and some compounds with sulfur (like CCSSCC).
   - Molecules with a property value of -155.67144145 often contain oxygen in the form of alcohols or ethers (like CCCOCC, which is the molecule of interest, CCC(C)O, CC(C)(C)c1ccc(O)cc1, CCC(O)CC).
   - Other property values seem to be associated with more complex structures, including those with nitrogen, multiple rings, or specific functional groups like amides, esters, and nitriles.

Given the molecule CCCOCC, which contains an ether functional group, we can look for similar molecules in the provided list. The closest matches in terms of functional group similarity are those with ether or alcohol groups, which have a property value of -155.67144145.

**Prediction**: Based on the structural similarity with other molecules containing ether or alcohol groups, the predicted property value for the molecule CCCOCC is -155.67144145. This prediction is made under the assumption that the property in question is related to the molecular structure, possibly related to energy levels or stability, given the diversity of values and the types of molecules listed.

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 154.90206035127895
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, let's analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or similarities that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Molecular Size and Complexity**: Larger, more complex molecules tend to have higher property values. The given molecule is relatively complex, with two phenyl rings and a peptide-like structure, suggesting a potentially higher property value.

2. **Functional Groups**: Certain functional groups may contribute to the property value. For example, the presence of nitro groups (N(=O)=O) seems to increase the property value significantly, as seen in molecules like Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O with a value of 2057.06858622. However, the given molecule does not contain such groups but has amide and aromatic rings, which could contribute to its value.

3. **Comparison with Similar Structures**: Looking at molecules with similar structures can provide clues. For instance, CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 has a value of 413.67056845. This molecule shares some similarities with the given molecule, such as the presence of a carbonyl group attached to a nitrogen and aromatic rings, but it lacks the additional phenyl ring and the tert-butyl group present in the given molecule.

4. **Effect of Aromatic Rings**: Aromatic rings seem to contribute to higher property values, but their effect can be variable depending on the rest of the molecule. The presence of two phenyl rings in the given molecule could increase its property value compared to molecules with fewer or no aromatic rings.

Given these considerations, the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 seems to be moderately complex with two phenyl rings and a peptide bond, which could place its property value somewhere in the middle to higher range of the provided examples. However, without a clear, direct comparison or a specific formula to apply, the prediction must be somewhat qualitative.

Considering the complexity, the presence of aromatic rings, and the peptide bond, a reasonable estimate might place the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 in the range of values seen for moderately complex organic molecules with aromatic rings, potentially higher than 400 but likely not exceeding 1200, given the absence of highly polar or highly energetic functional groups like nitro groups.

Thus, a predicted property value could be around 800, considering the molecule's structure and the values of similar molecules provided. However, this is a rough estimate and should be taken as a qualitative prediction rather than a precise calculation. 

Predicted property value: Approximately 800.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 71.8089021495995
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyze the given molecules and their properties
The given molecules are represented in SMILES notation, and their corresponding properties are provided. To predict the property for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we need to identify patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identify the functional groups and their effects on the property
The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains several functional groups, including an amide group (CC(=O)N), an aromatic ring (c1ccc(Br)cc1), and a bromine substituent (Br). We need to consider how these functional groups contribute to the overall property.

## Step 3: Compare the given molecule to similar molecules
We can compare the given molecule to similar molecules in the provided list, such as Oc1ccc(Br)cc1, which has a property value of -155.67144145, and CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 154.90206035. The presence of the amide group and the aromatic ring in the given molecule suggests that its property value may be closer to that of the latter molecule.

## Step 4: Estimate the property value based on the identified patterns
Considering the effects of the functional groups and the comparison to similar molecules, we can estimate the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1. The amide group and the aromatic ring are likely to contribute to a higher property value, while the bromine substituent may have a smaller effect.

The final answer is: $\boxed{431.87925436}$

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding properties shows a wide range of chemical structures and property values. To predict the property for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we need to identify any patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in the molecular structures
Upon examining the molecules, it's noticeable that many of them contain aromatic rings (indicated by "c" in the SMILES notation), alkyl chains (indicated by "C"), and various functional groups. The presence of these features seems to influence the property values.

## Step 3: Focusing on molecules with similar structures
The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 contains an alkyl chain and an aromatic ring, which are common features in many of the given molecules. By comparing this molecule to others with similar structures, we can make a more informed prediction.

## Step 4: Comparing with similar molecules
Molecules like CC(C)CO, CCCCCC(O)CC, and CC(C)CCO all have property values of -155.67144145. These molecules have alkyl chains and a functional group (such as a carbonyl or hydroxyl group) but lack an aromatic ring. The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, however, includes an aromatic ring, which might affect its property value.

## Step 5: Considering the effect of the aromatic ring
Molecules with aromatic rings, such as Cc1ccccc1N and C=Cc1ccccc1, have property values of -7.18089021 and -674.49075948, respectively. The presence of the aromatic ring seems to significantly impact the property value, often resulting in more negative values.

## Step 6: Predicting the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
Given the combination of an alkyl chain and an aromatic ring in CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, and considering the property values of similar molecules, it's reasonable to predict that the property value for this molecule will be closer to those of molecules with aromatic rings. However, the exact value is difficult to determine without a clear pattern or formula. Based on the provided data, a molecule with a similar structure, CCc1ccc(C)cc1, has a property value of -674.49075948.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-674.49075948}$

Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -236.71291672885832
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, let's analyze the given examples and look for patterns or similar structures that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Benzene Ring (c1ccccc1)**: Many molecules contain a benzene ring, and when this ring is present without additional functional groups that significantly alter the molecule's properties (like nitro, carboxyl, etc.), the property values tend to be around -674.49075948. Examples include Cc1cccc2c(C)cccc12, c1cncnc1 is an exception due to its different ring structure, and many others with the benzene ring but without specific functional groups that drastically change the property.

2. **Carbonyl Group (C=O)**: The presence of a carbonyl group attached directly to a benzene ring, as in NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (949.41627056) and O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (818.10856378), tends to increase the property value significantly compared to the base benzene ring structure.

Given the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, it contains a benzene ring with a carbonyl group (aldehyde, in this case) directly attached. This structure is similar to benzaldehyde. Considering the impact of the carbonyl group on the benzene ring, we might expect a significant increase in the property value compared to the bare benzene ring but not as high as molecules with additional functional groups that further increase the value.

Looking at the examples:
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1O has a value of 949.41627056, which includes an amide and an additional oxygen, suggesting these additional groups contribute to a higher value.
- O=C1NC(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 has a value of 818.10856378, indicating the presence of additional rings and nitrogen contributes to its high value.

Given the molecule in question, O=Cc1ccccc1, is simpler, lacking the additional nitrogen and oxygen atoms found in the higher-value examples, we might expect its value to be lower than those with more complex functional groups but still higher than the base -674.49075948 due to the presence of the carbonyl group.

A reasonable estimate, considering the absence of specific examples with just a carbonyl group attached to a benzene ring, might place the value somewhere above the base benzene ring value but not as high as the more complex structures. However, without a direct example of benzaldehyde or a very similar structure, this prediction involves some uncertainty.

Given the information and looking for a pattern or a similar molecule to base the prediction on, a possible estimate could be around the value of similar simple aromatic compounds with a carbonyl group, but since there's no direct comparison, the prediction would be speculative.

However, considering the pattern and the effect of the carbonyl group, a speculative prediction might place the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 in a range that reflects the presence of the carbonyl group on a benzene ring, potentially closer to values seen with simple modifications of the benzene ring but without the exact example to firmly base this prediction on.

Given the lack of a direct example and the need to make an educated guess based on the patterns observed, the property value could potentially be estimated to be higher than -674.49075948, considering the impact of the carbonyl group, but the exact value is difficult to predict without more direct comparisons.

For the sake of providing a numerical answer based on the observed patterns and the understanding that the carbonyl group increases the value, but lacking a precise example for O=Cc1ccccc1, one might consider values of similar compounds as a reference. However, it's crucial to note that without a direct example or a more detailed understanding of how each functional group contributes to the property value, this prediction is highly speculative.

Given the speculative nature and the need to follow the format, I will provide a value that reflects an increase due to the carbonyl group but acknowledge this is a rough estimate without a clear basis from the provided examples. 

The final answer is $\boxed{949.41627056}$.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 2353.023847223483
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding property values shows a wide range of chemical structures and values. To predict the property for the given molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to look for patterns or similarities between the structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in the properties
Upon examining the list, it's noticeable that many molecules with complex ring structures and multiple functional groups tend to have higher property values, while simpler molecules, especially those with fewer carbon atoms and less complex functional groups, tend to have lower property values. However, there are exceptions, and the presence of certain functional groups or elements seems to significantly impact the property value.

## Step 3: Examining the impact of specific functional groups and elements
Molecules containing nitro groups (N(=O)=O), like Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 with a value of 668.59217109, and molecules with complex ring systems and multiple oxygen and nitrogen atoms, like OC(Cn1cncn1)(c2ccc(F)cc2)c3ccccc3F with a value of 631.91833892, tend to have higher property values. On the other hand, simpler hydrocarbons and molecules with fewer functional groups, such as Clc1ccccc1 with a value of -674.49075948, tend to have lower property values.

## Step 4: Predicting the property for the given molecule
The molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 contains a complex ring structure with multiple nitrogen and oxygen atoms, including a nitro group. Given the presence of these functional groups and the complexity of the molecule, it is likely to have a higher property value compared to simpler molecules.

## Step 5: Comparing with similar molecules
Comparing the given molecule to others with similar functional groups and complexity, such as COc2ccc(Oc1ccc(NC(=O)N(C)C)cc1)cc2 with a value of 628.32789381, suggests that the property value for O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 could be in a similar range, considering the presence of the nitro group and the complex ring structure.

The final answer is: $\boxed{391.61497708}$

Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -57.44712171967964
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, let's analyze the provided examples to identify any patterns or correlations between molecular structures and their corresponding property values.

1. **Observation of Known Molecules**:
   - Many molecules with complex structures and multiple rings, especially those containing nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, tend to have higher property values (e.g., O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)C(C)C with a value of 1255.88640652).
   - Molecules with simpler structures, such as linear or small ring systems without many functional groups, often have lower property values (e.g., CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC with a value of -674.49075948).
   - Aromatic rings (like benzene rings) are common in many of these molecules, and their presence alone does not seem to significantly increase the property value unless they are part of a larger, more complex structure.

2. **Analysis of the Given Molecule**:
   - The molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 consists of two benzene rings connected by a nitrogen atom, which is a relatively simple structure compared to many of the examples provided.
   - The presence of nitrogen directly connecting two aromatic rings might suggest some level of complexity, but it does not approach the complexity of molecules with multiple functional groups, large ring systems, or a variety of heteroatoms.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Given the relatively simple structure of the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 compared to those with high property values, and considering the presence of aromatic rings which are common in molecules with a wide range of property values, it's reasonable to predict that this molecule will have a property value more akin to simpler structures.
   - However, the exact value is difficult to predict without a clear understanding of how the property is calculated or what it represents. The molecule's structure suggests it might not be as low as -674.49075948 (the value for many simple hydrocarbons and halogenated benzenes) but could be closer to values seen for simpler aromatic compounds or those with a single functional group.

Given these considerations and looking at molecules like Nc1ccccc1 (-7.18089021) which has a single benzene ring with a nitrogen atom, and considering the doubling of the aromatic system in N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, a reasonable guess might place the property value somewhere between that of simple aromatics and more complex structures, potentially in the range of -100 to 500, considering the doubling of the aromatic system could increase the value but not to the extent of more complex molecules.

**Predicted Property Value**: Given the lack of specific guidance on how to calculate or estimate the property value based on molecular structure and without a clear formula or pattern from the examples, a precise prediction is challenging. However, based on the simplicity of the molecule compared to those with high values, a value of around **-7.18089021** (similar to Nc1ccccc1) or slightly higher due to the additional aromatic ring might be a reasonable estimate, but this is highly speculative without more information on the property being predicted.

Iteration: 50
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 1255.8864065235312
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we should analyze the provided examples to identify any patterns or correlations between molecular structures and their corresponding property values. However, without explicit information on what the property represents (e.g., energy, solubility, boiling point), we must rely on general chemical principles and observations from the given data.

1. **Observation of Patterns**: Looking at the examples, there doesn't seem to be a straightforward, simple correlation between the size of the molecule (number of atoms) and the property value. Some large molecules have high values, while others have low or negative values.

2. **Functional Groups**: Certain functional groups seem to influence the property value significantly. For instance, the presence of nitro groups (N(=O)=O) often correlates with higher property values, as seen in molecules like O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O with a value of 2644.61928202.

3. **Heterocycles and Rings**: Molecules containing heterocyclic rings or complex ring systems tend to have a wide range of property values. The specific arrangement of atoms within these rings and the types of heteroatoms present (e.g., N, O, S) may significantly affect the property.

4. **Aliphatic Chains**: Long aliphatic chains (like in CCCCCC(C)C) often have negative or low property values, suggesting that these chains might contribute less to the property in question compared to more complex or functionalized structures.

Given the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we observe:
- It contains a heterocyclic ring structure with nitrogen and oxygen atoms, which could imply a moderate to high property value based on the presence of such functional groups in other examples.
- The ring is fused with a cycloalkane (CCCC1), which might contribute a relatively stable or neutral component to the property value.
- There are no highly electronegative or reactive groups like nitro or halogens attached directly to the ring system, which might otherwise significantly increase the property value.

**Prediction**:
Based on the structure and comparing it with similar molecules in the dataset, such as C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1 with a value of 901.20172198, which also contains a heterocyclic ring with carbonyl groups, we might expect the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 to be in a moderate range, potentially positive but not as high as molecules with multiple nitro groups or very complex ring systems.

Given the lack of direct comparables and the complexity of predicting chemical properties without a clear understanding of what the property represents, a precise prediction is challenging. However, if forced to estimate based on the patterns observed, a value in the range of 700 to 1000 might be reasonable, considering the molecule's structure and the values of similar compounds in the dataset.

**Predicted Property Value**: Approximately 850.0

This prediction is highly speculative and based on very general observations from the provided dataset. The actual property value could significantly differ based on the specific chemical property being predicted and the nuances of molecular interactions and effects not immediately apparent from the structure alone.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, let's analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or similar structures that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Similar Structures**: Looking at the examples, molecules with similar structures or functional groups tend to have property values that are closer in value. For instance, molecules with chlorine (Cl) substitutions on benzene rings or similar hydrocarbon backbones often have negative property values.

2. **Chlorine Substitution**: Molecules with chlorine substitutions, such as Clc1ccccc1Cl (dichlorobenzene), have a property value of -674.49075948. The presence of chlorine atoms tends to contribute to negative property values, possibly due to the electronegativity of chlorine and its effect on the molecular structure.

3. **Benzene Rings and Substitutions**: The given molecule has two benzene rings with chlorine substitutions. The property values for molecules with benzene rings and various substitutions range widely, but those with halogen substitutions (like chlorine) tend to have negative values.

4. **Comparison with Known Molecules**: The molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl can be seen as a combination of two chlorinated benzene rings. Given that Clc1ccccc1Cl has a property value of -674.49075948, and considering the additional chlorinated benzene ring in the given molecule, it might be expected to have a property value that reflects the combined effect of these chlorinated rings.

Given these considerations, and without a clear, specific formula to apply from the provided examples, a reasonable prediction might lean towards a negative value, considering the chlorinated nature of the molecule and its structural similarity to other chlorinated compounds listed. However, the exact value would depend on the specific property being predicted and how it is influenced by the molecular structure.

Since the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is essentially a dichlorobiphenyl, and considering the property values provided for similar chlorinated aromatic compounds, a predicted property value could be around -674.49075948, considering the additive effect of the chlorines and the biphenyl structure. However, this is a rough estimate based on pattern recognition and the assumption that the property in question is influenced by halogenation and aromaticity in a somewhat predictable manner.

**Predicted Property Value**: -674.49075948

This prediction is based on the assumption that the property value is negatively influenced by the presence of chlorine atoms on the benzene rings and that the biphenyl structure does not drastically alter this influence in a way that would significantly deviate from the observed values for simpler chlorinated aromatics.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we need to analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or similarities that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Molecular Structure and Functional Groups**: The property seems to be related to the molecular structure, including the types of atoms, bonds, and functional groups present. For instance, molecules with more complex structures, multiple rings, and specific functional groups like nitro (-NO2), sulfone (-SO2-), or carbonyl (C=O) groups tend to have higher property values.

2. **Ring Systems and Aromaticity**: Aromatic rings, especially when substituted with other groups, seem to influence the property value significantly. The presence of multiple rings or fused ring systems also appears to increase the property value.

3. **Aliphatic Chains**: Longer aliphatic chains seem to decrease the property value or have a less significant impact compared to aromatic systems or specific functional groups.

Given the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, it consists of an aromatic ring (phenyl group) with an ethyl group (CC) attached. This structure is relatively simple compared to some of the examples provided.

**Comparison with Similar Structures**:
- The molecule C=CC=O has a property value of -236.71291673, indicating that simple, unsaturated compounds with a carbonyl group have negative values.
- The molecule CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1 has a property value of -236.71291673, showing that even with an additional ring and more carbon atoms, the presence of a carbonyl group and an alkene keeps the value negative.
- The molecule Cc1ccccc1N has a property value of -7.18089021, which is closer to zero and has an aromatic ring with an amino group, suggesting that the absence of strong electron-withdrawing or donating groups results in a less negative value.

**Prediction**:
Given the structure CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, which is essentially a phenyl ring with an ethyl group attached, and comparing it with the provided examples, we can infer that its property value would likely be negative due to the presence of an aromatic ring without strong electron-withdrawing groups. However, the exact value is difficult to predict without a clear understanding of how each functional group or structural element contributes to the property.

Considering the simplicity of the molecule and the absence of strong functional groups that significantly alter the property value, a reasonable estimate might place its value somewhere between that of simple aromatic compounds and aliphatic chains, potentially closer to the less negative end of the spectrum due to the lack of strong electron-withdrawing groups.

**Estimated Property Value**: Given the comparisons and the nature of the molecule, a predicted property value could be around -150 to -200, considering it's a relatively simple aromatic compound with an alkyl substituent. However, without a precise formula or more detailed understanding of the property, this is a rough estimate based on pattern recognition and comparison with the provided examples.

Therefore, a predicted specific property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 could be approximately **-174.49075948**, aligning with the values of similar structures and considering the presence of an aromatic ring and an ethyl substituent.

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 1535.6846645421494
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, let's analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or similar structures that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Nitro Groups (-N(=O)=O)**: Molecules with nitro groups tend to have higher property values. For example, Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O has a value of 1538.24926819, and Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a value of 1099.18912362. The presence of a nitro group significantly increases the property value.

2. **Sulfonamide Group (S(N)(=O)=O)**: The molecule in question contains a sulfonamide group, which is similar to a nitro group but with a sulfur atom instead. This group is known for its high electronegativity and ability to withdraw electrons, which could influence the molecular property.

3. **Aromatic Rings**: The presence of aromatic rings, as seen in the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, generally contributes to higher property values due to their stability and electron delocalization.

Given these observations, we can make an educated guess about the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O. Since it contains both an aromatic ring and a sulfonamide group, which is analogous to a nitro group in terms of electron withdrawal but attached to a sulfur, its property value is likely to be significant.

Comparing with the provided examples:
- The nitro-containing compounds have high values (e.g., 1099.18912362 for Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O).
- The presence of sulfur in a similar position (as in sulfonamides) might alter the value but is likely to keep it in a similar range due to sulfur's larger size and lower electronegativity compared to nitrogen, potentially reducing the electron-withdrawing effect slightly.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O might be slightly lower than that of its nitro analogue due to the differences in electronegativity and size between sulfur and nitrogen, but still within the same order of magnitude.

Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 900-1000, considering the sulfonamide group's influence and the aromatic ring's contribution. However, without a clear pattern or a direct analogue, this prediction involves significant uncertainty.

Predicted property value: Approximately 950.

To predict the property for the given molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, we need to analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their corresponding property values.

Upon examining the examples, it's noticeable that many molecules with complex ring structures and multiple fused rings tend to have a property value of -674.49075948. This value seems to be associated with a wide variety of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other compounds with extensive ring systems.

Given the structure of the molecule in question, c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, it appears to be a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with multiple fused rings, similar to other molecules in the examples that have the property value of -674.49075948.

Based on this observation and the structural similarity to other molecules with the same property value, the predicted property value for the molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 would be -674.49075948.

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 2075.277272123426
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their corresponding property values.

Upon examining the examples, it's clear that the property values are not directly related to simple molecular properties like molecular weight or the number of atoms. The values seem to be related to the specific arrangement of atoms and functional groups within the molecules.

One approach to predicting the property value for the given molecule is to look for similar molecular structures among the examples and use their property values as a reference. The given molecule contains several functional groups, including hydroxyl (-OH), carbonyl (C=O), and ether (C-O-C) groups, which are also present in some of the example molecules.

For instance, the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl has a property value of 505.48337906, and it contains a combination of hydroxyl, carbonyl, and aromatic rings. Another example, Oc1cccc(O)c1, has a property value of 363.14787659 and contains hydroxyl and aromatic ring groups.

Given the presence of similar functional groups in the given molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we can make an educated prediction of its property value. The molecule has a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups, which suggests that its property value might be closer to those of the more complex molecules in the examples.

Based on the patterns observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 would be around 673.97783875, considering the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, a carbonyl group, and aromatic rings, which are similar to the functional groups found in molecules with property values in this range.

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 746.2996616261946
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding property values shows a wide range of chemical structures and associated values. To predict the property for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we need to look for patterns or similarities between the given molecules and the target molecule.

## Step 2: Identifying key functional groups and their effects on the property
Certain functional groups tend to have specific effects on the property value. For example, the presence of halogens (like Cl or Br), the number and type of carbon chains, and the presence of specific heteroatoms (like N, O, S, P) can influence the property value. We need to identify these groups in the given molecules and compare them with the target molecule.

## Step 3: Comparing the target molecule with similar molecules
The target molecule, COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, contains a phosphate group (P=O), an amide group (NC=O), and a thioether group (SC). We should look for molecules in the given list that contain similar functional groups to establish a basis for prediction.

## Step 4: Establishing a basis for prediction
Molecules like COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl and COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl contain phosphate or phosphorothioate groups and have property values of 35.64799071 and 473.42583346, respectively. The presence of the phosphate group and other functional groups like amides and thioethers in these molecules can help in predicting the property value for the target molecule.

## Step 5: Predicting the property value for the target molecule
Given the complexity of the molecule and the variety of functional groups present, the property value is likely to be influenced by the combination of these groups. The phosphate group, the amide group, and the thioether group all contribute to the overall property value. By comparing with similar molecules and considering the effects of these functional groups, we can make an educated prediction.

The final answer is: $\boxed{319.80607493}$

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, let's analyze the given examples and look for patterns or similar structures that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Analyzing the Structure**: The molecule given is Cl\C=C/Cl, which is dichloroethene. This molecule contains a carbon-carbon double bond and two chlorine atoms attached to the carbons of the double bond.

2. **Looking for Similarities**: Among the provided examples, there are molecules with chlorine atoms and double bonds, but none exactly match Cl\C=C/Cl. However, we can look at molecules with similar functional groups or structures to make an educated guess.

3. **Property Trend Observation**:
   - Molecules with chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values (e.g., CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a value of 71.80890215).
   - Alkenes (molecules with a carbon-carbon double bond) like CCC(=C)C have a property value of -674.49075948, suggesting that the presence of a double bond might not significantly increase the property value on its own.
   - The effect of chlorine substitution can vary widely depending on the rest of the molecule.

4. **Prediction**: Given the information and the fact that Cl\C=C/Cl is a relatively simple molecule with a double bond and two chlorine atoms, we might expect its property value to be somewhat higher than that of a simple alkene due to the chlorine atoms but not excessively high since it lacks complex rings or multiple functional groups that tend to increase the property value in the examples provided.

5. **Estimation**: Without a clear, direct comparison, the prediction involves significant uncertainty. However, considering the presence of chlorine atoms which can increase the value and the double bond, a rough estimate might place the property value somewhere between that of simple alkenes (around -674.49075948) and molecules with chlorine substitutions (which can have positive values or higher negative values depending on the structure).

Given the lack of direct comparability and the simplicity of the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, a cautious approach would be to estimate its property value as potentially being closer to the values of simpler molecules but acknowledging the influence of chlorine atoms. Thus, a very rough estimate might be around -200 to -300, considering it's a simple molecule with a double bond and chlorine atoms, but this is highly speculative without more direct comparisons.

**Predicted Property Value**: -269.53984343 (This value is chosen based on the structure's simplicity and the presence of a double bond and chlorine atoms, drawing a rough comparison with other molecules in the list that have some similar features, though it's acknowledged that this is a speculative estimate.)

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -343.91334922361756
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule c1ccncc1, let's analyze the given examples and look for patterns or similar structures that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Observation of Known Molecules**:
   - Many of the molecules with a property value of -674.49075948 contain aromatic rings (like benzene) or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Examples include Cc1cc(C)c2ccccc2c1, CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1, and c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4ccc5cccc2c5c43.
   - Molecules with a value of -155.67144145 often contain an alcohol group (-OH) attached to a carbon chain or an aromatic ring, such as CC(C)(C)CCO, CCC(C)(C)CO, and CCCCCC(C)O.
   - Compounds with values around 0 or positive (like 674.49075948, 391.61497708, 540.10552831) often contain functional groups that might contribute to higher molecular weights or specific electronic properties, such as esters, amides, or nitro groups.

2. **Analysis of the Given Molecule (c1ccncc1)**:
   - The molecule c1ccncc1 represents a pyridine ring, which is an aromatic heterocyclic compound. It's similar to benzene but with one carbon replaced by a nitrogen atom.
   - Given its structure, it doesn't fit directly into the categories of the molecules with the most common property values (-674.49075948 or -155.67144145) because it lacks the specific functional groups or ring systems seen in those examples.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Since pyridine (c1ccncc1) is an aromatic heterocycle and does not contain any of the specific functional groups that are commonly associated with the more negative or the positive property values in the examples, we might expect its property value to be somewhat distinct.
   - However, without a clear pattern or a similar molecule in the provided list, making an accurate prediction is challenging. Given the aromatic nature of pyridine and its simplicity compared to many of the other molecules listed, one might speculate that its property value could be more towards the negative side, considering the prevalence of aromatic compounds with negative values, but not as low as -674.49075948 due to its smaller size and simpler structure compared to many of those compounds.

Given these considerations and the lack of a direct analogue in the provided data, a precise prediction is difficult. However, if forced to estimate based on the aromatic nature and the general trend of simpler aromatic compounds, a value somewhat more negative than -365.9689406 (the value for CNc1ccccc1, an aromatic amine) but not as negative as the values for larger aromatic systems might be a reasonable guess. Thus, a speculative prediction could be around -300 to -400, acknowledging the significant uncertainty due to the lack of direct comparables.

**Predicted Property Value**: -365.9689406 (This value is chosen as a reference point due to the aromatic nature of the molecule and the presence of nitrogen, similar to CNc1ccccc1. However, the actual value could vary based on the specific property being predicted, which is not defined in the question.)

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 1676.7378651931479
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to analyze the structural components and their potential contributions to the property value based on the provided examples.

1. **Presence of Oxygen Atoms**: Molecules with multiple oxygen atoms, especially in the form of hydroxyl (-OH) or carbonyl (C=O) groups, tend to have higher property values. The given molecule contains several oxygen atoms, including hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, which could contribute to a higher property value.

2. **Aromatic Rings**: The presence of aromatic rings, as seen in the benzene rings (c1ccccc1) within the molecule, can influence the property value. Aromatic rings are known for their stability, which might contribute to a higher or more stable property value.

3. **Nitrogen and Chlorine Atoms**: The presence of nitrogen (N) and chlorine (Cl) atoms can also affect the property value. Nitrogen, especially in the form of amine or amide groups, can contribute to higher property values due to its ability to form hydrogen bonds or participate in conjugation. Chlorine, being a halogen, can influence the molecule's reactivity and stability.

4. **Comparison with Similar Structures**: Looking at the provided examples, molecules with complex structures that include multiple functional groups (like hydroxyl, carbonyl, and amine groups) and aromatic rings tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O has a high property value of 1637.49942938 due to its multiple hydroxyl groups and ring structure.

Given these considerations, the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 contains several features that could contribute to a higher property value, including multiple oxygen atoms, aromatic rings, and the presence of nitrogen and chlorine atoms. However, without a clear understanding of how these structural components quantitatively influence the property value, we must make an educated guess based on the patterns observed in the provided examples.

Considering the complexity and the types of functional groups present in the molecule, it seems reasonable to predict a property value that is significantly higher than those of simpler molecules but might not reach the highest values seen in the examples with extensive hydroxylation or very large, complex structures.

Given the information and the need to make a prediction, a reasonable approach would be to look for molecules in the provided list that share similar structural features and use their property values as a basis for prediction. However, without a direct analogue in the provided list, we must consider the general trends:

- Molecules with multiple functional groups and aromatic rings tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of halogens like chlorine can influence the property value, potentially increasing it due to the atom's size and reactivity.

Based on these trends and the complexity of the given molecule, a predicted property value could be estimated to be in the range of several hundred to over a thousand, considering the molecule's structural complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups and aromatic rings.

Given the specific examples and the structural components of the molecule in question, a predicted property value could be around 1000 to 1500, considering it has a combination of oxygen atoms, aromatic rings, and halogen atoms, which are features seen in molecules with higher property values in the provided list.

Therefore, a predicted specific property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 could be approximately 1200, acknowledging the presence of multiple functional groups, aromatic rings, and a halogen atom, which are indicative of a higher property value based on the trends observed in the provided examples.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -155.6714414457389
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule CCCCCO, we need to analyze the given examples and look for patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their corresponding property values.

Upon examining the examples, it appears that the property values are related to the molecular structure, but there is no clear or simple correlation. However, we can observe some general trends:

1. Molecules with more complex structures, such as those with multiple rings or functional groups, tend to have higher property values.
2. Molecules with halogen atoms (e.g., Cl, F, Br) tend to have lower property values.
3. Molecules with oxygen atoms tend to have higher property values.

The molecule CCCCCO has a relatively simple structure, with a single oxygen atom and a short chain of carbon atoms. Based on the trends observed in the examples, we might expect the property value for CCCCCO to be relatively low, but not extremely low due to the presence of the oxygen atom.

Considering the examples, we can see that molecules with similar structures, such as CCCCO (not shown) or CC(C)CC(C)(C)O (property value: -155.67144145), tend to have property values around -150 to -200. However, the presence of the oxygen atom in CCCCCO might increase the property value slightly.

Taking these factors into account, I predict the property value for CCCCCO to be around -100 to -150. A reasonable estimate, based on the patterns observed in the examples, would be:

-155.67144145

This value is similar to that of CC(C)CC(C)(C)O, considering the additional carbon atoms in CCCCCO might have a minor effect on the property value.

Another molecule, CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, has a property value of 1142.01800454. Although the property values are different, both molecules contain sulfonyl groups, which might indicate that the sulfonyl group contributes to the property value.

## Step 5: Considering the effect of other functional groups
In addition to the sulfonyl group, the given molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 also contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and an amide group (C(=O)N). The presence of these groups might influence the property value.

## Step 6: Predicting the property value
Based on the patterns observed in the given molecules and their properties, we can make an educated prediction for the property value of the given molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1. Considering the presence of the sulfonyl group and other functional groups, we might expect a property value that is somewhat similar to those of other sulfonyl-containing molecules.

## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding properties shows a wide range of chemical structures and property values. To predict the property for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to look for patterns or similarities between the structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in the data
Upon examining the data, it's noticeable that molecules with certain functional groups or structural features tend to have similar property values. For example, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms (e.g., Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl) have a property value of -674.49075948, suggesting that the presence of chlorine atoms may be associated with this specific property value.

One of the molecules in the list, CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3ccccc23, has a property value of -70.52660033 and features an amide group. Another molecule, OC2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23, has a property value of 750.40302746 and also contains an amide group. The presence of amide groups in these molecules suggests that this functional group may influence the property value.

## Step 5: Predicting the property value
Given the presence of amide groups in the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 and the property values associated with similar molecules, it's reasonable to predict that the property value for this molecule will be closer to those of molecules with amide groups. However, without a clear pattern or direct comparison, the prediction will involve some uncertainty.

## Step 6: Making an educated guess
Based on the information provided and the analysis of structural features, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 might be a value that is not extreme (i.e., not close to the highest or lowest values in the list) and could potentially be near zero or a moderate positive or negative value, considering the diversity of property values associated with amide-containing molecules.

True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule ClCC, we need to analyze the given examples and look for patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their corresponding property values.

Upon examining the examples, it appears that the property values are related to the molecular structure, but there is no clear, simple mathematical relationship. However, we can observe some trends:

1. Many molecules with a similar structure (e.g., a benzene ring or a cyclohexane ring) have similar property values, often around -674.49075948.
2. Molecules with more complex structures, such as those with multiple rings or functional groups, tend to have higher property values.
3. The presence of certain functional groups, like carbonyl (C=O) or sulfonyl (S=O), seems to increase the property value.

Given the molecule ClCC, we can see that it has a simple structure, similar to some of the examples with property values around -674.49075948. However, the presence of the chlorine atom (Cl) might affect the property value.

Based on these observations, I predict that the property value for the molecule ClCC will be close to -674.49075948, but possibly slightly different due to the presence of the chlorine atom.

My predicted property value for ClCC is: -674.49075948

Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule CCCCC(C)O, we need to analyze the given examples and look for patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their corresponding property values.

Upon examining the examples, it appears that the property value is related to the molecular structure, but there is no clear, simple mathematical relationship based on the information provided. However, we can observe some trends:

1. **Molecules with Similar Structures Have Similar Property Values**: Molecules that are structurally similar or have similar functional groups tend to have property values that are closer in value. For example, molecules with long alkyl chains and certain functional groups like esters or amides tend to have positive property values, while simpler hydrocarbons and halogenated compounds tend to have a property value of -674.49075948.

2. **Presence of Certain Functional Groups**: The presence of certain functional groups seems to significantly affect the property value. For instance, molecules containing ester, amide, or nitrile groups often have positive property values, while those with only alkyl chains or halogens tend to have the aforementioned negative value.

3. **Complexity and Size of the Molecule**: Larger, more complex molecules with multiple rings or functional groups tend to have higher property values, especially if they contain groups like amides, esters, or aromatic rings.

Given the molecule CCCCC(C)O, which is an alcohol with an alkyl chain, we can make an educated guess based on the trends observed:

- The molecule is relatively simple and contains an alcohol group, which is a polar functional group.
- There are examples of molecules with alcohol groups (like CC(O)c1ccccc1, -155.67144145, and CCC(C)CCO, -155.67144145) that have a property value of -155.67144145.

Based on these observations, it seems reasonable to predict that the property value for the molecule CCCCC(C)O would be similar to that of other alcohols with alkyl chains, which is -155.67144145.

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1, let's analyze the given examples and look for patterns or similar structures that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Similar Structures**: The molecule in question, Brc1ccc(Br)cc1, is a brominated benzene, specifically 1,4-dibromobenzene. Looking through the provided examples, we can find molecules with similar structures or functional groups that might help in predicting the property.

2. **Bromination Effect**: Bromine is a halogen, and its presence on a benzene ring can significantly affect the physical and chemical properties of the compound. In the examples, molecules with chlorine (another halogen) substitutions on benzene rings often have property values around -674.49075948. This suggests that halogenation might lead to a specific range of property values.

3. **Property Value Patterns**: Observing the provided data, it seems that many compounds with a benzene ring and halogen substitutions (like chlorine) have a property value of approximately -674.49075948. This includes compounds like ClCCl, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl, and c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1, among others.

Given these observations, and considering the molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is a halogenated benzene (with bromine instead of chlorine), it's reasonable to hypothesize that its property value might be similar to those of the chlorinated benzenes, assuming the property in question does not significantly differentiate between chlorine and bromine in terms of its effect on the molecular structure or the specific property being measured.

**Prediction**: Based on the pattern observed with halogenated benzenes, the predicted property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 could be around -674.49075948, similar to the values observed for chlorinated benzene derivatives. However, without a clear understanding of the property being predicted (e.g., energy, reactivity, boiling point), this prediction is based on the assumption that the property behaves similarly across different halogens on a benzene ring.

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 473.42583345771675
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding property values shows a wide range of chemical structures and values. To predict the property for the given molecule Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1, we need to identify any patterns or correlations between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in the molecular structures
Upon examining the molecules, it's noticeable that many of them contain common functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), carbonyl (C=O), and aromatic rings. The presence of these groups often influences the physical and chemical properties of the molecules.

## Step 3: Looking for similar molecules in the given list
The molecule Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1 contains an aromatic ring, phosphate group (P=O), and ether linkages. We should look for molecules in the given list that have similar functional groups or structural features.

## Step 4: Comparing with similar molecules
One molecule that stands out with some similarity is CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 757.58391768. Although it's not identical, it shares the presence of a phosphate-like group (albeit with sulfur instead of oxygen) and an aromatic ring.

## Step 5: Considering the effects of functional groups
The phosphate group in the given molecule is likely to contribute significantly to its property value due to its high electronegativity and ability to form hydrogen bonds. The aromatic rings also play a role, but their effect might be more constant across different molecules.

## Step 6: Making an educated prediction
Given the complexity of the molecule and the presence of the phosphate group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group, and considering the values of molecules with similar functional groups, we can make an educated guess. The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O has a value of 757.58391768, but our molecule has oxygen instead of sulfur in the phosphate group, which could slightly increase the value due to oxygen's higher electronegativity. However, without a direct comparison, this is speculative.

## Step 7: Final prediction
Given the information and the process of elimination, predicting the exact property value is challenging without a clear pattern or a molecule with a very similar structure in the given list. However, considering the presence of the phosphate group and aromatic rings, and looking at the range of values provided, a value that reflects the influence of these groups would be reasonable.

The final answer is: $\boxed{201.06492602}$

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -153.61975852717887
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding property values shows a wide range of chemical structures and values. To predict the property for the given molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to look for patterns or correlations between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in the molecular structures
Upon examining the molecules, it's noticeable that many of them contain common functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), carbonyl (C=O), and nitro (-NO2) groups, which can significantly influence the physical and chemical properties of the molecules. However, without a clear understanding of the property being predicted, we must rely on general chemical principles.

## Step 3: Considering the effect of fluorine and chlorine substituents
The molecule in question contains fluorine and chlorine atoms, which are known to affect the physical and chemical properties of molecules due to their electronegativity and ability to participate in intermolecular forces. The presence of these halogens can increase the polarity of the molecule and potentially alter its boiling point, solubility, and reactivity.

## Step 4: Examining the molecular structure for potential clues
The molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O contains a trifluoromethyl group (CF3) attached to a benzene ring, which is connected to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle with chlorine substituents and a carbonyl group. This combination of functional groups suggests a molecule with significant polarity and potential for intermolecular interactions.

## Step 5: Making an educated prediction based on the patterns observed
Given the diversity of the molecules and their properties in the provided list, and without a clear indication of the property being predicted (such as boiling point, solubility, etc.), making a precise prediction is challenging. However, considering the presence of fluorine, chlorine, and the specific arrangement of functional groups in the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, it is likely that its property value will be influenced by the high electronegativity of the halogens and the polarity of the molecule.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 668.5921710857352
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding properties shows a wide range of chemical structures and property values. To predict the property for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we need to identify any patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in the molecular structures
Upon examining the molecules, we notice that many of them contain common functional groups such as hydroxyl (-OH), carbonyl (C=O), and nitro (-NO2) groups. The presence and arrangement of these functional groups seem to influence the property values.

## Step 3: Focusing on the nitro group
The molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O contains a nitro group (-NO2) attached to a benzene ring. We can look for other molecules in the list that also contain a nitro group to see if there's a correlation in their property values.

## Step 4: Comparing with similar molecules
One molecule that stands out is O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of 1538.24926819. Another molecule, Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, has a property value of -343.91334922, but it does not contain a nitro group. However, the molecule NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(N=CNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl has a property value of 2369.43731057 and contains a sulfonyl group, which is similar to the nitro group in terms of its electron-withdrawing properties.

## Step 5: Making an educated prediction
Based on the presence of the nitro group and the similarity in structure to other molecules with known property values, we can make an educated prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which tends to increase the property value. Considering the property values of similar molecules, a reasonable prediction for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around 400-500.

The final answer is: $\boxed{298.86158124}$

True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding property values shows a wide range of chemical structures and values. To predict the property for the given molecule ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to identify any patterns or correlations between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in the molecular structures
Upon examining the molecules, it's noticeable that many of them contain halogen atoms (such as Cl, Br, F), and some have specific functional groups like nitro (-NO2), carbonyl (C=O), or hydroxyl (OH). The presence and arrangement of these atoms and groups might influence the property value.

## Step 3: Looking for molecules with similar structures
The molecule ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl seems to be a chlorinated hydrocarbon, specifically a polychlorinated cycloalkane. We should look for similar molecules in the given list to establish a reference point for the prediction.

## Step 4: Finding reference molecules
Molecules like ClCCCl, ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, and CCCCCl have property values of -674.49075948, which suggests that chlorinated alkanes and cycloalkanes might have a specific range of property values.

## Step 5: Predicting the property value
Given the structure of the molecule ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl and the observed pattern that many chlorinated hydrocarbons have a property value around -674.49075948, we can make an educated prediction for its property value.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-674.49075948}$
==================================================
Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule CCCOC=O, let's analyze the given examples and look for patterns or similar structures that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Similar Structures**: Looking at the provided examples, there are molecules that contain similar functional groups or structures to CCCOC=O. For instance, molecules like CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, CCSC(=O)N(CC(C)C)CC(C)C, and CCNc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(SC)n1 contain ester or amide groups which are similar to the carbonyl group (C=O) in CCCOC=O.

2. **Functional Group Influence**: The presence of specific functional groups can significantly influence the property value. For example, molecules with halogens (like Cl or Br) tend to have lower property values (more negative), while molecules with complex ring structures or multiple functional groups tend to have higher property values.

3. **Chain Length and Branching**: The length of the carbon chain and the degree of branching can also affect the property value. Generally, longer chains or more branched molecules might have more positive property values due to increased molecular complexity and size.

Given these considerations, CCCOC=O has a relatively simple structure with an ether (C-O-C) and a carbonyl (C=O) group attached to a short carbon chain. This structure is somewhat similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, which has a property value of 667.30986926, but CCCOC=O lacks the aromatic ring and the nitrogen-containing group, which likely contribute to the higher property value of the former.

Another relevant example is CCSC(=O)N(CC(C)C)CC(C)C with a property value of -153.61975853, which contains a carbonyl group and sulfur and nitrogen atoms in its structure. However, the presence of sulfur and the specific arrangement of the carbon chain and branches in this molecule differentiate it significantly from CCCOC=O.

Considering the simplicity of CCCOC=O compared to most of the given molecules and the absence of complex rings or multiple functional groups, its property value is likely to be more negative, reflecting its relatively simple structure.

**Prediction**: Based on the analysis and considering the property values of similar structures, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be closer to the values of simpler molecules. Given the examples, a value around -155.67144145 seems plausible, as this value is associated with molecules that have a relatively simple structure and contain common functional groups like the hydroxyl or carbonyl group attached to a carbon chain.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC=O is approximately **-155.67144145**.
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule CCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we need to analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or similarities that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Analyzing the Examples**: The examples provided include a wide range of organic compounds with varying functional groups such as alkanes, aromatics, halogenated compounds, esters, amides, and more. The property values range significantly, from negative to positive values, indicating that the property could be related to energy (possibly enthalpy of formation or a similar thermodynamic property) given the context of molecular structures and their associated numerical values.

2. **Identifying Patterns**: 
   - **Alkanes and Simple Hydrocarbons**: Compounds like CC, CCCC, and CCC1CCCCC1 have a property value of -674.49075948, suggesting that simple hydrocarbons or alkanes might have a consistent or predictable property value based on their structure or molecular weight.
   - **Halogenated Compounds**: Halogenated aromatics and aliphatics tend to have negative property values, similar to or more negative than simple hydrocarbons.
   - **Esters and Amides**: These compounds often have positive property values, which could indicate that the presence of these functional groups contributes to an increase in the property value, possibly due to the energy associated with these functional groups.

3. **Predicting the Property for CCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC**:
   - The given molecule is an ester, with the general formula R-COO-R', where R and R' are alkyl groups. Esters typically have positive property values in the provided dataset.
   - Considering the molecule CCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, it has a long alkyl chain attached to an ester functional group. The length of the alkyl chain could contribute to the property value, potentially increasing it due to the increased molecular weight and the energy associated with the ester linkage.

Given these observations and without a clear, direct formula to apply from the examples, we can make an educated guess based on the patterns observed:

- The molecule in question is an ester with a long alkyl chain, which might suggest a positive property value.
- Comparing with other esters or similar compounds in the dataset, such as CCCOC (-437.77784275) or CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C (1077.38999261), the property value could be expected to be positive but might not be as high as complex molecules with multiple functional groups.

**Prediction**:
Given the lack of a direct correlation or formula and based on the patterns observed, a reasonable estimate for the property value of CCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC could be in the range of a few hundred to over a thousand, considering it's an ester and the general trend of esters in the dataset. However, without a more precise method of prediction or additional information about how the property values are calculated, this remains a rough estimate.

For the purpose of this exercise and based on the observed trends, let's predict a property value that reflects the presence of an ester group and a significant alkyl chain, which might place it in a moderate to higher range among the provided examples, but without exceeding the values of more complex molecules.

**Predicted Property Value**: 500.0

This prediction is highly speculative and based on general observations from the dataset. The actual property value could vary significantly based on the specific property being predicted and the underlying chemistry or physics involved.

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1696.998234013928
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given molecules and their corresponding properties show a wide range of values, from negative to positive, indicating that the property might be related to the molecular structure, possibly related to energy or stability.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns or correlations
Looking at the molecules, it seems that the presence of certain functional groups or elements (like Cl, N, O) and their positions can significantly affect the property value. For example, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms or specific arrangements of nitrogen and oxygen atoms tend to have higher property values.

## Step 3: Examining the molecule to predict
The molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O contains several functional groups that could influence its property value, including chlorine atoms, a carbonyl group (C=O), and a nitro group (N(=O)=O).

## Step 4: Comparing with similar molecules
Comparing the given molecule with others that have similar functional groups can help in predicting its property. For instance, the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2 has a property value of 391.61497708, and the molecule ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a value of -674.49075948. The presence of chlorine and nitro groups in the molecule to predict suggests it might have a positive property value due to the energy contributions of these groups.

## Step 5: Predicting the property value
Given the complexity of the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O and the presence of energy-contributing groups like chlorine and the nitro group, it's reasonable to predict that its property value will be positive and possibly of a magnitude similar to or higher than molecules with fewer such groups.

## Step 6: Estimating based on similar structures
Molecules like CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1nc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl with a value of 366.22540096 and Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O with a value of 431.87925436 suggest that the combination of chlorine atoms and a nitro group can lead to property values in the range of a few hundred. However, the specific arrangement and the presence of the carbonyl group and additional aromatic rings could increase this value.

## Step 7: Final prediction
Considering the presence of multiple chlorine atoms, a nitro group, and a carbonyl group attached to aromatic rings, the predicted property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O is likely to be positive and could be in the range of 800-1200, given the contributions of these functional groups to the molecular energy or stability.

The final answer is: $\boxed{834.12329064}$

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 745.786740896555
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding properties shows a wide range of chemical structures and property values. To predict the property for the given molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to identify any patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in the molecular structures
Upon examining the molecules, it's noticeable that many of them contain common functional groups such as hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCC, C=C), aromatic rings (e.g., c1ccccc1), and halogens (e.g., Cl). The presence of these groups seems to influence the property values, with hydrocarbons and aromatic rings often having negative property values and molecules with specific functional groups like COP(=S)(OC) having positive values.

## Step 3: Focusing on the phosphorus-containing molecules
The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 contains phosphorus, which is also present in the molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 319.80607493. This suggests that phosphorus-containing compounds might have distinct property values compared to hydrocarbons or aromatic rings.

## Step 4: Predicting the property value for the given molecule
Given the presence of phosphorus and the similarity in structure to COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, it's reasonable to assume that the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 might be closer to the values of other phosphorus-containing compounds. However, without a clear pattern or a direct analogue, the prediction relies on the understanding that this molecule, due to its complexity and the presence of phosphorus and sulfur, is likely to have a positive property value, potentially in the range of other complex molecules with similar functional groups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{319.80607493}$

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 950.6985723877332
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, let's analyze the given examples and look for patterns or similar structures that could help in estimation.

1. **Similar Structures**: Looking at the examples provided, we can see various functional groups and their effects on the property value. For instance, molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) attached to aromatic rings, like Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, can be compared to other nitro-aromatic compounds.

2. **Nitro Group Influence**: The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which can significantly affect the molecular properties. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups attached to aromatic rings or other structures show a wide range of property values, indicating that the nitro group's effect can vary based on the molecule's overall structure.

3. **Aromatic Rings**: The presence of aromatic rings also influences the property value. Molecules with multiple aromatic rings or complex ring systems tend to have higher property values compared to those with simpler structures.

Given these considerations, let's look for a molecule in the examples that closely resembles Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O. One such molecule is Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which has a predicted property value of 431.87925436. This molecule differs from the target molecule only by the presence of an oxygen atom (O) attached to the aromatic ring in the target molecule.

Considering the addition of an oxygen atom to the aromatic ring might slightly increase the property value due to the increased electron density and potential for additional interactions, we can estimate the property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O to be somewhat higher than that of Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O. However, without a clear pattern of how oxygen substitution on the ring affects the property value across the examples, this estimation involves some uncertainty.

Given the information and the need for a prediction, a reasonable approach would be to consider the property value of similar molecules and adjust based on the differences. Since the exact effect of the oxygen atom in this context is not clearly defined by the examples, we might predict the property value to be in the same general range as similar nitro-aromatic compounds, potentially slightly higher due to the oxygen's presence.

Therefore, based on the molecule Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O having a property value of 431.87925436, and considering the potential slight increase due to the oxygen atom, a predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O could be estimated to be around 450-500, acknowledging the uncertainty and the lack of a clear oxygen-effect pattern in the provided examples.

For the purpose of this prediction and without further detailed analysis or specific patterns to follow from the examples given, let's estimate the property value to be approximately **475**, keeping in mind that this is a rough estimation based on limited comparison and the potential effects of functional groups on the molecular property.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, we need to analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their corresponding property values.

Upon examining the examples, it's clear that the property values are related to the molecular structures, but the exact relationship is not straightforward due to the complexity of the molecules and the property in question. However, we can observe some general trends:

1. **Molecular Size and Complexity**: Larger, more complex molecules tend to have higher property values. This is evident from molecules like CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO with a value of 1757.52288011 and NC(N)=NC#N with a value of 1587.23319787, which are both large and complex.

2. **Functional Groups**: The presence of certain functional groups seems to significantly impact the property value. For instance, molecules containing multiple carbonyl (C=O) groups, such as O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC with a value of 1255.88640652, tend to have higher property values.

3. **Ring Structures**: Molecules with ring structures, especially those with multiple rings or complex ring systems, often have higher property values. Examples include CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O with a value of 282.1064013 and CCOC2Oc1ccc(OS(C)(=O)=O)cc1C2(C)C with a value of 911.20367621.

Given the molecule OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, we can observe the following:

- It is a large molecule with a complex structure, indicating a potentially high property value.
- It contains multiple ether (O) and hydroxyl (OH) groups, which could contribute to its property value, though the exact impact is less clear from the examples.
- The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) within the structure could also contribute to a higher property value, based on the trend observed in the examples.

Considering these factors and looking at the provided examples, it's challenging to predict the exact property value without a clear, defined relationship between molecular structure and property value. However, based on the size, complexity, and functional groups present in the molecule, we might expect a relatively high property value, potentially in the range of larger, more complex molecules provided in the examples.

Given the complexity and the absence of a clear formula or pattern from the examples, a precise prediction is challenging. However, for the purpose of this exercise and based on the trends observed, a predicted property value could be estimated to be high, potentially above 1000, considering the molecule's size and complexity. A more precise prediction would require a deeper understanding of the property being measured and its relationship to molecular structure.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyze the given molecules and their properties
The given molecules are represented in SMILES notation, and their corresponding properties are provided. To predict the property for the molecule CCC#C, we need to identify any patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Look for similar molecules
We can start by looking for molecules with similar structures to CCC#C. One molecule that stands out is CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO, which has a property value of -155.67144145. However, this molecule is much larger than CCC#C.

## Step 3: Identify key functional groups
The molecule CCC#C contains an alkyne group (#C). We can look for other molecules that contain this functional group. One example is N#Cc1ccccc1C#N, which has a property value of 545.74765634. However, this molecule also contains other functional groups that may affect its property.

## Step 4: Consider the effect of the alkyne group
The alkyne group is a key feature of the molecule CCC#C. We can look for other molecules that contain this group and see if there is a consistent effect on the property. However, there are limited examples of molecules with this group in the provided data.

## Step 5: Look for molecules with similar carbon chain lengths
The molecule CCC#C has a short carbon chain. We can look for other molecules with similar chain lengths and see if there is a pattern in their properties. One example is CCC(C)C(=O)C, which has a property value of -236.71291673.

## Step 6: Consider the overall structure
The molecule CCC#C has a simple, linear structure. We can look for other molecules with similar structures and see if there is a pattern in their properties. However, the provided data does not contain many examples of simple, linear molecules with similar chain lengths.

## Step 7: Make an educated estimate
Based on the analysis of similar molecules and functional groups, we can make an educated estimate of the property value for CCC#C. Since the molecule contains an alkyne group and has a short carbon chain, its property value is likely to be different from molecules with longer chains or different functional groups.

The final answer is: $\boxed{268.39289322}$

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: -201.06492601887857
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we need to analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or similarities that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Molecular Complexity and Size**: Larger, more complex molecules tend to have higher property values. The given molecule is moderately complex, containing sulfur, phosphorus, chlorine, and oxygen, in addition to carbon and hydrogen.

2. **Functional Groups**: Certain functional groups contribute significantly to the property value. For example, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms, as in the given molecule, often increases the property value due to their electronegativity and size.

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**: Looking at the examples provided, molecules with chlorine atoms and complex ring structures tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -674.49075948, but this is a simpler structure compared to the one we are predicting for.

4. **Phosphorus and Sulfur Containing Molecules**: Molecules containing phosphorus and sulfur, like COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 319.80607493, suggest that these elements can contribute to a higher property value, especially when part of a more complex structure.

Given these observations, the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl combines elements of complexity, such as the phosphorus-sulfur bond and multiple chlorine substitutions on a benzene ring, which are indicative of a higher property value compared to simpler hydrocarbons or molecules without these functional groups.

However, without a clear, quantifiable relationship between molecular structure and property value from the provided examples, the prediction must be based on the general trends observed:

- The presence of chlorine atoms tends to increase the property value.
- Phosphorus and sulfur-containing compounds can have significant property values.
- The complexity and size of the molecule also play a role.

Considering the molecule in question has a combination of these factors (chlorine atoms, phosphorus, sulfur, and a moderate size), its property value is likely to be positive and possibly in the range of other complex molecules with similar functional groups.

Given the information and the need for a numerical prediction, a reasonable estimate, based on the patterns observed and without a specific formula to apply, would place the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl in the range of several hundred, potentially closer to values seen for other complex, halogenated molecules. However, the exact value is difficult to predict without more specific trends or a model to apply.

Therefore, based on the general trends and the complexity of the molecule, a predicted property value could be around 400-700, considering it's more complex than some of the simpler molecules with lower values but might not reach the values of the most complex structures provided. 

For the purpose of this exercise and acknowledging the speculative nature of this prediction, let's estimate the property value to be approximately 550, keeping in mind that this is a rough estimate based on observed trends rather than a precise calculation.

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 1069.6961816642126
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or similarities that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Analyzing the Examples**: The examples given include a wide variety of organic compounds with different functional groups and structures. The property values range significantly, from negative values (e.g., -674.49075948) to positive values (e.g., 3164.20798115). This wide range suggests that the property could be related to energy or a thermodynamic parameter, given the diversity of values.

2. **Identifying Patterns**: 
   - Many molecules with simple hydrocarbon chains or basic aromatic rings have a property value of -674.49075948. This suggests that this value might be associated with a baseline or a common reference state for many organic compounds.
   - Compounds with more complex structures, additional functional groups (like carbonyl, nitro, or sulfone groups), or those indicating potential for significant intermolecular interactions (like hydrogen bonding) tend to have more varied and often positive property values. This could imply that the property is influenced by the molecular complexity, polarity, or the ability to form intermolecular interactions.

3. **Analyzing the Target Molecule**: The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 contains a pyridine ring (indicated by "nccc") and a carbonyl group attached to two nitrogen atoms, suggesting the presence of an amide or a related functional group. The presence of nitrogen atoms in the ring and the carbonyl group attached to nitrogen atoms could facilitate hydrogen bonding or other intermolecular interactions, potentially influencing the property value.

4. **Prediction**: Given the presence of a pyridine ring and a functional group that could participate in intermolecular interactions, it's reasonable to expect that the property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 might be different from the baseline -674.49075948 seen for simpler hydrocarbons. However, without a clear pattern or a direct analogue in the provided examples, the prediction must be somewhat speculative.

Considering the influence of functional groups and molecular complexity on the property values in the examples, a positive value might be expected due to the potential for intermolecular interactions and the presence of polar functional groups. However, the exact value is difficult to predict without more specific information about how different functional groups and structural features quantitatively influence the property.

Given the lack of direct analogues and the complexity of predicting thermodynamic or energetic properties based solely on molecular structure without explicit calculation or more detailed patterns, a precise prediction is challenging. Nonetheless, based on the tendency of more complex molecules with potential for significant intermolecular interactions to have positive property values, one might speculate that the value could be positive, potentially in the range of a few hundred, considering the molecule's structure and functional groups. However, this is a very rough estimate and should be treated with caution.

**Predicted Property Value**: Given the speculative nature of this prediction and the lack of a clear, direct analogue in the provided data, it's difficult to provide a precise number. The prediction would likely be a positive value, potentially in the range of 100 to 500, but this is highly speculative and based on very general trends observed in the provided examples.

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 319.8060749305378
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding properties shows a wide range of chemical structures and property values. To predict the property for the given molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to identify any patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in the molecular structures
Upon examining the given molecules, it's noticeable that many of them have property values of -674.49075948. These molecules include a variety of structures such as alkanes, alkyl halides, and aromatic compounds. This suggests that the property value of -674.49075948 might be associated with a specific type of molecular structure or functional group.

## Step 3: Examining the molecular structure of the given molecule
The molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C contains several functional groups, including an organophosphate group, a thioester group, and an amide group. The presence of these functional groups could potentially influence the property value of the molecule.

## Step 4: Comparing the given molecule to similar molecules
By comparing the given molecule to similar molecules in the list, we can look for patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their properties. For example, the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1 has a property value of 1142.01800454, which is significantly different from the value of -674.49075948. This suggests that the presence of certain functional groups or molecular features can substantially impact the property value.

## Step 5: Predicting the property value for the given molecule
Based on the analysis of the given molecules and their properties, it's challenging to establish a clear pattern or relationship that would allow for a precise prediction of the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C. However, considering the diversity of molecular structures and property values in the given list, it's possible that the property value for the given molecule could be unique and not simply a repetition of one of the common values like -674.49075948.

The final answer is: $\boxed{83.0931582}$

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I can analyze the molecular structures and identify patterns to predict the property value for the given molecule CCCCCCCC.

The molecule CCCCCCCC is an alkane, a saturated hydrocarbon with a chain of 8 carbon atoms. Looking at the examples, I notice that similar alkanes, such as CC(C)(C)CO, CC(C)CO, and CCC(C)C1(CC(Br)=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O, have property values around -155.67144145 or -674.49075948.

However, the property value seems to be more related to the molecular structure and functional groups present. For example, molecules with a similar chain length but different functional groups, such as CCC(C)C1(CC(Br)=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O, have different property values.

Considering the molecule CCCCCCCC has no functional groups and is a simple alkane, I would predict its property value to be closer to the values of other alkanes with similar chain lengths. Based on the pattern observed, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCC to be around -155.67144145 or -674.49075948.

Given the chain length and the absence of functional groups, I would lean towards the lower value, which is more consistent with other alkanes in the examples. Therefore, my predicted property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC is -155.67144145.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 800.9257193328543
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding properties shows a wide range of chemical structures and property values. To predict the property for the given molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to identify any patterns or correlations between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in molecular structures
Upon examining the molecules, it's clear that they vary significantly in terms of their functional groups, ring structures, and branching. However, without a specific algorithm or model to apply, we must rely on general chemical intuition and the information provided by the examples.

## Step 3: Considering the role of functional groups and rings
Functional groups and rings can significantly impact the physical and chemical properties of molecules. For instance, the presence of hydroxyl (-OH), carbonyl (C=O), and alkyl groups can influence the polarity, solubility, and reactivity of a molecule. The given molecule contains a complex ring structure with an alkyl group and a carbonyl group, which might contribute to its overall property value.

## Step 4: Examining the given molecule
The molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C contains a complex ring system with a carbonyl group and an alkyne group. The presence of these functional groups and the complexity of the ring system could imply a higher property value compared to simpler molecules.

## Step 5: Making an educated prediction
Given the complexity of the molecule and the presence of functional groups that can contribute to higher property values, we can make an educated prediction. However, without a clear pattern or a specific model to follow, this prediction will be based on general chemical principles and the range of values observed in the provided examples.

The final answer is: $\boxed{282.1064013}$

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 3450.161287923436
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding property values shows a wide range of chemical structures and property values. To predict the property value for the given molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, we need to look for patterns or correlations between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in molecular structures
Upon examining the given molecules, it's noticeable that many of them contain aromatic rings, halogens, and various functional groups such as alcohols, ethers, and carbonyls. The presence of these features seems to influence the property values, with certain patterns emerging. For instance, molecules with multiple aromatic rings and specific functional groups tend to have higher property values.

## Step 3: Examining the given molecule
The molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 contains several aromatic rings, ether linkages, and a carbonyl group. These features are similar to those found in molecules with higher property values in the given list.

## Step 4: Making a prediction based on patterns
Given the complexity of the molecule and the presence of multiple aromatic rings and functional groups, it is likely that its property value will be higher than those of simpler molecules. However, without a clear quantitative relationship between the molecular structure and the property value, the prediction must be based on the qualitative analysis of the molecular features.

## Step 5: Considering the range of property values
The property values in the given list range from negative to positive, with a wide distribution. Molecules with complex structures and multiple functional groups tend to have higher property values. The given molecule, with its complex structure and multiple aromatic rings, is likely to have a property value that reflects its complexity.

The final answer is: $\boxed{308.52181888}$

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -155.6714414457389
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we need to analyze the given examples and look for patterns or similarities.

The given molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to some of the molecules in the examples. Let's look at a few examples that have similar structures:

* Clc1ccccc1I has a property value of -674.49075948
* Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -674.49075948
* ClC=C has a property value of -674.49075948
* CCCCCL has a property value of -674.49075948

These examples suggest that molecules with a chlorine atom (Cl) attached to a carbon atom tend to have a property value of around -674.49075948.

Another example that is similar to the given molecule is Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of 950.69857239. However, this molecule has a nitro group (-N(=O)=O) instead of a chlorine atom.

Considering the similarity in structure between Oc1ccccc1Cl and the examples with a chlorine atom, it is likely that the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl will be close to -674.49075948.

Therefore, based on the given examples, the predicted property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is -674.49075948.

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 308.52181887845774
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the given molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, we need to analyze the provided examples and look for patterns or similarities that could help in estimating the property value.

Given the diversity of the molecules and their respective property values, it seems challenging to establish a straightforward correlation without additional context or a specific algorithm/model that relates molecular structures to the property in question. However, we can attempt to make an educated guess by considering the types of molecules and their property values provided in the examples.

1. **Observation of Property Values**: The property values range widely, from negative to positive, with some molecules having very large positive values (e.g., 4014.37409053 for a complex molecule) and others having a repeating negative value of -674.49075948 for a variety of structurally different molecules.

2. **Molecular Complexity and Property Value**: There seems to be a trend where more complex molecules (in terms of the number of rings, functional groups, and atoms) tend to have larger property values, either positive or negative. However, this is not a strict rule, as some simpler molecules also have significant property values.

3. **Specific Functional Groups and Property Value**: Certain functional groups or molecular features seem to be associated with specific property values. For example, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms and complex ring systems tend to have negative property values, while molecules with extensive ring systems and multiple functional groups (like esters, amides) tend to have larger positive property values.

Given the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, we observe:
- It contains a chlorine atom, which is often associated with negative property values in the examples.
- It has an alkyne group (CC#CC), which is less common in the provided examples but could contribute to a unique property value.
- The presence of an ester or amide group (OC(=O)N) could suggest a positive contribution to the property value, given the trends in the examples.
- The aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent (c1cccc(Cl)c1) is similar to parts of molecules that have negative property values.

Without a clear algorithm or model, predicting the exact property value is speculative. However, considering the mix of features that might both increase and decrease the property value, a reasonable guess might lean towards a negative value due to the presence of chlorine atoms and the aromatic ring, but not as low as -674.49075948 due to the presence of the alkyne and amide functionalities which might increase the value.

Given the information and attempting to make an educated guess based on the patterns observed:
- The molecule has features that could both increase and decrease its property value.
- The presence of chlorine and aromatic rings might suggest a negative value, but the specific value is hard to predict without more context.

A speculative prediction, considering the molecule's complexity and functional groups, might place its property value in a range that reflects the influence of both its aromatic and alkyne components, as well as the amide group. However, without a clear pattern or a model to apply, this prediction is highly uncertain.

Given the constraints and the need for a numerical answer, and considering that many molecules with diverse structures have a property value of -674.49075948, but acknowledging the unique features of the given molecule, a very speculative and uncertain prediction could be somewhere in the negative range, potentially closer to -500 to -600, reflecting a balance between the potentially positive contributing groups and the negative contributing chlorine and aromatic structures. However, this is a highly speculative guess and should be treated with caution.

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 505.4833790602166
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding property values shows a wide range of chemical structures and values. To predict the property for the given molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to identify any patterns or correlations between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns in the molecular structures
Upon examining the molecules, it's noticeable that many of them contain aromatic rings, halogens (like chlorine and bromine), and various functional groups such as carbonyl, hydroxyl, and amino groups. The presence of these features seems to influence the property values significantly.

## Step 3: Observing the effect of halogens on the property
Molecules containing halogens, especially chlorine and bromine, tend to have lower property values, often around -674.49075948. This suggests that the presence of halogens might be associated with a specific range of property values.

## Step 4: Considering the impact of aromatic rings and functional groups
Aromatic rings and certain functional groups appear to contribute to higher property values. For instance, molecules with multiple aromatic rings or specific functional groups like carbonyl and amino groups tend to have higher property values.

## Step 5: Analyzing the given molecule
The molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl contains an aromatic ring, a chlorine atom, and what appears to be a pyridine ring (c2cncnc2). The combination of these features might place its property value within a certain range.

## Step 6: Making a prediction based on observed patterns
Given the presence of an aromatic ring, a chlorine atom, and a pyridine ring in the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, and considering the patterns observed in the given list of molecules, it seems reasonable to predict that its property value would be closer to the values of molecules with similar structural features.

## Step 7: Final prediction
Based on the patterns observed and the structural features of the given molecule, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be around -674.49075948, considering the influence of the chlorine atom and the aromatic rings. However, the presence of the pyridine ring and the specific arrangement of the aromatic rings might slightly adjust this value. Without a clear, direct correlation, the prediction leans towards the value associated with halogenated aromatic compounds.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-674.49075948}$

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCOC=O, we need to analyze the given examples and look for patterns or similarities.

Upon examining the provided molecules and their corresponding property values, it appears that the property is related to the molecular structure, possibly the heat of formation or a similar thermodynamic property. However, without explicit information about the property, we'll proceed based on patterns and known chemical principles.

The molecule CCCCOC=O can be identified as butyl acetate or a similar ester, depending on the specific isomer. Esters typically have a carbonyl group (C=O) linked to an ether group (C-O-C). 

Looking at the examples provided:
- CCCC(=O)OCC has a value of 0.0, which is an ester.
- CCc1cccc(C)c1N(C(C)COC)C(=O)CCl has a value of 83.0931582, which includes an ester group among other functional groups.
- CC(=O)OC1=CC(=O)CC(C)(C)C1 has a value of 520.87100095, which also includes ester functionalities.

Given these examples, it seems that esters tend to have positive or near-zero values for this property, especially when compared to halogenated compounds or those with multiple aromatic rings, which often have negative values.

However, without a clear pattern or a specific formula to apply, we must consider the general chemical properties of esters. Esters are known for their relatively stable nature and are often used in a variety of applications, including perfumes, flavors, and as solvents, due to their generally favorable physical and chemical properties.

Given the information and the tendency of esters to have more positive or neutral values compared to many of the other compounds listed, and considering the simplicity of the butyl acetate molecule (CCCCOC=O) compared to the more complex molecules with higher values, a reasonable prediction might lean towards a value that reflects stability and simplicity, potentially closer to zero or slightly positive, but without a clear pattern, this is speculative.

Therefore, based on the provided examples and the nature of esters, a predicted property value for CCCCOC=O could be around 0.0, considering the simplicity of the molecule and the tendency of esters to have values that are not as negative as those of halogenated or complex aromatic compounds. However, this prediction is highly speculative without a clear understanding of the property being measured.

Given this similarity, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for ClCCl will be the same as ClCCCl, which is -674.49075948.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule ClCCl is -674.49075948.

## Step 4: Predicting the property value for the target molecule
Based on the similarity between the target molecule and the given molecules, we can predict that the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O will be close to the values of the molecules with similar structures.

The given molecules are represented in SMILES notation, and their corresponding properties are provided. To predict the property for the new molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, we need to identify any patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identify patterns in the molecular structures
Upon examining the molecules, it appears that many of them contain halogen atoms (Cl, Br), aromatic rings, and various functional groups. The properties seem to be related to the molecular structure, but there is no obvious direct correlation.

## Step 3: Look for similar molecules in the given examples
The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl seems to be similar to other molecules containing multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings, such as Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl and c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24.

## Step 4: Compare the properties of similar molecules
The properties of the similar molecules are -674.49075948 and -674.49075948, respectively. This suggests that the property might be related to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings.

## Step 5: Make a prediction based on the patterns and similarities
Based on the patterns and similarities observed, it is likely that the property of the molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl will be similar to that of the similar molecules.

The final answer is: $\boxed{-674.49075948}$

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule CC=C(C)C, let's analyze the given examples and look for patterns or similar structures that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Similar Structures**: Looking at the provided examples, there are several molecules that contain simple hydrocarbon chains or rings, which might help in predicting the property for CC=C(C)C. For instance, molecules like CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1, CCCCCCCCC=C, and CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C all have property values of -674.49075948. This suggests that simple hydrocarbons or those with minimal functional groups might have a specific, possibly constant, property value.

2. **Functional Groups and Property Values**: The presence of certain functional groups seems to significantly affect the property values. For example, molecules with complex rings, multiple bonds, or specific functional groups like carbonyl (C=O), hydroxyl (OH), or amine (NH2) groups tend to have more positive or varied property values. In contrast, simple alkanes or alkenes (like the given CC=C(C)C) tend to have more negative or a specific constant property value.

3. **Given Molecule Analysis**: The molecule CC=C(C)C is an alkene, specifically isoprene, which is a simple hydrocarbon with one double bond. Given the pattern observed with other simple hydrocarbons, it's reasonable to predict that its property value might align with those of similar simple structures.

Based on the observation that many simple hydrocarbons have a property value of -674.49075948, and considering the molecule CC=C(C)C is also a relatively simple hydrocarbon, the predicted property value for CC=C(C)C would be -674.49075948. This prediction is made under the assumption that the property in question does not significantly differentiate between alkanes and alkenes or is not heavily influenced by the presence of a double bond in this context.

Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule ClCCl, let's analyze the given examples and look for patterns or similar structures that could help in estimating the property value.

1. **Similar Structures**: Looking at the provided examples, there are molecules with chlorine (Cl) atoms and carbon chains. For instance, "Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1" has a value of -155.67144145, and "ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl" has a value of -674.49075948. These molecules have chlorine atoms attached to a carbon ring or chain.

2. **Chlorine Impact**: The presence of chlorine atoms seems to significantly affect the property value. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have more negative values (e.g., "ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl" with a value of -674.49075948).

3. **Carbon Chain Length**: The length of the carbon chain also seems to influence the property value. Shorter chains tend to have less negative values (e.g., "CC(C)(C)c1ccc(O)cc1" with a value of -155.67144145).

Given the molecule ClCCl, it has a short carbon chain with two chlorine atoms attached. Comparing it with the examples:

- It's similar to "ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl" but without the double bond and with fewer chlorine atoms.
- It's much simpler than most of the other molecules listed, with a very short carbon chain and only two chlorine atoms.

Considering these points, the molecule ClCCl would likely have a property value that reflects its simplicity and the presence of chlorine atoms. Given the trend that molecules with chlorine atoms and short carbon chains tend to have negative values, and considering the simplicity of ClCCl compared to other molecules, a reasonable prediction might be closer to the less negative end of the spectrum for molecules with chlorine, but still negative due to the presence of chlorine.

**Prediction**: Based on the patterns observed and without a clear, direct comparison, a predicted property value for ClCCl could be around -155.67144145, considering its structural simplicity and the influence of chlorine atoms. However, this is a very rough estimate and should be taken as a speculative prediction based on limited analysis. The actual value could vary significantly based on the specific property being measured, which is not specified in the question.

This molecule is very similar to the one we are trying to predict for, with the only difference being the position of one chlorine atom.

2. **Chlorination Effect**: Chlorine atoms tend to have a specific effect on the molecular properties due to their electronegativity and size. In many cases, the addition of chlorine atoms to a benzene ring (as in the case of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl) can lead to predictable changes in the property values based on the number and position of the chlorine atoms.

3. **Property Value Patterns**: Observing the property values for molecules with benzene rings and chlorine substitutions, there seems to be a pattern where the property value can be somewhat predicted based on the type of substitution and the overall structure of the molecule. For example, molecules with similar substitution patterns on a benzene ring tend to have property values that are closer in value.

Given these observations and the similarity between Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl and Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, it's reasonable to predict that the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl would be close to that of Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which is -155.67144145.

**Prediction**: Based on the similarity in structure and the patterns observed in the property values of similar molecules, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is -155.67144145. This prediction assumes that the effect of the chlorine atoms and the overall molecular structure on the property in question follows a consistent pattern as observed in the provided examples.

The given list of molecules and their corresponding property values shows a wide range of chemical structures and property values. To predict the property for the given molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, we need to look for patterns or correlations between the molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns or correlations
Upon examining the given molecules, it's challenging to identify a straightforward pattern or correlation between the molecular structures and their properties based solely on the provided information. The property values seem to vary widely without an immediately apparent relationship to specific functional groups, molecular size, or other structural features.

## Step 3: Considering the complexity of the prediction
Given the complexity and diversity of the molecules and their properties, predicting the property for a new molecule requires a deep understanding of the underlying chemistry and potentially the use of advanced computational methods or machine learning algorithms trained on a large dataset of molecular structures and their properties.

## Step 4: Recognizing the limitations of manual prediction
Without access to external tools, databases, or computational models, accurately predicting the property for the given molecule is highly speculative. The property values provided for the example molecules do not follow a simple or obvious trend that could be applied to predict the property of a new, unseen molecule.

## Step 5: Conclusion based on available information
Given the information provided and the limitations of manual analysis without computational tools, it's not feasible to accurately predict the specific property value for the molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based solely on the examples given.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 1218.1867328949913
Predicted Property:
## Step 1: Analyzing the given molecules and their properties
The given list of molecules and their corresponding property values shows a wide range of chemical structures, from simple hydrocarbons to more complex molecules with various functional groups. The property values range from negative to positive, indicating that the property might be related to the molecular structure, possibly related to energy or stability.

## Step 2: Identifying patterns or correlations
Upon closer inspection, it appears that molecules with similar structures or functional groups tend to have similar property values. For example, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms (e.g., Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl, Clc1ccc(cc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl) have a property value of -674.49075948, suggesting that the presence of chlorine atoms might be a significant factor in determining the property value.

## Step 3: Examining the molecule to be predicted
The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C has a unique structure, with a thiophene ring and a substituted amide group. There are no obvious similarities with the molecules in the given list, making it challenging to predict the property value based on patterns or correlations.

## Step 4: Considering the potential property
Given the diversity of molecules and property values, it is likely that the property is related to a fundamental aspect of molecular structure, such as molecular energy, stability, or reactivity. However, without more information or a clear pattern, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact property.

## Step 5: Making an educated prediction
Based on the presence of the thiophene ring and the substituted amide group, which are both relatively stable functional groups, it is possible that the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C might be closer to the positive end of the spectrum. However, without a clear pattern or correlation, this prediction is highly speculative.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1166.12527884}$

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule CCCCCCBr, we need to analyze the given examples and look for patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their corresponding property values.

Upon examining the examples, it appears that the property value is related to the type and number of functional groups present in the molecule. However, without a clear understanding of the property being predicted, it's challenging to provide an accurate prediction.

That being said, let's look at some examples that might be relevant:

* CCCCC(=O)CCC has a property value of -236.71291673, which suggests that the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) might contribute to a negative property value.
* CCCCCC(=O)C has a property value of -236.71291673, which is similar to the previous example.
* Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of -674.49075948, which suggests that the presence of a bromine atom (Br) might contribute to a negative property value.

Given the molecule CCCCCCBr, it contains a bromine atom (Br) but no carbonyl group (C=O). Based on the examples provided, it's possible that the presence of the bromine atom might dominate the property value.

Therefore, I predict that the property value for the molecule CCCCCCBr will be similar to that of other molecules containing a bromine atom, such as Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which has a property value of -674.49075948.

Predicted property value: -674.49075948

SMILES: CO
True Property: -155.6714414457389
Predicted Property:
To predict the property for the molecule CO, we need to analyze the given examples and look for patterns or relationships between the molecular structures and their corresponding property values.

Upon examining the examples, we notice that the property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups or the overall complexity of the molecule.

One pattern that stands out is that molecules with simple, saturated hydrocarbon chains (e.g., CC, CCC, CCCC) tend to have negative property values around -674.49. Molecules with slightly more complex structures, such as those containing oxygen or nitrogen atoms (e.g., COC, CCN, CNN), tend to have property values that are more positive, but still relatively low (e.g., around 0.0 to 500.0).

The molecule CO is a simple, diatomic molecule consisting of a carbon atom bonded to an oxygen atom. Based on the patterns observed in the examples, we might expect the property value for CO to be relatively low, possibly negative, given its simple structure.

However, it's also worth noting that CO is a highly reactive molecule with a strong bond between the carbon and oxygen atoms. This reactivity might contribute to a more positive property value compared to the simple hydrocarbons.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO might be a value that is slightly negative, but not as negative as the simple hydrocarbons. A possible predicted property value for CO could be around -300.0 to -400.0.

Keep in mind that this prediction is based on limited data and may not be entirely accurate. The actual property value for CO could be significantly different, depending on the specific property being predicted and the underlying relationships between molecular structure and property values.
