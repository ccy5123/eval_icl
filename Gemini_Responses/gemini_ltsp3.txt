True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
The provided examples suggest a correlation between the molecular structure and the given property. Analyzing the examples, it appears that:

*   **Aromatic systems, especially those with heteroatoms or multiple substituents, tend to have negative property values.** For instance, `Oc1ccccc1Cl` (-674.49), `c2ccc1scnc1c2` (-674.49), `c1ccncc1` (-674.49), `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (-674.49), `Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1` (-674.49), `c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1` (-674.49), `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (-674.49), `Fc1cccc(F)c1` (-674.49), `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (-674.49), `NC(=S)N` (-674.49), `c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3` (-674.49). Many of these are around -674.49.
*   **Simple aliphatic hydrocarbons and alcohols tend to have large positive values.** For example, `C1CCCCC1` (1214.08), `OCC(O)CO` (1214.08), `OC1CCCCC1` (1214.08), `CCCCCCBr` (1214.08), `CCCCCO` (1214.08), `FC(F)(Cl)C(F)(Cl)Cl` (1214.08).
*   **Molecules with carbonyl groups, especially esters and amides, show a range of positive values, often in the hundreds.** For example, `CCCOC(=O)CCC` (944.28), `CC(C)C(=O)C(C)C` (944.28), `CCCOC(=O)C` (836.36), `CC(=O)OCC(COC(=O)C)OC(=O)C` (584.55), `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C` (584.55), `CCC#CCC` (584.55), `CCCC(=O)OC` (836.36), `CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O` (584.55).
*   **Molecules with multiple aromatic rings or complex fused systems, especially with nitrogen or oxygen, can have negative values, but sometimes less negative than the -674.49 group.** For example, `Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12` (-359.72), `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` (-502.80), `COc2c1occc1cc3ccc(=O)oc23` (-517.10).
*   **Amides involving aromatic rings often fall into a less negative or slightly positive range.** For example, `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (-438.41), `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` (-107.91), `CN(C)C=Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1C` (-107.91).

The target molecule is `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2`. This molecule is a urea derivative with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. It contains two aromatic rings and a central carbonyl group.

Considering the examples:
*   `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` has a value of -438.41. This is an amide with one aromatic ring.
*   `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` has a value of -107.91. This is a carbamate with one aromatic ring.
*   `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` has a value of 741.93. This is a cyclic urea, but aliphatic.

The target molecule has two aromatic rings directly attached to the urea nitrogens. This suggests a more significant aromatic character than a simple amide with one ring. The presence of two phenyl groups will likely push the value towards the negative side, similar to other multi-ring aromatic systems or highly substituted aromatic compounds.

Given the values for amides and carbamates with one aromatic ring (-438.41, -107.91), and the very negative values for highly halogenated or simple heteroaromatic systems (-674.49), the presence of two phenyl rings in a urea structure would likely result in a negative value. It's more complex than a single benzene ring, but less "heteroatom-dense" or halogenated than the -674.49 group.

Comparing it to `Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12` (-359.72) or `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` (-502.80), which are just hydrocarbons with two rings, the presence of the urea linkage might make it slightly less negative or similar. However, the direct attachment of the phenyl groups to the nitrogen atoms of the urea, which are part of the pi system, suggests a significant aromatic influence.

Let's consider the structure `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2`. This is N,N'-diphenylurea. It has two benzene rings.
The value for `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` is -438.41899366. This is an acetamide with one bromophenyl group.
The value for `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` is -107.91852152. This is a carbamate with one substituted phenyl group.

The target molecule has two unsubstituted phenyl groups. The presence of two aromatic rings will contribute significantly to the negative value. It's likely to be more negative than a single aromatic ring amide but perhaps not as negative as the highly halogenated or simple heteroaromatic compounds that consistently show -674.49.

A value around -400 to -500 seems plausible, given the examples. The closest structural analogy with a negative value is `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (-438.41). The target molecule has two phenyl groups, which might make it slightly more negative than a single bromophenyl group.

Let's consider the general trend:
- Alkanes/alcohols: ~1200
- Esters/ketones (aliphatic): ~800-900
- Complex steroids/large molecules: ~700-1100
- Simple aromatics/heteroaromatics/halogenated aromatics: ~-674
- Amides/carbamates with one aromatic ring: ~-100 to -400
- Fused aromatic systems: ~-300 to -500

The target molecule is a diaryl urea. It has two aromatic rings. This is more "aromatic" than the single-ring amides/carbamates. It's not a simple fused system like naphthalene or anthracene, but it has two distinct aromatic moieties.

Given the examples, the value -438.41899366 for `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` is a good reference point. The target molecule has two phenyl groups, which might make it slightly more negative than a single bromophenyl group. However, the urea linkage itself might have a different contribution than a simple amide.

Let's consider the "aromaticity" contribution. Two phenyl rings are present.
If we consider the -674.49 group as a baseline for "highly aromatic/substituted aromatic", and -438.41 for a single aromatic amide.
The target molecule has two phenyl rings, which is more than one, but less "dense" in terms of heteroatoms or halogens than the -674.49 group.

A value in the range of -400 to -500 seems most consistent with the provided data. Given the examples, a value close to -438.41 or slightly more negative due to the second phenyl group.

Let's try to find a pattern for the negative values.
-674.49: Highly substituted aromatics, simple heteroaromatics, nitroaromatics, polyhalogenated aromatics. These seem to be a "floor" for highly aromatic/electron-deficient systems.
-438.41: Amide with one bromophenyl.
-107.91: Carbamate with one substituted phenyl.
-359.72: Methylbiphenyl.
-502.80: Methylnaphthalene.

The target molecule `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` is N,N'-diphenylurea. It has two phenyl rings.
It's structurally somewhat similar to a biphenyl derivative, but with a urea linker.
Methylbiphenyl `Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12` has -359.72.
Methylnaphthalene `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` has -502.80.

The urea group itself is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding. However, the dominant feature here seems to be the two aromatic rings.
If we consider the range between -359.72 (methylbiphenyl) and -502.80 (methylnaphthalene), the target molecule falls within this complexity. It has two separate phenyl rings, similar to biphenyl, but linked by a urea.

Given the examples, the value -438.41899366 for `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` is a strong candidate for comparison. The target molecule has two unsubstituted phenyl rings, while the example has one bromophenyl. The presence of a second phenyl ring might make it slightly more negative.

Let's consider the possibility of it being close to -438.41. The bromine in the example is electron-withdrawing, which might contribute to the negative value. Two unsubstituted phenyl rings might have a similar or slightly more negative effect.

Final prediction based on the closest structural analogies and the general trend of aromatic compounds having negative values.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -438.4189936597869
Predicted Property:
The provided examples show a wide range of property values, and the values seem to cluster around certain numbers. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2**

This molecule contains:
*   A five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups (O=C) and two nitrogen atoms (a cyclic urea derivative).
*   An imine linkage (N=C).
*   A furan ring (o1).
*   A nitro group (N(=O)=O).

Looking at the examples, molecules with multiple rings, heteroatoms, and functional groups (like nitro, halogens, carbonyls, etc.) tend to have more negative or less positive values, often deviating from the large positive values seen for simple alkanes or alcohols.

Let's consider some examples with similar complexity or functional groups:

*   `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2`: -674.49075948 (Two aromatic rings, ether, nitro, halogens)
*   `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2`: -674.49075948 (Two fused rings, lactone, N, Cl)
*   `OCC1OC(C(O)C1O)n2cnc3c(O)ncnc23`: 269.79630379 (Sugar derivative, fused purine-like system, multiple OH)
*   `OC(Cn1cncn1)(c2ccc(F)cc2)c3ccccc3F`: -438.41899366 (Triazole, two phenyl rings, F, OH)
*   `CC(OC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1)C#C`: -331.11364556 (Amide, ester, phenyl, Cl, alkyne)
*   `COc2ccc(Oc1ccc(NC(=O)N(C)C)cc1)cc2`: -320.38311075 (Two aromatic rings, ether, urea, methoxy)
*   `CCN2c1nc(C)cc(C(F)(F)F)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23`: -170.8709924 (Multiple fused rings, amide, CF3, N)
*   `CC12CC2(C)C(=O)N(C1=O)c3cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c3`: 51.88390458 (Fused rings, cyclic imide, Cl)

The target molecule has a cyclic urea, an imine, a furan ring, and a nitro group. This combination suggests a value that is likely negative or slightly positive, similar to the range of values observed for complex, heterocyclic, and aromatic compounds.

The presence of the nitro group and multiple rings often correlates with more negative values. The cyclic urea and imine add to the complexity.

Comparing it to `CC12CC2(C)C(=O)N(C1=O)c3cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c3` (51.88390458), which has a cyclic imide and two chlorines, our molecule has a nitro group which is a strong electron-withdrawing group, and a furan ring.

Considering the complexity and the presence of a nitro group and multiple heteroatoms, a value in the range of -100 to 100 seems plausible. The cyclic urea and imine might push it towards a less negative or even slightly positive value compared to highly halogenated or polycyclic aromatic systems.

Let's look at `OCC1OC(C(O)C1O)n2cnc3c(O)ncnc23` (269.79630379), which is a nucleoside. It has many oxygens and nitrogens.
And `CC12CC2(C)C(=O)N(C1=O)c3cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c3` (51.88390458) has a cyclic imide.

The molecule `O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2` has a cyclic urea, an imine, a furan, and a nitro group. This is a highly functionalized and somewhat rigid structure.

Given the examples, values like -44.96605063, 51.88390458, 103.15741027, 269.79630379 are seen for molecules with significant heteroatom content and ring systems. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which often correlates with more negative values in some contexts, but here it's part of a larger, complex structure.

Considering the cyclic urea (similar to cyclic imides in complexity) and the furan ring, and the nitro group, a value in the positive range, but not as high as simple alkanes, seems reasonable. It's more complex than a simple aromatic with one substituent, but less "aromatic" in the sense of large fused systems that often get very negative values.

The value of 51.88390458 for `CC12CC2(C)C(=O)N(C1=O)c3cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c3` seems like a good reference point due to the cyclic imide and aromatic ring with halogens. Our molecule has a cyclic urea, an imine, a furan, and a nitro group. The furan and nitro group add to the complexity and polarity.

I will predict a value close to the 51.88 value, perhaps slightly higher due to the furan and nitro group's contribution to polarity and complexity, but not as high as the sugar derivative.

True Property: 269.7963037906381
Predicted Property:
The provided examples show a wide range of property values, and it appears that the property might be related to the molecular structure, specifically the presence of certain functional groups, rings, and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

Let's analyze the given molecule: **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2**

This molecule contains:
*   A spiro system with a cyclopropane ring (C1CC1) fused to a five-membered ring.
*   Two amide groups (-NC(=O)-).
*   Three carbonyl groups (C=O).
*   It's a relatively small and rigid bicyclic system.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar features (small, rigid, cyclic, containing carbonyls and/or nitrogen) often have negative or relatively low positive values.

*   `CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3ccccc23` (a complex bicyclic system with amides and aromatic rings) has -320.38311075.
*   `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` (a bicyclic system with amide, imine, and aromatic rings) has -548.58581771.
*   `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (an amide with an aromatic ring) has -254.80762025.
*   `ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (a complex bicyclic system with amide, carbonyls, and aromatic rings) has -383.94089386.

The target molecule is smaller and lacks aromaticity compared to many of the negative examples, but it has a high density of polar groups (carbonyls, amides) and a strained ring system (cyclopropane). The presence of multiple carbonyls and amide nitrogens suggests a significant contribution to the property.

Considering the examples, the values around -300 to -600 seem plausible for molecules with significant cyclic and polar character, but without the large, extended aromatic systems that lead to values like -674.49. The cyclopropane ring and the two amide linkages make it somewhat unique among the examples.

Given the structural features, particularly the two amide linkages and the strained cyclopropane ring within a bicyclic system, it's likely to fall into a similar range as other complex, polar, and cyclic molecules. It's not a simple alkane or a highly extended aromatic system.

Let's estimate based on the complexity and functional groups. It's more complex than a simple amide but less extended than a multi-ring aromatic system.

A value in the range of -300 to -500 seems reasonable.

True Property: 1214.0833670578713
Predicted Property:
The provided examples suggest a pattern where highly chlorinated, relatively small molecules, especially those with multiple chlorine atoms on a single carbon or in a compact structure, tend to have a property value around -674.49075948.

Let's analyze the given molecule: ClCCl (Dichloromethane).
It is a small molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a single carbon atom. This structure is analogous to several examples that exhibit the -674.49075948 value, such as:
- Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1
- Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl
- ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl
- Oc1cccc(Cl)c1
- Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34 (This one is a large polycyclic aromatic amine, but the value is the same, suggesting a common underlying characteristic for certain types of molecules, perhaps related to their electronic structure or specific interactions, which might be shared by highly chlorinated compounds).

Given the strong correlation between highly chlorinated, compact structures and the value -674.49075948 in the examples, it is highly probable that ClCCl will share this property value.

True Property: 367.4811724044898
Predicted Property:
The provided examples show a wide range of property values, and the relationship between the molecular structure and the property is not immediately obvious from a simple visual inspection. However, I can attempt to identify patterns based on the provided data.

Let's analyze the given examples:

*   **1214.08336706:** Appears for simple alkanes, alcohols, and some sugars/polysaccharides. These are generally less complex molecules or highly saturated structures.
*   **-44.96605063:** Appears for cyclic amides (like urea derivatives) and some substituted benzenes with methyl and hydroxyl groups.
*   **-674.49075948:** Appears for highly halogenated compounds, aromatic compounds with multiple rings or strong electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro, cyano), and simple alkynes. This suggests a negative value for highly conjugated or electron-deficient systems, or those with heavy halogens.
*   **269.79630379:** Appears for a long chain unsaturated ketone.
*   **183.95202531:** Appears for a complex purine derivative with a sugar.
*   **-107.91852152:** Appears for substituted anilides/amides.
*   **342.4337702:** Appears for a complex fused ring system with a sulfonate ester and a nitro-substituted aniline.
*   **854.354962:** Appears for complex steroid-like structures with multiple rings and ketones/alcohols.
*   **632.98363582:** Appears for a cyclic imide with a large alkyl substituent.
*   **-73.58081012:** Appears for a complex imide with two phenyl groups.
*   **-202.34722784:** Appears for a complex imide with two phenyl groups and a shorter alkyl chain, and also for an organophosphate.
*   **-238.66596105:** Appears for a sulfonamide with a heterocyclic ring.
*   **80.93889114:** Appears for a simple alkyl-substituted benzene.
*   **836.36854175:** Appears for a complex organophosphate.
*   **794.40022783:** Appears for a complex di-carbamate.
*   **930.79724808:** Appears for a complex steroid-like structure.
*   **-276.89620652:** Appears for a complex fused ring system with a lactone and a phenol.
*   **584.55865821:** Appears for a complex steroid-like structure with a phenol.

The target molecule is: **COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67**

This molecule is highly complex, featuring:
*   Multiple fused rings.
*   Several oxygen atoms, including ethers (methoxy, cyclic ethers), hydroxyls, and a lactone (COC=O).
*   A spiro center (C6).
*   A sugar-like moiety (the OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O part).
*   A catechol-like structure with methoxy groups (COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)).
*   A methylenedioxybenzene group (OCOc5).

Given its complexity and the presence of multiple fused rings, oxygen functionalities (ethers, alcohols, lactone), and a sugar-like component, it shares characteristics with some of the larger, more complex molecules in the examples.

Let's compare it to the examples with high positive values:
*   **1214.08336706:** Simple alkanes, alcohols, sugars. While it has sugar-like parts, the overall structure is much more rigid and complex than simple sugars.
*   **854.354962** and **930.79724808:** Steroid-like structures. The target molecule has a similar level of complexity and multiple fused rings, but its ring system is different from typical steroids.
*   **836.36854175** and **794.40022783:** Complex organophosphates and carbamates. The target molecule doesn't have phosphorus or nitrogen in the same way.
*   **632.98363582:** A cyclic imide with a large alkyl substituent. The target molecule is more oxygen-rich and has more fused rings.
*   **584.55865821:** A steroid-like structure with a phenol. This is somewhat similar in complexity.

The presence of many oxygen atoms, particularly in cyclic ether forms and a lactone, suggests a molecule that might be relatively polar and have a significant molecular weight. The fused ring system and the sugar-like part contribute to its overall size and complexity.

Considering the values for complex, multi-ring, oxygen-rich structures:
*   Steroids (854.35, 930.79, 584.55)
*   Complex sugars (1214.08)

The target molecule is a highly condensed polycyclic ether with a lactone and a sugar-like moiety. It's not a simple alkane or a simple sugar. It's more akin to a natural product with a complex scaffold.

The values around 800-900 seem to correspond to large, multi-ring structures with various functional groups. The target molecule fits this description well. It's a very large and intricate molecule.

Based on the complexity, the number of rings, and the presence of various oxygen functionalities (ethers, alcohols, lactone), the molecule most closely resembles the complexity of the steroid-like molecules or the larger sugar derivatives.

I will lean towards a value in the higher positive range, similar to the complex steroid-like molecules. The presence of the sugar-like part and the overall density of oxygen atoms might push it slightly higher than some of the steroid examples.

Predicted property value: 880.00

The final answer is $\boxed{880.00}$
