SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.7056211022216693
Predicted Property:
The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is a chlorinated benzofuranone derivative.

Let's analyze the provided examples to find similar structural motifs and their associated property values.

Let's look at the examples with similar features:
*   **Halogenation:** Many examples show that chlorine atoms can significantly influence the property.

The target molecule `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2` is a chlorinated 4H-furo[3,2-c]quinolin-4-one or a similar structure. It has a lactone and an imide group.

Let's compare it to `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12`, which has a chlorinated benzoxazole-2-one part (`c1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12`). The property is -0.22071248.
The target molecule has a similar fused ring system with a chlorine atom on the benzene ring and a carbonyl group in the heterocyclic ring. The difference is the presence of an -NH- group instead of an oxygen in the five-membered ring, making it an imide rather than a lactone in that specific position.

Consider the effect of the imide group.
`O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC` (-0.49001465) and `O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1` (-0.49001465) are barbituric acid derivatives or similar cyclic imides. Their values are negative.

The presence of the chlorine atom tends to increase the value (e.g., `ClCC` is 1.55767011, `BrC(Cl)Cl` is 5.60346169).
However, in aromatic systems, the effect can be more nuanced. For example, `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` is -0.4084828, which is negative.

The molecule `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2` has a fused aromatic ring with a lactone and an imide.
The closest structural analogue in the examples is `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12` which has a chlorinated benzoxazole-2-one part and a value of -0.22071248.
The target molecule has a similar core, but with an additional nitrogen in the ring.

Let's consider the impact of the nitrogen.
`c1cncnc1` (pyridine) is -0.85386083.
`CNc1ccccc1` (aniline) is -0.84793124.
`Cc1ccccc1N` (toluidine) is -0.84793124.
These are all negative.

The target molecule has a lactone and an imide.
The value for `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12` is -0.22071248. This molecule has a chlorinated benzoxazole-2-one.
The target molecule is a chlorinated benzofuranone fused with an imide.

Given the presence of the chlorine atom and the fused heterocyclic system with carbonyls, the value is likely to be in a similar range to the chlorinated benzoxazole-2-one. The imide group might slightly shift it.

Let's consider the structure `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2`. This is a chlorinated isatin derivative, specifically 5-chloroisatin.
Isatin itself is a bicyclic compound with a lactam and a ketone. The given structure has a lactone and an imide.

Let's re-examine `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12`. The `c1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12` part is a chlorinated benzoxazolone. Its value is -0.22071248.
The target molecule `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2` is a chlorinated indolone derivative, specifically 5-chloro-2-oxindole. No, it's not. It's a chlorinated furo[3,2-c]quinolinone derivative. It's a fused system with a benzene ring, a furanone ring, and a pyrrolone ring.

Let's consider the functional groups:
- Aromatic ring (chlorinated)
- Lactone (cyclic ester, -oc(=O)-)
- Imide (cyclic amide, -[nH]c(=O)-)

The value for `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12` is -0.22071248. This molecule has a chlorinated benzoxazolone core.
The target molecule has a similar chlorinated aromatic ring fused to a five-membered ring with a carbonyl and an oxygen, and another five-membered ring with a carbonyl and a nitrogen.

The presence of the chlorine atom on the aromatic ring, combined with the fused heterocyclic system containing carbonyls, suggests a value that is not extremely high or low.
The values for chlorinated aromatic compounds are varied:
- `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` is -0.4084828.
- `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` is -0.4084828.
- `Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` is 2.3285167.

The value of -0.22071248 for `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12` seems to be the most relevant comparison due to the chlorinated benzoxazolone moiety. The target molecule has a similar fused ring system with a chlorine and carbonyls. The additional nitrogen in the ring might slightly alter the value.

Given the examples, the values for complex fused systems with halogens and carbonyls can be positive or negative.
The value of -0.22071248 for the chlorinated benzoxazolone derivative is a good starting point. The target molecule has a similar core structure.

Final prediction based on the closest structural analogy:

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 3.1033163368250327
Predicted Property:
The provided examples suggest that the property value is related to the molecular structure, specifically the presence and arrangement of certain atoms and functional groups. Let's analyze the given molecule:

**Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**

This molecule contains:
*   Two fluorine atoms on one phenyl ring.
*   A urea-like linkage (-C(=O)NC(=O)N-).
*   A chlorine atom on another phenyl ring.

Let's look for similar patterns in the examples:

*   **Halogens (F, Cl, Br):**
    *   `BrC(Br)(Br)Br`: 12.43105411 (High value, many Br)
    *   `ClC1=C(Cl)C(Cl)(C(=C1Cl)Cl)C2(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C(=C2Cl)Cl)Cl`: 11.87564927 (Very high value, many Cl)
    *   `Brc1ccc(Br)cc1`: 1.13913995 (Two Br, moderate value)
    *   `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1`: -0.0 (Two Cl, low value)
    *   `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`: -0.0 (Two Cl, low value)
    *   `ClCCCl`: 2.85213235 (Three Cl, moderate value)
    *   `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`: 0.22680678 (Three Cl, moderate value)
    *   `Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl`: 0.22680678 (Three Cl, moderate value)
    *   `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`: 2.3285167 (Many Cl, high value)
    *   `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1`: -0.84579 (Three F, low value)
    *   `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl`: -0.4084828 (Two Cl, low value)

    It seems that the number and proximity of halogens, especially heavier ones like Br and Cl, tend to increase the property value. Fluorine, however, seems to lead to lower values.

*   **Amide/Urea-like linkages:**
    *   `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)`: 0.28083193 (Contains -NC(=O)-)
    *   `CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O`: -0.49001465 (Contains -C(=O)NC(=O)N-, similar to urea)
    *   `NC(=O)c1cccnc1`: -0.50533276 (Contains -C(=O)N-)
    *   `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`: -0.44208381 (Contains -C(=O)NN-)
    *   `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1`: -0.80625941 (Contains -NC(=S)N-)

    These groups generally lead to negative or slightly positive values. The `CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O` example is particularly relevant due to the `C(=O)NC(=O)N` moiety, yielding -0.49001465.

*   **Aromatic rings:** Most molecules with aromatic rings have negative or low positive values unless heavily substituted with halogens.

**Combining the observations for Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2:**

1.  **Fluorine atoms:** Two fluorines on one ring. Based on `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` (-0.84579), fluorine tends to decrease the value.
2.  **Chlorine atom:** One chlorine on the other ring. Examples like `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (-0.0) and `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (-0.4084828) suggest that a few chlorines can lead to low or negative values.
3.  **Urea linkage:** The `C(=O)NC(=O)N` group is present. The example `CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O` gives -0.49001465.

The presence of the urea linkage strongly suggests a value in the negative range, similar to -0.49. The fluorines would likely push it further down, while the single chlorine might slightly counteract that, but not enough to make it highly positive.

Considering the dominant influence of the urea-like structure and the fluorine atoms, the value is likely to be negative and close to the -0.49 value seen for the similar urea derivative. The additional halogens (F and Cl) are not as numerous or as clustered as in the high-value examples (e.g., `BrC(Br)(Br)Br` or `ClC1=C(Cl)C(Cl)...`).

Therefore, a value slightly more negative than -0.49001465 seems plausible due to the two fluorines, but still in that general range.

Let's estimate based on the closest structural analogue:
`CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O` has a value of -0.49001465.
Our molecule has a similar core, but with two phenyl rings and halogens.
The `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` example gives -0.84579.
The `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1` example gives -0.0.

The combination of the urea group and the halogens suggests a value that is negative. The two fluorines and one chlorine are not as numerous as in the highly positive examples. The urea group itself tends to give negative values.

Given the strong influence of the `C(=O)NC(=O)N` group, the value should be in a similar range to -0.49001465. The presence of halogens, especially fluorine, tends to make values more negative or keep them low.

I predict a value slightly more negative than -0.49001465, considering the fluorine atoms.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.1792053592943934
Predicted Property:
The molecule is biphenyl, c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2.

Looking at the provided examples, we can observe a trend where the property value seems to be related to the size, complexity, and presence of certain functional groups or heteroatoms in the molecule.

Let's analyze some relevant examples:

*   **Simple hydrocarbons:**
    *   CCCCCCC (heptane): 0.54025145
    *   CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C (2,2,4-trimethylpentane): 0.54025145
    *   CCC(C)(C)C (2,2-dimethylpropane): 0.54025145
    *   C/C1CCCCC1\C (1,2-dimethylcyclohexane): 0.54025145
    *   C1CCc2ccccc2C1 (tetralin): -0.82157751 (This is a fused ring system, more rigid)
    *   CC(C)c1ccccc1C (1-isopropyl-2-methylbenzene): -0.82157751 (Substituted benzene, but still relatively small)

*   **Aromatic systems:**
    *   Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (methylchrysene derivative): 0.48029672 (Larger polycyclic aromatic)
    *   c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 (coronene): 7.11814229 (Very large, highly conjugated polycyclic aromatic)
    *   Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34 (amino-substituted benzanthracene derivative): 3.46880962 (Large, fused aromatic with an amino group)
    *   Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C (9,10-dimethylanthracene): -0.61601842 (Fused aromatic, but smaller than coronene)

Biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) consists of two benzene rings directly linked. It is a relatively simple aromatic system compared to the larger fused polycyclic aromatics like coronene or benzanthracene derivatives, but larger than a single benzene ring or simple substituted benzenes.

Comparing it to:
*   C1CCc2ccccc2C1 (tetralin, a fused benzene and cyclohexane): -0.82157751
*   CC(C)c1ccccc1C (1-isopropyl-2-methylbenzene): -0.82157751

Biphenyl has more aromatic character and a larger conjugated system than these examples. It's also more flexible than fused systems.

Given the values for larger polycyclic aromatics (e.g., 7.118 for coronene, 3.468 for the benzanthracene derivative) and smaller substituted benzenes (around -0.8), biphenyl should fall somewhere in between, likely on the positive side, but not as high as the very large fused systems.

The property seems to increase with the extent of conjugation and the number of aromatic rings, especially in non-fused or less rigid systems. Biphenyl has two aromatic rings directly connected, allowing for some conjugation across the bond.

Considering the general trend, a value slightly positive or close to zero, but definitely higher than simple substituted benzenes and lower than large fused polycycles, seems appropriate.

Let's consider the "size" and "aromaticity" aspect. Biphenyl is essentially two benzene rings.
If a single benzene ring (not explicitly given, but implied by substituted benzenes) might have a negative value, adding another ring and maintaining aromaticity should increase the value.

The value for "Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1" (a methyl-substituted chrysene, 4 rings) is 0.48029672. Biphenyl has 2 rings. This suggests a positive value, but smaller than chrysene.

A value around 0.5 to 1.0 seems plausible for biphenyl, given its structure. It's more complex than a simple alkane (0.54) but less so than large polycyclic aromatics (3.4 to 7.1).

Let's re-evaluate the examples:
*   CCCCCCC (heptane): 0.54025145
*   CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC (diethyl phthalate): 0.54025145 (This is interesting, a benzene ring with two ester groups, similar value to heptane)
*   CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C (2,2,4-trimethylpentane): 0.54025145

These examples suggest that for some molecules, the property can be around 0.5 even with different functionalities. Biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic system.

Given the examples, especially the comparison between simple alkanes (0.54) and more complex aromatics, and the fact that biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic system with two rings, a value in the positive range, possibly similar to or slightly higher than simple alkanes, seems reasonable. It's not as "complex" or "rigid" as the highly negative examples, nor as "large" or "highly conjugated" as the very high positive examples.

Considering the general trend of increasing value with increasing aromaticity/conjugation, but not reaching the extremes of very large fused systems, a value slightly above the simple alkanes seems appropriate.

Predicted value: 0.65

True Property: -0.8457899999785877
Predicted Property:
1.  **Analyze the input molecule:** FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1. This is trifluoromethylbenzene.

2.  **Break down the molecule into functional groups/substructures:**
    *   A benzene ring (c1ccccc1)
    *   A trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) attached to the benzene ring.

3.  **Recall properties of similar molecules from the examples:**
    *   `Clc1ccc(I)cc1`, 1.36248781 (Halogenated benzene, larger halogens)
    *   `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`, 1.13913995 (Highly chlorinated biphenyl)

    *   `c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3c4ccccc4ccc23`, 2.46736791 (Another PAH)

4.  **Identify the key structural features and their likely impact:**
    *   The benzene ring itself contributes to a certain baseline property.
    *   Halogen substituents generally increase the property value, especially heavier halogens (Cl, Br, I). Fluorine is a smaller, more electronegative halogen.
    *   Alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl) tend to decrease the property value or keep it relatively low.
    *   Highly conjugated or fused ring systems (PAHs) significantly increase the property value.
    *   Oxygen-containing groups (alcohols, ethers, esters) can vary widely.

5.  **Compare trifluoromethylbenzene to the examples:**
    *   It's a monosubstituted benzene.
    *   The -CF3 group is electron-withdrawing and relatively bulky compared to a single halogen atom.
    *   The examples with single halogens on benzene (e.g., `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1`, `Clc1ccc(I)cc1`) show values around -0.5 to 1.3.
    *   The -CF3 group is more complex than a simple halogen. It's a strong electron-withdrawing group due to the high electronegativity of fluorine atoms.

6.  **Hypothesize the effect of -CF3:**
    *   Fluorine is the most electronegative element. Three fluorines on a methyl group will make the carbon highly electron-deficient, and this group will strongly withdraw electrons from the benzene ring.
    *   This strong electron-withdrawing nature might lead to a different property value compared to simple halogens or alkyl groups.
    *   Given the examples, highly substituted or large conjugated systems have high positive values. Simple alkylbenzenes or phenols have negative values. Halogenated benzenes are in between.

7.  **Refine the prediction:**
    *   Consider `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (1.36). This has two halogens, one of which is very heavy (Iodine).
    *   Consider `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (-0.56). This has a bromine and a hydroxyl.
    *   The -CF3 group is unique. It's not just a single halogen. It's a highly fluorinated alkyl group.
    *   The strong electron-withdrawing effect of -CF3 might lead to a higher value than simple alkylbenzenes, but likely not as high as the large PAHs or highly chlorinated biphenyls.
    *   It's plausible that the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the -CF3 group, combined with its bulk, could lead to a positive value, perhaps in the range of the simpler halogenated benzenes, or slightly higher due to the cumulative effect of three fluorines.

8.  **Final Prediction:** The -CF3 group is a significant electron-withdrawing group. Compared to simple alkyl groups which lead to negative values, or single halogens which can be positive or negative depending on other substituents, the trifluoromethyl group is likely to push the property value into a positive range, similar to or slightly higher than some of the simpler halogenated benzenes. A value around 0.5 to 1.5 seems reasonable based on the provided examples. Let's consider the impact of the three fluorines. It's more than a single chlorine or bromine.

Let's consider the example `CC(C)Cl` which is 1.55767011. This is an alkyl halide. The molecule in question is an aryl halide with a trifluoromethyl group. The presence of three fluorines on a methyl group attached to a benzene ring suggests a significant impact. It's likely to be higher than simple alkylbenzenes and potentially higher than some single halogenated benzenes.

Given the range of values, and the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the -CF3 group, it's likely to be a positive value. It's not a large fused system, so it won't be in the 2+ range. It's more complex than a simple alkyl group.

Let's estimate based on the "heaviness" and electron-withdrawing nature.
`Clc1ccc(I)cc1` is 1.36. This has two halogens.
`FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` has three fluorines. Fluorine is lighter than Cl or I, but there are three of them.

Considering the examples, the value for `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` should be positive and likely in the range of 0.5 to 1.5. The strong electron-withdrawing nature of the -CF3 group would likely increase the property compared to a simple methyl group.

Let's try to find a pattern for electron-withdrawing groups on benzene.
`COc1ccccc1O` (methoxy-phenol) is -0.74.
`Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (bromophenol) is -0.56.
`Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (chloroiodobenzene) is 1.36.

The -CF3 group is a strong electron-withdrawing group. This often correlates with higher values in some properties. Given the examples, a value around 1.0-1.5 seems plausible.

Let's consider the example `CC(C)Cl` (1.55767011). This is a simple alkyl chloride. The trifluoromethyl group is more complex and attached to an aromatic ring.

I will estimate a value that reflects the strong electron-withdrawing nature and the presence of multiple halogens, but not as high as large PAHs.

Predicted value: 1.25

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.09223805257799593
Predicted Property:
The molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a cyclic sugar, specifically a hexose in its pyranose form. This structure is highly polar due to the numerous hydroxyl groups and the ether linkage in the ring.

Looking at the provided examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as "OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO" (a linear hexose), have a property value of -0.09223805. This value is relatively close to zero, suggesting a moderate interaction or property.

The cyclic nature of the sugar might slightly alter the property compared to its linear counterpart, but the dominant features are the high density of hydroxyl groups and the overall polarity.

Considering the similarity to "OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO", and the general trend that highly polar, hydrogen-bonding rich molecules tend to have values around this range, I predict a value close to -0.09.

This prediction is based on the similarity to "CC/C=C/C" which has a value of -0.13638055. Both molecules are simple, unbranched hydrocarbons with two double bonds. The slight difference in the position of the double bonds and the overall chain length is minimal enough to suggest a very similar property value.

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 8.319872342535234
Predicted Property:
1.  **Analyze the input molecule:** BrC(Br)Br is tribromomethane (bromoform). It's a small, highly halogenated alkane.

2.  **Scan the examples for similar molecules:**
    *   `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` (1,1,1-trifluoro-2-bromo-2-chloroethane): Property = 2.75396471. This is a highly halogenated alkane, similar in nature.
    *   `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (Decachlorobiphenyl): Property = 2.3285167. This is a highly halogenated aromatic, showing that high halogenation can lead to higher values.
    *   `Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (Pentachlorobiphenyl): Property = 0.22680678. Another highly halogenated aromatic.

3.  **Identify key structural features and their likely impact:**
    *   **Halogenation:** The presence of multiple heavy halogens (Br) generally increases molecular weight, polarizability, and often leads to higher boiling points and densities. In the provided examples, highly halogenated compounds (like the fluorinated and chlorinated alkanes/aromatics) tend to have higher positive values.
    *   **Small size:** Bromoform is a very small molecule, which might counteract some of the "increase" from halogenation compared to larger, more complex halogenated molecules.
    *   **Symmetry/Polarity:** Bromoform is a tetrahedral molecule with three bromines and one hydrogen. It has a significant dipole moment due to the electronegativity difference between C-Br and C-H bonds, and the arrangement of these dipoles.

4.  **Compare with the closest analogue:** The most similar example is `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` (2.75396471).
    *   Both are small, highly halogenated alkanes.
    *   Bromoform has three bromines on one carbon, while the example has three fluorines on one carbon and a bromine and chlorine on the other.
    *   Bromine is heavier and larger than fluorine and chlorine.

5.  **Formulate a prediction based on trends:**
    *   The `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` example has a value of ~2.75.
    *   Bromoform (BrC(Br)Br) is also highly halogenated, and bromine is a heavy atom.
    *   Given the high degree of halogenation with heavy atoms, it's reasonable to expect a positive value, likely in a similar range or even higher than the fluorinated/chlorinated/brominated example, as bromine is the heaviest halogen in the set.

6.  **Refine the prediction:** The value for `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` is 2.75. Bromoform is even more "densely" halogenated with heavy atoms (three bromines on one carbon). This suggests a value that is at least in that range, if not slightly higher, due to the increased atomic weight and polarizability contributed by the three bromine atoms.

7.  **Final Prediction:** Considering the strong influence of heavy halogen atoms on the property, and comparing it to the `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` example, a value around 3.0 seems plausible.

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 0.4216596689279815
Predicted Property:
The molecule is an ether, specifically diethyl ether. Looking at the examples, there are several simple organic molecules.

*   **Alkanes:** C1CCCCCC1 (cyclohexane) is 0.54025145, C (methane) is 0.54025145.
*   **Alkenes:** CCCCCC=C (octene) is -0.13638055, CC1=CCC(CC1)C(C)=C (limonene) is -0.59032354.
*   **Alkynes:** CC#C (propyne) is -0.47436713, CCC#C (butyne) is -0.47436713.
*   **Alcohols:** CC(C)O (isopropanol) is 0.42165967, CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 (camphor derivative) is 0.42165967, CCCCC(C)(O)CC (3-methyl-3-heptanol) is 0.42165967, CCC(O)CC (3-pentanol) is 0.42165967. These all have the same value, suggesting a common functional group contribution.
*   **Halogenated Alkanes:** CC(C)Cl (isopropyl chloride) is 1.55767011.
*   **Esters:** CC(C)COC(=O)C (isobutyl acetate) is -0.60333569, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) is -0.60333569. These also have the same value.

The target molecule, CCCOCC (ethyl propyl ether), is a simple aliphatic ether. There are no direct ether examples in the provided list. However, the pattern for simple alcohols and esters suggests that simple functional groups might have a characteristic value.

Given the value for simple alcohols (0.42165967) and the value for simple esters (-0.60333569), and the value for simple alkanes (0.54025145), it's plausible that simple ethers would also fall into a similar range, possibly closer to alkanes or alcohols due to their polarity.

Let's consider the structure of CCCOCC. It's a relatively small, non-cyclic, saturated molecule with an oxygen atom.

Comparing it to:
*   Alkanes (e.g., C1CCCCCC1, 0.54025145)
*   Alcohols (e.g., CCC(O)CC, 0.42165967)

Ethers are less polar than alcohols but more polar than alkanes. Their properties often lie between alkanes and alcohols.

Given the consistency of the alcohol values (0.42165967) for various structures, and the alkane values (0.54025145), a value in this range seems appropriate. Without a direct ether example, I'll infer based on the closest functional group and molecular size.

The value for simple alcohols is 0.42165967. Ethers are structurally similar to alcohols but lack the hydrogen bonding capability. This often leads to slightly different, but sometimes related, properties.

Considering the simplicity and size, it's likely to be a positive value, similar to alkanes and alcohols.

Let's consider the trend:
Alkanes (C1CCCCCC1): 0.54025145
Alcohols (CCC(O)CC): 0.42165967

Ethers are generally less polar than alcohols. If the property is related to polarity or intermolecular forces, ethers might be between alkanes and alcohols, or slightly different.

Given the very consistent value for various alcohols (0.42165967), it's a strong candidate for a similar simple oxygen-containing functional group.

I will predict a value close to the simple alcohols.

Predicted Property:
The problem asks to predict a numerical property for a given molecule based on a set of examples. This is a regression task where the input is a molecular structure (SMILES string) and the output is a real number.

Let's analyze the provided examples to identify patterns or relationships between the molecular structure and the property value.

Some observations from the examples:
1.  **Halogenated compounds:**
    *   ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl: 6.27218758 (Tetrachloromethane)
    *   ClC(Br)Br: 6.90220642 (Dibromochloromethane)
    *   ClCCl: 2.85213235 (Dichloromethane)
    *   ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl: 10.80041711 (Hexachlorocyclohexane)
    *   Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1: -0.54931055 (Dichlorobenzene isomer)
    *   Fc1ccccc1: -0.84579 (Fluorobenzene)
    *   Fc1ccc(F)cc1: -0.85386083 (Difluorobenzene)
    *   Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl: -0.76672881 (Trichlorobiphenyl)
    *   Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl: -0.84793124 (Dichlorobiphenyl)
    *   ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2: -0.4084828 (DDT-like structure)
    *   COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl: -0.80625941 (Methoxychlor-like structure)

    It seems that highly halogenated small molecules tend to have higher positive values (e.g., CCl4, CHBr2Cl, HCH). Aromatic halogenated compounds tend to have negative values.

2.  **Alcohols and Ethers:**
    *   CCCCC(C)(O)CC: 0.42165967 (3-methyl-3-heptanol)
    *   CCCC(C)O: 0.42165967 (2-pentanol)
    *   CCCCC(O)CC: 0.42165967 (3-heptanol)
    *   CC(C)C(O)C(C)C: 0.42165967 (2,4-dimethyl-3-pentanol)
    *   OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O: -0.09223805 (Glucose/sugar-like)
    *   CCOC(C)OCC: 0.30833863 (Diethyl ether)
    *   Oc1cccc(O)c1: -0.74251632 (Resorcinol)

    Simple aliphatic alcohols seem to have similar positive values around 0.4. Polyols (like sugars) have values closer to zero or slightly negative. Diethers are also positive. Phenols can be negative.

3.  **Hydrocarbons:**
    *   CCCCCCC: 0.54025145 (Heptane)
    *   CC(=C)C(=C)C: -0.59032354 (2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene)
    *   c1cc2ccc(OC)c(CC=C(C)(C))c2oc1=O: 1.17554104 (Coumarin derivative with a long chain)
    *   c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45: 3.79493702 (Coronene)

    Larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) can have higher positive values. Alkanes are positive. Alkenes can be negative.

    *   COc2c1occc1cc3ccc(=O)oc23: 1.97274135 (Coumarin derivative, fused rings)

The target molecule is: **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**

Let's break down the structure of the target molecule:
*   It has a core structure that looks like a xanthene or similar fused ring system with a carbonyl group.
*   `Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)`: This part describes a bicyclic system.
    *   `c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)`: This looks like a chromanone or similar structure.
    *   `Oc2cc(O)c1...c2`: This indicates two hydroxyl groups on one of the aromatic rings.
*   `c3ccc(O)c(O)c3`: This is a catechol or hydroquinone-like ring attached to the core.

This molecule is a complex polycyclic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups (phenolic) and a carbonyl group. It resembles natural products like flavonoids or tannins.

Let's look for similar structures in the examples:
*   `Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4, 8.24229355` (Phenolphthalein-like): This molecule has two phenolic rings and a lactone ring. It has a high positive value.
*   `OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5, 11.60239404` (Very large, multiple rings, phenols, lactone, Br): This is a very large molecule with multiple aromatic rings, hydroxyls, and a lactone. It has the highest value in the dataset.
*   `COc2c1occc1cc3ccc(=O)oc23, 1.97274135` (Coumarin derivative, fused rings): This has a coumarin-like structure with an ether and a carbonyl.
*   `c1cc2ccc(OC)c(CC=C(C)(C))c2oc1=O, 1.17554104` (Coumarin derivative with a long chain): Similar to the above, also positive.

The target molecule has:
*   A central bicyclic system with a carbonyl and an ether bridge.
*   Two phenolic hydroxyl groups on one ring of the central system.
*   A dihydroxyphenyl group (catechol/hydroquinone) attached to the central system.

This molecule is quite large and has several polar groups (OH, C=O, ether). The presence of multiple phenolic hydroxyl groups and a complex polycyclic structure suggests it might have a relatively high positive value, similar to the phenolphthalein-like molecule (8.24) or the even larger molecule (11.60).

The core structure `Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)` is a chromanone derivative fused with another benzene ring, and it has two hydroxyl groups. The `c3ccc(O)c(O)c3` is a dihydroxyphenyl group.

Let's consider the complexity and functional groups:
*   **Size/Complexity:** It's a large, polycyclic molecule. Larger, more complex molecules, especially those with multiple rings and functional groups, tend to have higher values in the examples (e.g., 11.60, 8.24, 7.41, 6.27, 10.80).
*   **Hydroxyl groups:** It has four hydroxyl groups. Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups can have varied values (e.g., glucose -0.09, resorcinol -0.74, phenolphthalein 8.24). The context of the hydroxyl groups (phenolic vs. aliphatic) and their arrangement matters. Here, they are all phenolic.
*   **Carbonyl group:** It has one carbonyl group.
*   **Ether linkages:** It has two ether linkages within the fused ring system.

Comparing to `Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4` (8.24229355):
*   This molecule has two phenolic rings and a lactone (ester and ether).
*   The target molecule has a more complex fused ring system, also with a carbonyl and ether, and an additional dihydroxyphenyl group.

The target molecule appears to be a derivative of a xanthene or similar structure, possibly related to natural products like xanthones or flavonoids. The presence of four phenolic hydroxyl groups and a complex polycyclic structure suggests a higher value.

Given the values for large, complex molecules with multiple polar groups:
*   11.60239404 (very large, multiple rings, phenols, lactone, Br)
*   8.24229355 (Phenolphthalein-like, two phenols, lactone)
*   7.41066868 (Dihydropyridine, complex, nitro, esters)
*   10.80041711 (Hexachlorocyclohexane, highly halogenated, cyclic)

The target molecule is structurally similar in complexity and functional group density to the phenolphthalein-like molecule (8.24). It has more hydroxyl groups (4 vs 2) and a slightly different core, but the overall size and nature of the functional groups are comparable. The additional dihydroxyphenyl group and the specific fused ring system might push the value higher than 8.24, but likely not as high as 11.60 which has a bromine and is even larger.

Let's consider the possibility of it being a flavonoid or related structure. Flavonoids often have multiple hydroxyl groups.
For example, a typical flavonoid structure might have values in a similar range.

The molecule is a derivative of a xanthenone or chromone with multiple hydroxyl groups.
The structure can be drawn as:
```
      O
     //
    C
   / \
  C   C
 /     \
O       C - C - C - C(OH) - C(OH)
|       |
C       C
 \     /
  C---C
  |   |
  OH  OH
```
This is a simplified representation. The SMILES `Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3` indicates:
*   A benzene ring `c2` with two OH groups `Oc2cc(O)`.
*   Fused to `c2` is `c1`.
*   `c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)`: This forms a chromanone-like ring system. `Oc1c2` is the ether bridge.
*   Attached to the `CC` part of the chromanone is `c3ccc(O)c(O)c3`, which is a dihydroxyphenyl group.

So, it's a complex polycyclic molecule with 4 phenolic hydroxyl groups.
The molecule `Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4` (8.24) has 2 phenolic OH groups and a lactone.
The target molecule has 4 phenolic OH groups and a ketone/ether system.

The property seems to increase with size, complexity, and the presence of certain functional groups (e.g., multiple halogens, multiple aromatic rings, multiple hydroxyls in specific contexts).

Given the high value for the phenolphthalein-like molecule (8.24) which has two phenolic groups and a lactone, and the even higher value for the very large molecule (11.60) with multiple phenols and a lactone, the target molecule, with its four phenolic groups and a complex fused ring system, should also have a high positive value.

It's difficult to pinpoint an exact value without a clear model, but based on the trend, it should be in the higher range of the provided examples. It's more complex and has more hydroxyl groups than the 8.24 example.

Let's consider the range of values: from -0.85 to 11.60.
The target molecule is clearly on the "larger, more complex, more polar" side.

If we consider the 8.24 value as a baseline for a molecule with two phenols and a lactone, the target molecule has four phenols and a different, but still complex, fused ring system. The increase in the number of hydroxyl groups and the overall complexity might lead to a higher value.

I will estimate a value slightly higher than 8.24, but not as high as 11.60.
Perhaps around 9.0 to 10.0.

Let's try to be more specific. The molecule is a derivative of a xanthenone or a similar structure. These are often highly functionalized.
The molecule `OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5` has a value of 11.60. It has a lactone, two phenolic OH, a phenyl group, and a brominated biphenyl group. It's very large.
The molecule `Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4` has a value of 8.24. It has two phenolic OH and a lactone.

The target molecule has 4 phenolic OH groups. This is a significant number of polar groups.
The core structure `Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)` is a chromanone fused with a benzene ring, and it has two OH groups. The `c3ccc(O)c(O)c3` is a catechol group.

The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups often correlates with increased polarity and hydrogen bonding capacity, which can influence various properties.

Given the examples, the property seems to be related to molecular size, polarity, and specific structural motifs.
The target molecule is large, highly oxygenated, and polycyclic. These features generally correlate with higher values in the provided examples.

I will predict a value that reflects its complexity and high number of hydroxyl groups, placing it above the phenolphthalein-like molecule (8.24) but below the largest molecule (11.60).

A value around 9.5 seems reasonable.

Final check:
*   Large molecule: Yes
*   Multiple rings: Yes (4 rings)
*   Multiple polar groups (OH, C=O, ether): Yes (4 OH, 1 C=O, 2 ethers)
*   Similar to high-value examples (8.24, 11.60) in terms of complexity and functionalization.

The value should be significantly positive.

Predicted value: 9.5

True Property: 7.410668681409274
Predicted Property:
The molecule provided is a dihydropyridine derivative, specifically a nifedipine-like structure. Let's break down its features and compare it to the examples:

**Molecule:** `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C`

**Key Features:**
*   **Dihydropyridine ring:** This is a central feature, often associated with calcium channel blocker activity.
*   **Ester groups (COC(=O)...):** Two ester groups are present, which are common in many drug molecules and contribute to lipophilicity and metabolic stability.
*   **Methyl groups on the dihydropyridine ring:** Two methyl groups are attached to the ring.
*   **Phenyl ring with a nitro group (c2ccccc2N(=O)=O):** This is a significant substituent, and the nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group.
*   **NH group in the dihydropyridine ring:** This is characteristic of dihydropyridines.

**Comparison with Examples:**

Let's look for examples with similar structural motifs or functional groups that might influence the property.

*   **Nitro groups:**
    *   `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` (2.70537502): This has two nitro groups and a trifluoromethyl group. The value is relatively high.
    *   `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (-0.50533276): A simple nitrotoluene, with a negative value.
    *   `CC(C)N(=O)=O` (-0.68519696): Nitroisopropane, also negative.
    *   The presence of a nitro group can significantly impact electronic properties and potentially lipophilicity. In our target molecule, the nitro group is on a phenyl ring attached to the dihydropyridine.

*   **Esters:**
    *   `CCCCC(=O)OC` (-0.60333569): A simple ester, negative value.
    *   `CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC` (0.54025145): A diester with long alkyl chains, positive value.
    *   `CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC` (0.14823973): Another diester, positive value.
    *   Esters generally contribute to lipophilicity. The two methyl esters in our molecule are relatively small.

*   **Aromatic rings:** Many examples have aromatic rings, and their substitution patterns are crucial.

*   **Complex structures/Drug-like molecules:**
    *   `O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23` (3.20609588): A more complex heterocyclic system with an amide.
    *   `CCN2c1nc(N(C)(CCO))ccc1NC(=O)c3cccnc23` (4.19040767): Another complex heterocyclic system.
    *   `OC(Cn1cncn1)(c2ccc(F)cc2)c3ccccc3F` (3.79493702): A tri-substituted methane with heterocycles and fluorinated phenyl rings.
    *   These values are generally higher, suggesting that larger, more complex, and often more lipophilic structures tend to have higher property values in this dataset.

**Reasoning for Prediction:**

The target molecule is a relatively complex, drug-like structure. It contains two ester groups, a dihydropyridine ring, and a nitrophenyl substituent.

1.  **Complexity and Size:** The molecule is larger and more complex than simple alkanes, simple aromatics, or simple esters. Larger molecules often correlate with higher values in this dataset (e.g., `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` (7.11814229), `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (3.79493702)).
2.  **Lipophilicity:** The two methyl ester groups and the phenyl ring contribute to lipophilicity. While the methyl esters are small, the overall structure is not highly polar.
3.  **Nitro Group:** The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group. Its presence on the phenyl ring, which is attached to the dihydropyridine, will influence the electronic properties of the molecule.
4.  **Comparison to `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` (2.70537502):** This molecule also has nitro groups and is relatively complex. Its value is quite high. Our molecule has one nitro group but also two ester groups and a dihydropyridine core.
5.  **Comparison to `O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23` (3.20609588):** This is a complex heterocyclic system with an amide and an oxygen bridge. Its value is also high.

Considering the overall size, the presence of two ester groups, and the nitrophenyl substituent, the molecule is likely to have a positive and moderately high property value. It's more complex and likely more lipophilic than many of the negative-valued examples. It shares some complexity with the higher-valued examples.

I'd expect a value in the range of 1.5 to 3.5, given its complexity and functional groups. The presence of the nitro group and the overall structure suggests it's not a simple, highly polar, or very small molecule.

Let's consider the impact of the nitro group. While `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` is negative, it's a very simple molecule. The nitro group in the context of a larger, more complex, and potentially lipophilic structure like a dihydropyridine can lead to a higher overall property value.

Given the examples, especially those with multiple functional groups and aromatic systems, a value in the higher positive range seems appropriate.

Final prediction based on structural complexity, lipophilicity contributions from esters and aromatic rings, and the presence of a nitro group, placing it in the range of more complex, drug-like molecules.

Predicted value: 2.85

The final answer is $\boxed{2.85}$

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.4900146543206035
Predicted Property:
The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is a spiro-fused bicyclic imide. It contains two imide functionalities and a cyclopropane ring fused to a five-membered ring.

Let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples:

*   **Polarity/Hydrogen Bonding:** The presence of multiple carbonyl groups (C=O) and N-H bonds suggests significant polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. This generally leads to higher values in properties related to intermolecular forces.
*   **Rigidity/Planarity:** The bicyclic structure with the cyclopropane ring introduces rigidity. The imide groups are relatively planar.
*   **Molecular Weight/Size:** It's a relatively small molecule.

Looking at the examples:

*   **Molecules with multiple polar groups and cyclic structures:**
    *   `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` (1.71974555): This has an imide-like structure and a fused ring.
    *   `CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3ccccc23` (2.23759633): Contains an imide and fused rings.
    *   `O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23` (3.20609588): Similar to the above, with an additional amine.
    *   `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1` (-0.7056211): A single amide, not bicyclic.
    *   `ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (-0.5349807): Contains an imide and a fused ring, but also significant halogenation.

*   **Small cyclic molecules:**
    *   `C1CCCCC1` (0.54025145): Cyclohexane, non-polar.
    *   `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (0.0): Sugar-like, highly polar, many OH groups.

The target molecule has a high density of polar groups (4 carbonyls, 2 N-H) within a compact, rigid structure. This suggests a relatively high value, likely in the positive range, due to strong intermolecular interactions. The presence of the cyclopropane ring might slightly influence the overall electronic distribution and packing.

Comparing to the imide-containing examples, the target molecule is more compact and has a higher density of polar groups than `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` (1.71974555) or `CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3ccccc23` (2.23759633), which have larger aromatic systems. The absence of large hydrophobic groups (like multiple phenyl rings or long alkyl chains) would prevent a very low value.

Given the high density of polar groups and the compact, rigid structure, the property value should be significantly positive, reflecting strong intermolecular forces. It's likely to be higher than simple amides or single imides, and potentially in the range of the more polar fused-ring systems.

Considering the examples, a value around 1.5 to 2.5 seems plausible for a molecule with this level of polarity and structural complexity. The cyclopropane ring is a small, rigid feature that doesn't significantly add to hydrophobicity but contributes to the overall strain and rigidity.

Let's re-evaluate the examples with imide/amide groups:
- `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O`: 1.71974555 (Imide, fused rings, Cl)
- `CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3ccccc23`: 2.23759633 (Imide, fused rings, N-alkyl)
- `O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23`: 3.20609588 (Imide, fused rings, N-alkyl, amine)
- `ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`: -0.5349807 (Imide, fused rings, heavy halogenation)

The target molecule has a very high density of carbonyls and N-H groups in a small, rigid framework. It lacks the large aromatic systems of the higher examples, but also lacks the heavy halogenation of the negative example. The cyclopropane ring is a unique feature. The high number of hydrogen bond donors/acceptors (2 N-H, 4 C=O) in a compact structure suggests a value on the higher end for its size.

I'll estimate a value that reflects strong polarity and hydrogen bonding, but perhaps not as high as those with extensive aromatic systems or additional strong polar groups like amines.

SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 1.6380489873003024
Predicted Property:
The provided examples suggest that the property being predicted is related to the complexity, size, and presence of specific functional groups and heavy atoms (like halogens) in the molecule.

Let's analyze the given molecule: `Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`

This molecule contains:
*   A pyridine ring (nitrogen in a 6-membered aromatic ring).
*   A chlorine atom directly attached to the pyridine ring.
*   A trichloromethyl group (-CCl3) attached to the pyridine ring.

Comparing this to the examples:

*   **Halogen count and type:** It has 4 chlorine atoms. Molecules with multiple halogens tend to have higher values (e.g., `ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C4(Cl)C5(Cl)C1(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl` with 31.03, `ClCC(Cl)Cl` with 4.42, `BrC(Cl)Cl` with 5.60).
*   **Aromaticity:** It has an aromatic ring.
*   **Nitrogen:** It has a nitrogen in the ring.

Let's look for similar structures or fragments in the examples:

*   `ClCC(Cl)Cl` (4.42363818) has 3 chlorines on an aliphatic chain.
*   `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl` (0.7604698) has 6 chlorines on a benzene ring, plus a nitro group. The value is not as high as one might expect for 6 chlorines, possibly due to the nitro group or the specific arrangement.
*   `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (0.22680678) has 5 chlorines, two phenyl rings, and a CCl3 group. The value is quite low despite the halogens. This suggests that the overall molecular structure and interactions play a significant role, not just the count of halogens.
*   `CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1nc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (1.97274135) has a chlorinated pyridine/pyrimidine ring (3 Cls) and phosphorus. This value is moderately high.

The presence of the -CCl3 group is a significant feature.
The molecule has a chlorinated aromatic ring (pyridine) and a CCl3 group.

Let's consider the impact of the CCl3 group. In `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`, the CCl3 is attached to a carbon that is part of a diphenylmethane-like structure. The value is low (0.22).

However, in `ClCC(Cl)Cl`, the value is 4.42. This is a small molecule with 3 chlorines.

The target molecule `Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` has 4 chlorines.
One chlorine is on the ring, and three are in the CCl3 group.

The value seems to increase with the number of halogens, especially when they are clustered or on smaller, less delocalized systems. Aromatic systems with halogens sometimes show lower values than expected for the number of halogens, possibly due to delocalization effects or specific interactions.

Given the presence of 4 chlorines, one on an aromatic ring and three in a CCl3 group, and considering the values for `ClCC(Cl)Cl` (3 Cls, 4.42) and `CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1nc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` (3 Cls on a ring, 1.97), and `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (5 Cls, 0.22), it's a bit tricky.

The `ClCC(Cl)Cl` value of 4.42 is for a simple aliphatic trichlorinated compound.
The target molecule has a CCl3 group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group, and an additional chlorine on the pyridine ring. The pyridine ring itself introduces polarity and a nitrogen atom.

The value for `ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C4(Cl)C5(Cl)C1(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl` (31.03) is for a highly chlorinated cage structure, indicating that a high density of halogens can lead to very high values.

The target molecule has 4 chlorines, which is a significant number. The CCl3 group is a strong electron-withdrawing group and contributes to the overall halogen content. The pyridine ring adds some complexity and polarity.

Let's consider the impact of the CCl3 group. If we compare it to `ClCC(Cl)Cl` (4.42), which has 3 chlorines, our molecule has 4 chlorines. The additional chlorine on the ring and the aromatic system might modify the value.

If we consider the general trend that more halogens lead to higher values, and the CCl3 group is a significant contributor, the value should be higher than that of `ClCC(Cl)Cl` (4.42) or `BrC(Cl)Cl` (5.60).

The value for `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (0.22) is an outlier for its halogen count, possibly due to the large, extended aromatic system. Our molecule is much more compact.

Given the compact nature and the presence of 4 chlorines, especially the CCl3 group, the value is likely to be in the higher range. It should be higher than 4.42.

Let's estimate based on the number of halogens and the compact structure.
`ClCC(Cl)Cl` (3 Cl) -> 4.42
`BrC(Cl)Cl` (1 Br, 2 Cl) -> 5.60 (Bromine is heavier than Chlorine)

Our molecule has 4 chlorines. It's a compact structure.
A value around 6-8 seems plausible, considering the increase from 3 to 4 chlorines and the compact nature.

Let's try to be more specific. The CCl3 group is a strong electron-withdrawing group. The presence of a nitrogen in the ring also adds to the polarity.

Considering the values:
`ClCC(Cl)Cl` (3 Cl) = 4.42
`BrC(Cl)Cl` (3 Halogens, 1 Br, 2 Cl) = 5.60

Our molecule has 4 Cl atoms. It's a relatively small, compact molecule with a high density of halogens.
The value should be higher than 4.42.

Let's consider the impact of the aromatic ring. Sometimes, halogens on aromatic rings lead to lower values than aliphatic ones, but not always.

Given the strong influence of the CCl3 group and the additional chlorine, a value significantly higher than 4.42 is expected.

I'll estimate a value based on the increase per chlorine atom, considering the base of `ClCC(Cl)Cl`.
If 3 Cl gives 4.42, an additional Cl might add around 1-2 units, especially in a compact structure.

Let's consider a value around 6.5.

Let's analyze the provided examples to understand the relationship between molecular structure and the property.

**Observations from Examples:**

*   **Hydrocarbons:**
    *   Alkanes (CCCC, CCCCCCCC, CC(C)CC(C)C, CCC(C)(C)CC, C1CCC2CCCCC2C1): Property values are around 0.54. This suggests that saturated hydrocarbons have a positive property value, and the value is relatively consistent for different sizes/shapes.
    *   Alkenes (CCC=C, CCCCCCCC=C): Property values are around -0.136. Introducing a double bond seems to decrease the property value significantly compared to alkanes.
    *   Aromatic hydrocarbons (c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12, CC(C)c1ccccc1, C1CCc2ccccc2C1): Values range from -0.82 to 2.46.
        *   Simple alkylbenzenes (CC(C)c1ccccc1, C1CCc2ccccc2C1) are around -0.82.
        *   Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12) can have much higher values (2.46).

*   **Halogenated Compounds:**
    *   Clc1ccccc1Cl: 0.0
    *   OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl: 0.12
    *   Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl: -0.76
    *   Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl: 0.22
    *   Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl: 1.13
    *   These show a wide range, suggesting that the position and number of halogens, as well as the presence of other functional groups (like -OH), significantly influence the property. Highly chlorinated phenols tend to have higher values.

*   **Oxygen-containing Compounds:**
    *   Alcohols (CC(O)c1ccccc1, CCC(C)CCO, CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O): Values around -0.83, 0.42. Aromatic alcohols are lower than aliphatic ones.
    *   Esters (CCOC=O, COC(=O)C=C, CCOC(=O)CC, CC(=O)OCC(COC(=O)C)OC(=O)C, CCOC(=O)C=Cc1ccccc1): Values range from -0.82 to -0.11. Generally negative.
    *   Ketones (CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1, CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O): Values around -0.84, 0.14.
    *   Steroids (CC12CC(=O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO, CC1CC2C3CCC(O)(C(=O)C)C3(C)CC(O)C2(F)C4(C)C=CC(=O)C=C14, CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O): Values around -0.57, -0.35. Complex structures with multiple rings and oxygen functionalities.

*   **Nitrogen-containing Compounds:**
    *   Amides (CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1, Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, CC(C#C)N(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1): Values range from -0.83 to 2.19. Amides with complex aromatic/heterocyclic systems can have higher values.
    *   Amines (Nc1cccc2ccccc12, Nc1ccccc1O): Values around -0.29, -0.74.
    *   Nitro compounds (CC(C)N(=O)=O, O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23): Values around -0.68, 3.20. Nitro groups can lead to higher values, especially when combined with other electron-donating groups or complex ring systems.
    *   Heterocycles (Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2, Cc1ccnc(C)c1, Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1, c1ccccc1n2ncc(N)c(Br)c2(=O)): Values range from -0.84 to -0.04.
    *   Thiuram disulfide (CN(C)C(=S)SSC(=S)N(C)C): 2.37. High value.

*   **Phosphorus-containing Compounds:**
    *   Organophosphates/thiophosphates (CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC): Values around -0.45, 7.04. These show a very wide range. The second example has a very high value, possibly due to the long sulfur chain.

**Target Molecule Analysis:**

Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1

This molecule is a triaryl phosphate. It has a central phosphorus atom double-bonded to oxygen, and single-bonded to three oxygen atoms, each of which is connected to a methyl-substituted phenyl ring.

*   **Key features:**
    *   Phosphorus atom (P=O)
    *   Three phenyl rings, each with a methyl group.
    *   Ether linkages (P-O-C_aryl)

**Comparison with Examples:**

The closest examples are the phosphorus-containing compounds:
1.  `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (Value: -0.45839018) - This is a thiophosphate with an ester and an imide group. It's quite different.
2.  `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC` (Value: 7.04583424) - This is also a thiophosphate, but with a long alkyl sulfide chain. This high value is likely due to the long lipophilic chain and sulfur atoms.

Our target molecule is a *phosphate* (P=O, not P=S) and has *three aromatic rings* directly attached via oxygen. This is a triaryl phosphate.

Let's consider the general trends:
*   Aromatic rings tend to lower the value compared to simple alkanes (e.g., benzene derivatives vs. alkanes).
*   Oxygen atoms can be part of various functional groups, leading to different effects.
*   Phosphorus compounds are scarce in the examples, making direct comparison difficult.

However, the presence of three bulky aromatic rings and the central phosphate group suggests a relatively rigid and somewhat polar molecule.

Let's consider the "complexity" and "size" of the molecule. It's a fairly large molecule with 3 aromatic rings.
The examples with high positive values often involve:
*   Large, complex structures (e.g., steroids, some amides, polycyclic aromatics).
*   Specific functional groups like nitro, sulfur chains, or complex heterocyclic systems.

The triaryl phosphate structure is not directly represented by the high-value phosphorus examples, which are thiophosphates with different alkyl/heterocyclic substituents.

Let's look at molecules with multiple aromatic rings:
*   `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` (2.46) - Polycyclic aromatic, no heteroatoms.
*   `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` (-0.76) - Biphenyl with chlorines.
*   `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (0.12) - Diphenylmethane derivative.
*   `COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (-0.80) - Diphenylmethane derivative.

The target molecule has a central phosphorus atom linking the three rings. This is a unique structural motif among the examples.

Given the limited examples for phosphorus compounds, and the fact that the high value (7.04) is for a thiophosphate with a long alkyl chain, it's unlikely our triaryl phosphate will be that high.
The other phosphorus example (-0.45) is also a thiophosphate, but with a more complex structure.

Let's consider the overall polarity and size. Triaryl phosphates are generally quite stable and somewhat lipophilic due to the aryl rings, but the P=O group is polar.

Without a direct analogue, I need to make an educated guess based on the general trends.
*   It's not a simple alkane (0.54).
*   It's not a simple alkene (-0.13).
*   It's not a simple alcohol or ester (negative values).
*   It's not a simple halogenated benzene (0.0 to 1.13).

The presence of three aromatic rings and a central phosphorus atom suggests a value that might be moderately positive or slightly negative, depending on the specific property being measured.

Let's consider the "complexity" and "size" of the molecule. It's a fairly large molecule.
Large molecules in the examples have values ranging from negative (steroids) to very high positive (some complex amides, thiophosphates).

The structure is somewhat similar to a triphenylmethane derivative, but with a central phosphate.
`OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (0.12)
`COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (-0.80)

These have two phenyl rings and a central carbon. Our molecule has three phenyl rings and a central phosphorus.

Given the lack of direct analogues for triaryl phosphates, I will rely on a general sense of molecular complexity and the presence of a polar P=O group. The methyl groups add a bit of lipophilicity.

Let's consider the range of values. They span from -0.84 to 7.04.

If I had to place it, it's unlikely to be as low as simple alcohols or esters, nor as high as the very complex thiophosphate.
It's a relatively stable, somewhat bulky molecule.

Let's consider the "average" or "typical" values for molecules of this size and complexity.
Many values are around 0 or slightly negative. Some are significantly positive.

The presence of phosphorus and multiple aromatic rings might push it towards a slightly positive value, or perhaps a value close to zero, similar to some halogenated benzenes or more complex aromatic systems.

Let's re-evaluate the phosphorus examples:
1.  `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` (-0.458) - This has a P=S, two ethoxy groups, and a complex heterocyclic system.
2.  `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC` (7.045) - This has a P=S, two ethoxy groups, and a long alkyl sulfide chain.

Our molecule is a phosphate (P=O), not a thiophosphate (P=S). P=O is generally more polar than P=S.
The substituents are three aryl groups, not alkyl chains or complex heterocycles.

I'll lean towards a value that is not extremely high or extremely low, as it lacks the very specific features (like long sulfur chains or highly electron-withdrawing nitro groups) that lead to the extreme values in the examples.

Considering the general range of values for molecules with multiple aromatic rings and some polarity, a value around 0 to 1 seems reasonable.

Let's try to find a pattern for "bulky" or "complex" molecules.
*   `CCCCC1C(=O)N(N(C1=O)c2ccc(O)cc2)c3ccccc3` (5.09) - Very complex amide.
*   `O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23` (3.20) - Nitro-amide.

These are quite high. Our molecule is less "functionalized" in terms of diverse groups.

I will estimate a value based on its structure being somewhat rigid, having three aromatic rings, and a central polar phosphate group. It's not highly lipophilic like the 7.04 example, nor is it a simple small molecule.

I'll go with a value that is moderately positive, reflecting its size and the presence of the phosphate group, but not as high as the most extreme examples.

Let's consider the average of the phosphorus compounds, but that's not very representative.
Average of -0.45 and 7.04 is ~3.3. This is too high given the structural differences.

I'll consider the values of molecules with multiple aromatic rings:
*   `c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` (2.46) - This is a large polycyclic aromatic.
*   `Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1` (1.06) - Amide with two aromatic rings.

The target molecule has three aromatic rings. This suggests a potentially higher value than simple mono- or di-aromatic compounds.

I will predict a value in the range of 1 to 2.

Final consideration: The property seems to be related to some form of molecular interaction or partitioning. Triaryl phosphates are known to be relatively stable and can have some lipophilic character.

Given the examples, a value around 1.5 to 2.5 seems plausible for a molecule of this size and complexity with three aromatic rings and a polar phosphate core.

Let's try to be more specific. The methyl groups add a bit of lipophilicity compared to unsubstituted triphenyl phosphate.

I will choose a value that is positive and reflects the multi-aromatic nature and the phosphate group.

Predicted value: 1.8
==================================================
Iteration: 70
SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -0.8532019863464624
Predicted Property:
I will analyze the provided examples to discern patterns between molecular structures and their associated property values. I will pay close attention to the types of atoms present, the functional groups, the presence of aromatic rings, and the overall complexity and branching of the molecules. I will also consider the range of the given property values and how different structural features might influence this property.

Based on the examples, the property seems to be related to a combination of factors, including:
*   **Polarity and Electronegativity:** Molecules with highly electronegative atoms (Cl, F, O, N) and polar bonds tend to have higher values. For instance, highly chlorinated or fluorinated compounds (e.g., ClC1=C(Cl)C(Cl)(C(=C1Cl)Cl)C2(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C(=C2Cl)Cl)Cl, 11.87564927) have very high values.
*   **Molecular Size and Complexity:** Larger, more complex molecules, especially those with multiple rings or bulky substituents, often show higher values (e.g., O=C1N(COC(=O)CCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3, 7.33704295).
*   **Aromaticity and Conjugation:** Aromatic systems can influence the property, but the effect varies depending on the substituents.
*   **Presence of Specific Functional Groups:** Carbonyls, nitro groups, halogens, and certain heterocyclic systems appear to contribute positively to the property. Alcohols and simple alkanes tend to have lower values.

Let's analyze the target molecule: **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**

This molecule contains:
*   A trifluoromethyl group (FC(F)(F)-): This is a highly electronegative and bulky group, similar to the high values seen with other fluorinated/chlorinated compounds.
*   A phenyl ring (c1cccc(c1)): An aromatic system.
*   A nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O): This ring contains a carbonyl group (C=O) and two chlorine atoms (CCl, C(Cl)). The presence of multiple halogens and a carbonyl group within a ring structure suggests a significant positive contribution to the property.
*   Multiple halogens (3 F atoms, 2 Cl atoms): The presence of five highly electronegative halogen atoms is a strong indicator for a higher property value.

Comparing it to the examples:
*   The presence of multiple halogens (F and Cl) is a key feature, similar to molecules like ClC1=C(Cl)C(Cl)(C(=C1Cl)Cl)C2(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C(=C2Cl)Cl)Cl (11.87564927) or CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (2.46736791).
*   The combination of an aromatic ring with a complex, halogenated heterocyclic ring and a trifluoromethyl group makes this molecule quite polar and structurally complex.
*   The carbonyl group and the nitrogen in the ring also contribute to polarity.

Given the high number of halogens (especially fluorine and chlorine), the presence of a carbonyl, and the overall complexity, the value should be significantly positive and likely in the higher range of the provided examples. It's more complex and has more halogens than molecules like CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (2.46736791) or OCC(O)C2OC1OC(OC1C2O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (3.10331634). It also has a similar level of complexity and halogenation to molecules with values around 2-3.

Considering the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group and the two chlorines on the saturated ring, along with the carbonyl, this molecule will be quite polar and have significant intermolecular forces.

I estimate the value to be in the range of 2.5 to 4.5, leaning towards the higher end due to the trifluoromethyl group and the two chlorines on the ring.

Predicted value: 3.55

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: -0.5203214430248023
Predicted Property:
The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 is a complex organophosphorus compound with two thiophosphate ester groups and a central diphenyl sulfide linkage.

Let's break down the structural features and compare them to the provided examples:

*   **Thiophosphate esters (P=S(OR)2):** These groups are present in molecules like COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 (0.25365464). This suggests a positive contribution to the property.
*   **Aromatic rings (phenyl groups):** Present in many examples, contributing varying values depending on substitution. For instance, c1ccccc1 is -0.82157751, while substituted benzenes can be positive or negative.
*   **Ether linkages (-O-):** Present in some molecules, e.g., COc1ncnc2nccnc12 (0.36434031).
*   **Sulfide linkage (-S-):** This is a less common feature in the examples. However, CCSSCC has a very high value (3.46880962), suggesting that sulfur atoms, especially in a chain or bridging capacity, can significantly increase the property.

Considering the presence of two bulky thiophosphate ester groups and a central sulfide bridge connecting two phenyl rings, the molecule is quite large and has a high degree of complexity and potentially high polarizability due to the sulfur and phosphorus atoms.

Let's look at the examples again:
*   COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1: 0.25365464 (one thiophosphate, one phenyl, one sulfur in a chain)
*   CCSSCC: 3.46880962 (two sulfurs in a chain)
*   ClC1(C(=O)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C14Cl)C5(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C45Cl: 19.20808032 (highly chlorinated, very bulky, many heavy atoms)

The target molecule has two thiophosphate groups, which are similar to the one in the 0.25365464 example. It also has a sulfur atom bridging two phenyl rings, which is somewhat analogous to the sulfur in CCSSCC, but here it's part of a larger aromatic system. The overall size and number of heavy atoms (P, S, O, C) are significant.

The presence of two thiophosphate groups and a central sulfur bridge suggests a value higher than the single thiophosphate example (0.25365464). The sulfide linkage, even within an aromatic system, is likely to contribute positively, perhaps not as dramatically as in an aliphatic chain (CCSSCC), but still significantly.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple heavy atoms and functional groups known to increase the property, a value in the positive range, potentially higher than 1, seems plausible. The molecule is quite large and has a high molecular weight, which often correlates with higher values for this property.

Let's consider the contributions:
- Two thiophosphate groups: likely contribute positively, perhaps around 0.2-0.3 each, so ~0.4-0.6.
- Two phenyl rings: can be negative or positive depending on substitution, but here they are part of a larger, complex structure.
- Sulfide bridge: likely contributes positively, perhaps in the range of 0.5-1.0 or more, given the high value for CCSSCC.

Combining these, a value around 1.0 to 2.0 seems reasonable. It's not as extremely bulky or halogenated as the 19.208 example, but it's more complex and heavier than many of the simpler aromatic or aliphatic examples.

Final prediction based on the structural features and comparison to the provided examples, particularly the presence of multiple heavy atoms (P, S) and a large, complex structure.

True Property: -0.724727555969968
Predicted Property:
The molecule provided is a complex carbohydrate structure, likely a polysaccharide or a highly branched oligosaccharide, given the repeating sugar units (indicated by "OC" and "C1OC...C1O"). The examples provided show a range of values, with simpler, smaller molecules generally having values closer to zero or negative, and larger, more complex, or highly halogenated/aromatic molecules having more positive values.

Let's break down the structure:
`OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O`

This appears to be a glucose unit (C1OC...C1O) linked to another glucose unit (OC2OC...C2O), which is further linked to a third glucose unit (OC3OC...C3O). The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups (OH) and ether linkages (O) is characteristic of sugars.

Looking at the examples:
*   `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (a simple cyclic sugar, likely glucose or a derivative) has a value of `0.0`.
*   `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (a barbiturate derivative, somewhat complex but not a sugar) has `-0.49001465`.
*   `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` (a very long alkane) has `0.54025145`.

The given molecule is significantly larger and more complex than the simple cyclic sugar example (`C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O`). It's essentially three linked sugar units, making it a trisaccharide or a similar oligosaccharide.

Compared to the simple sugar (0.0), this molecule is much larger and has more atoms and more complex branching. However, it lacks the highly electronegative atoms (Cl, F, Br) or extensive aromatic systems that lead to very high positive values in the examples. It also doesn't have the features (like multiple nitrogen atoms in specific arrangements, or highly branched aliphatic chains with specific functional groups) that lead to very negative values.

The value for `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` (a very long alkane) is `0.54025145`. This molecule is also quite large. The sugar molecule, while large, is also highly polar due to the many hydroxyl groups, which might influence the property differently than a non-polar alkane.

Given its size and complexity, being a trisaccharide, it should have a value somewhat higher than a monosaccharide (0.0). It's not as "dense" or "rigid" as some of the highly substituted aromatic compounds, nor is it a simple linear alkane.

Considering the increase in size and complexity from a monosaccharide (0.0) to a trisaccharide, a moderate positive value would be expected. It won't be as high as the highly halogenated or polycyclic aromatic compounds, but it should be greater than 0.0.

Let's estimate based on the increase in molecular weight and complexity from a single sugar unit. If a single sugar is 0.0, a larger sugar structure would likely be positive.

A reasonable prediction would be a small positive value, reflecting its increased size and complexity compared to a monosaccharide, but not reaching the high values seen for highly substituted or aromatic compounds.

True Property: 8.712707620032583
Predicted Property:
The molecule provided is a complex natural product, likely a type of lignan or a related polycyclic ether. Let's break down its structural features and compare them to the provided examples to predict its property.

**Analysis of the Target Molecule:**
`COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67`

*   **Methoxy groups (OMe):** Two methoxy groups on the central benzene ring.
*   **Hydroxyl group (OH):** One hydroxyl group on the central benzene ring.
*   **Benzene rings:** Multiple aromatic rings.
*   **Lactone ring:** A five-membered lactone ring (COC2=O).
*   **Multiple fused/spiro/bridged ring systems:** This is the most striking feature. There are several fused and bridged ether rings, including a complex spiro-like system involving a dioxolane (OCOc5) and other cyclic ethers. The presence of multiple oxygen atoms within these rings is significant.
*   **High degree of cyclization and oxygen content:** The molecule is highly rigid and contains many oxygen atoms, often in ether linkages.

**Comparison with Examples:**

Let's look for examples with similar characteristics, particularly high molecular complexity, multiple rings, and significant oxygen content.

*   `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3, 7.33704295`
    *   This molecule has a high value, and it's a large, complex molecule with multiple rings and oxygen atoms (amides, esters).
*   `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3, 7.33704295`
    *   Similar to the above, also a high value.
*   `c2ccc1nc(ccc1c2)c4ccc3ccccc3n4 , 4.60201998`
    *   This is a large polycyclic aromatic system, indicating that large, rigid, multi-ring systems can have high values.
*   `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl, 4.60201998`
    *   This is a highly chlorinated small molecule, showing that high electronegativity/polarizability can lead to high values.
*   `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, 4.60201998`
    *   Another example with heavy atoms (Cl, I, P, S) and multiple rings.
*   `CCN2c1ncccc1N(CC)C(=O)c3cccnc23 , 2.90171031`
    *   A large, multi-ring nitrogen-containing heterocycle.
*   `CCN2c1cc(OC)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23 , 3.57620107`
    *   Similar to the above, with methoxy and methyl groups.
*   `O=c2c(C3CCCc4ccccc43)c(O)c1ccccc1o2 , 3.52234063`
    *   A large, fused ring system with oxygen and a spiro-like connection. This is quite relevant.
*   `OCC(O)C2OC1OC(OC1C2O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl , 3.10331634`
    *   A sugar derivative with a trichloromethyl group. The high value here is likely due to the chlorine atoms, but it also shows that complex polyols/ethers can have moderate to high values.

**Reasoning for Prediction:**

The target molecule is exceptionally complex, featuring:
1.  **Multiple aromatic rings:** These contribute to rigidity and potential for interactions.
2.  **Extensive polycyclic ether systems:** The presence of many fused and bridged oxygen-containing rings (lactone, dioxolane, other cyclic ethers) suggests a highly rigid and compact structure.
3.  **High oxygen content:** Many oxygen atoms in various functional groups (ethers, hydroxyl, lactone).

The examples with high positive values (e.g., 7.33, 4.60, 3.57, 3.52) generally correspond to:
*   Very large, complex molecules.
*   Molecules with multiple fused or spiro ring systems.
*   Molecules with significant heteroatom content (N, O, S, P, halogens), especially in complex arrangements.

The target molecule fits the description of a very large, highly rigid, and complex polycyclic ether system with multiple oxygen atoms and aromatic rings. Its complexity and rigidity are comparable to, or even exceed, some of the highest-valued examples. The presence of the lactone and the intricate network of ether rings points towards a high degree of molecular "density" and specific interactions.

Considering the examples, especially `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` (7.337) and `O=c2c(C3CCCc4ccccc43)c(O)c1ccccc1o2` (3.522), the target molecule's structural complexity, rigidity, and oxygen content suggest a significantly positive value. It's more complex than the 3.52 example and has a similar level of "bulk" and rigidity to the 7.33 examples, although the functional groups are different (ethers/lactones vs. amides/esters).

Given the extreme complexity and the presence of multiple fused/bridged ether rings, which often lead to unique packing or interaction properties, a high positive value is expected. It's likely to be in the higher range of the provided examples.

Predicted value: 6.85
