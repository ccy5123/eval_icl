SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 3.3001000000000023
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property seems to correlate with the size and complexity of the molecule, particularly the number of carbon atoms and the presence of halogens. Molecules with longer carbon chains generally have higher values.

Let's look at the example:
CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, 4.0803

This molecule has 12 carbons in the main chain plus one in the ester group, totaling 13 carbons.

The target molecule is:
CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC

This molecule has 10 carbons in the main chain plus one in the ester group, totaling 11 carbons.

Comparing it to the example:
- CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (13 carbons) has a value of 4.0803.
- CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (11 carbons) is slightly smaller.

Given the trend, a slightly smaller molecule would likely have a slightly lower property value.

Considering the difference in chain length (13 vs 11 carbons), a reasonable estimation would be a value slightly less than 4.0803.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 3.353600000000002
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property seems to correlate with the size, complexity, and aromaticity of the molecule. Larger, more rigid, and more aromatic systems tend to have higher property values.

Let's analyze the given molecule: `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`

This molecule is biphenyl, consisting of two benzene rings directly linked.

Comparing it to the examples:

*   `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67` (coronene, 6.9192): This is a very large, highly aromatic, and planar molecule.
*   `Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34` (a substituted phenanthrene derivative, 4.7284): This is also a large, fused aromatic system.
*   `Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1` (a substituted phenanthrene, 4.30142): Another large, fused aromatic system.
*   `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (DDT, 6.4955): This is a large molecule with two aromatic rings and a significant number of heavy atoms (Cl).
*   `C1CCc2ccccc2C1` (tetralin, 2.5654): A fused ring system, but one ring is saturated, making it less aromatic and smaller than biphenyl in terms of aromatic character.
*   `Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C` (9,10-dimethylanthracene, 3.45664): A three-ring fused aromatic system.

Biphenyl is a two-ring aromatic system. It is larger and more aromatic than a single benzene ring (which is not directly given but would likely have a lower value than biphenyl). It is smaller and less complex than the fused three-ring systems (like anthracene derivatives) or larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (like coronene).

Considering the values for molecules with two or more aromatic rings:
*   `Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1` (phenanthrene derivative): 4.30142
*   `Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34` (phenanthrene derivative): 4.7284
*   `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (DDT): 6.4955 (has two aromatic rings, but also a bulky chlorinated aliphatic part)
*   `Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C` (dimethylanthracene): 3.45664

Biphenyl is simpler than DDT and the fused three-ring systems. It's more complex than a single benzene ring. Its value should be higher than simple alkanes or small molecules, and lower than large fused aromatic systems or highly substituted large molecules.

Given the examples, a value in the range of 3.5 to 4.5 seems reasonable for a two-ring aromatic system like biphenyl, especially when compared to the three-ring systems (3.45-4.7) and the highly substituted DDT (6.49). It's more "aromatic" and larger than tetralin (2.5654).

Let's consider the increase in value with increasing aromaticity and size.
A single benzene ring (not given, but conceptually smaller) would be lower.
Biphenyl (two rings) should be higher than a single ring, but lower than three fused rings.
The values for three fused rings are around 3.4-4.7. Biphenyl is a bit less compact than fused rings.

A reasonable estimate would be slightly lower than the simpler three-ring fused systems, but significantly higher than simple alkanes or single-ring systems.

Let's estimate based on the trend:
*   `CCCCCCC` (alkane): 2.9767
*   `C1CCc2ccccc2C1` (tetralin, one aromatic, one saturated ring): 2.5654
*   `Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C` (dimethylanthracene, 3 fused rings): 3.45664
*   `Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1` (phenanthrene derivative, 3 fused rings): 4.30142

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 2.705400000000001
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property seems to correlate with the size, complexity, and lipophilicity of the molecule. Aromatic rings and longer alkyl chains generally lead to higher values, while polar groups (like multiple hydroxyls) can decrease the value. Halogenation, especially with heavier halogens, tends to increase the value.

Let's analyze FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1:
*   It has a benzene ring (c1ccccc1), which contributes to a higher value.
*   It has a trifluoromethyl group (CF3). Fluorine is a halogen, and while it's the smallest, the presence of three of them will significantly increase the lipophilicity and overall size compared to a simple methyl group.

Comparing it to similar structures:
*   `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` has a value of 2.9446. This has two halogens on a benzene ring.
*   `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl` has a value of 5.9672. This is a biphenyl with multiple chlorines.
*   `CCc1ccccc1CC` has a value of 2.8114. This is a benzene ring with two ethyl groups.

The trifluoromethyl group is quite bulky and electron-withdrawing, making the molecule more lipophilic than a simple methylbenzene (toluene, which would likely be around 2.0-2.5 based on `CCCCC`, `CCCCO`, `CCCCCCCCO`). The three fluorines will contribute more to the value than a single chlorine or even two ethyl groups.

Considering the examples, a single benzene ring with a bulky, lipophilic group like CF3 should fall in a range higher than simple alkylbenzenes and potentially comparable to or slightly higher than a disubstituted halogenated benzene.

Given the examples, a value in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 seems plausible. The CF3 group is quite lipophilic.

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 2.4547
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property seems to correlate with molecular size, complexity, and the presence of heavy atoms or aromatic systems.

Let's analyze the given molecule: **BrC(Br)Br** (Tribromomethane or Bromoform).

*   It is a small molecule.
*   It contains three heavy bromine atoms.
*   It is a saturated, non-aromatic compound.

Comparing it to the examples:

*   **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (7.9274) and **Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (6.6206) are much larger and contain many chlorine atoms, leading to high values.
*   **Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (3.6023) and **Ic1cccc2ccccc12** (3.4444) are aromatic and contain heavy halogens, giving moderately high values.
*   **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (2.5085) is a small halogenated alkane with a mix of halogens.
*   **COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (2.1609) is a more complex molecule with multiple functional groups and halogens.
*   **CCC(C)C** (3.2227) and **C1CCCCC1** (2.3406) are hydrocarbons, showing that size contributes.
*   **CC(C)CO** (0.6347) and **CCC=O** (0.5953) are small, simple organic molecules with low values.

Tribromomethane (BrC(Br)Br) is a small molecule, but the presence of three very heavy bromine atoms will significantly increase its value compared to simple hydrocarbons or molecules with lighter halogens. It's smaller and less complex than the multi-ring aromatic systems or large organophosphorus compounds, but the high atomic weight of bromine will push the value up.

Considering the value for **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (2.5085), which has 3 fluorines, 1 chlorine, and 1 bromine, tribromomethane with 3 bromines should have a higher value due to the greater mass and polarizability of bromine.

Given the trend, a value in the range of 2.5 to 3.5 seems plausible. The presence of three heavy bromine atoms suggests it will be on the higher end for a small molecule.

Predicted Property:
The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is a cyclic imide with a spirocyclopropane ring. It is a relatively small and compact molecule with polar carbonyl and amide groups.

Considering the provided examples:
- Small, polar, and cyclic molecules tend to have lower values (e.g., `c1ccncc1` (1.0816), `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (-2.5823)).
- The presence of multiple carbonyl and amide groups increases polarity and hydrogen bonding potential, which can lower the value.
- The spirocyclopropane ring adds some rigidity and a small increase in size compared to a simple cyclic imide.

Comparing it to `Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12` (-0.0649), which is also small and has multiple N and C=O groups, and `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (-2.5823), which is very polar due to many hydroxyl groups.

The molecule in question has two amide groups and three carbonyl groups within a relatively small, fused ring system. This suggests a high degree of polarity and potential for intermolecular interactions, which would likely lead to a lower property value.

Given its size and functional groups, it should be in a similar range to other small, polar, and hydrogen-bonding molecules.

==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 3.3668000000000022
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property seems to correlate with the size and branching of the hydrocarbon chain, as well as the presence and type of functional groups.

Let's analyze the given examples for straight-chain alkanes and similar structures:

*   **CCCCCCCO** (Heptanol): 1.9491
*   **CCCCCCC** (Heptane): No direct example, but similar to C/C1CCCCC1\C (Cyclohexane with two methyls) at 2.8326, and CCCCCC1CCCC1 (Cyclohexane with a hexyl chain) at 3.7569.
*   **CCCC(O)CC** (Hexanol isomer): 1.1673
*   **CC(C)CCO** (Pentanol isomer): 1.0248
*   **CC(C)(C)CO** (Butanol isomer): 1.0248
*   **CCC(C)CO** (Butanol isomer): 0.6347
*   **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO** (Sorbitol): -3.5854 (Hydroxyl groups significantly decrease the value)
*   **OCC(O)C(O)CO** (Erythritol): -2.3072 (Again, multiple hydroxyls decrease the value)
*   **ClCCBr**: 1.6201 (Halogens increase the value)
*   **CC(Cl)Cl**: 1.81 (Halogens increase the value)

We are asked to predict for **CCCCCCCC** (Octane).

Looking at the trend for increasing chain length in alkanes (though not perfectly linear with the limited examples):
*   **C/C1CCCCC1\C** (8 carbons, cyclic with two methyls): 2.8326
*   **CCCCCC1CCCC1** (10 carbons, cyclic with hexyl): 3.7569

The values generally increase with chain length for hydrocarbons.
Heptanol (7 carbons, with an -OH) is 1.9491. Removing the -OH group would likely increase the value, as hydroxyl groups tend to lower the value (as seen with the polyols).

Considering the general trend of increasing values with increasing carbon count for non-polar hydrocarbons, and the fact that octane is a straight-chain alkane, it should have a higher value than smaller alkanes or alcohols.

Let's estimate based on the available data.
If we consider the increase from a 7-carbon alcohol (Heptanol, 1.9491) to an 8-carbon alkane (Octane), we expect a significant jump.
The value for a 6-carbon alkane (Hexane) is not given, but a 5-carbon alkane (Pentane) would be lower than 1.9491.

Given the values for larger, more complex hydrocarbons like `c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45` (5.7372) and `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (5.3138), which are much larger and more rigid, a simple 8-carbon alkane will be lower.

Comparing to `C/C1CCCCC1\C` (8 carbons, cyclic with two methyls) at 2.8326, a straight-chain octane might be slightly higher or similar, as cyclic structures can sometimes have different packing efficiencies.

Let's consider the increase from a 7-carbon alcohol (Heptanol, 1.9491). A straight-chain alkane of similar size would likely be higher.
The value for `CCCCCCC` (Heptane) would likely be in the range of 2.5-3.0.
Adding one more carbon to make it Octane would further increase it.

Given the examples, a value around 3.0-3.5 seems reasonable for an 8-carbon straight-chain alkane.

Let's refine the estimation.
`CCCCCCCO` (Heptanol) is 1.9491.
`CCCC(O)CC` (Hexanol isomer) is 1.1673.
`CC(C)CCO` (Pentanol isomer) is 1.0248.
`CC(C)(C)CO` (Butanol isomer) is 1.02

True Property: 1.338599999999999
Predicted Property:
The molecule provided is a complex natural product, likely a type of lignan or a related polycyclic ether. Let's break down its structural features and relate them to the provided examples to predict its property.

**Analysis of the Target Molecule:**
`COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67`

This molecule is characterized by:
1.  **Multiple fused and spiro rings:** There are several cyclic systems, including a lactone (COC2=O), multiple furan/pyran-like rings (e.g., OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O), and a complex spiro-like connection involving a benzene ring and a bicyclic system.
2.  **High degree of oxygenation:** Numerous ether linkages (methoxy, cyclic ethers), hydroxyl groups, and a carbonyl group (lactone).
3.  **Aromatic rings:** Two benzene rings, one of which is part of a methylenedioxybenzene system (OCOc5cc67).
4.  **Methyl and methoxy groups:** These are common in natural products.
5.  **High molecular weight and complexity:** This is a large, rigid, and highly functionalized molecule.

**Relating to Examples:**

Let's look for examples with similar characteristics:

*   **Large, complex, oxygen-rich natural products/carbohydrates:**
    *   `OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O` (-5.3972): This is a disaccharide, highly polar, many hydroxyls. Its value is very low (negative), indicating high hydrophilicity or low lipophilicity.
    *   `Nc1ncnc2n(ccc12)C3OC(CO)C(O)C3O` (-1.375): A nucleoside, also highly polar with sugar moiety. Negative value.
    *   `CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` (1.7816) and `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO` (3.6959): Steroids, complex polycyclic, some oxygenation. Values are positive and moderately high.
    *   `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` (4.2693): Another steroid, higher value.
    *   `O=c2c(C3CCCc4ccccc43)c(O)c1ccccc1o2` (3.9668): A complex polycyclic molecule with oxygen.
    *   `CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O` (3.6092): Another steroid-like structure.

*   **Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and some oxygenation:**
    *   `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` (4.6939): Diaryl ether with nitro groups and chlorines. High value.
    *   `c2ccc1nc(ccc1c2)c4ccc3ccccc3n4` (4.45): Large polycyclic aromatic with nitrogen. High value.
    *   `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (5.9672): Polychlorinated biphenyl. Very high value.

**Reasoning for Prediction:**

The target molecule has a very high degree of structural complexity, including multiple fused rings, a lactone, and several cyclic ether systems, reminiscent of natural products like steroids or complex lignans. It also contains two aromatic rings, one of which is a methylenedioxybenzene.

Compared to simple molecules, its size and rigidity will contribute to a higher value. The presence of multiple oxygen atoms (ethers, hydroxyl, lactone) suggests some polarity, but the overall large, rigid, and somewhat lipophilic framework (due to the multiple rings and methoxy groups) will likely lead to a positive and relatively high value.

It's more complex and larger than most
