SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 1.7408764507541836
Predicted Property:
The provided examples suggest that the property value is related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall complexity or polarity of the molecule.

Let's analyze the given molecule: `Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2`

This molecule contains:
*   Two fluorine atoms on one phenyl ring.
*   A urea-like linkage: `-C(=O)NC(=O)N-`. This is a highly polar and hydrogen-bonding capable group.
*   A chlorine atom on another phenyl ring.

Comparing this to the examples:

*   Molecules with only hydrocarbons or simple halocarbons (e.g., `CCCCCCCCBr`, `BrC(Br)(Br)Br`, `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1`, `ClCCCl`, `Brc1ccc(Br)cc1`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1`, `CC(C)C(C)C(C)C`, `C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13`, `CCCCCc1ccccc1`, `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1`, `ClC1=C(Cl)C(Cl)(C(=C1Cl)Cl)C2(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C(=C2Cl)Cl)Cl`, `CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1`, `CCCCCBr`, `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`, `CCCCCCC#C`, `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`, `Cc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`, `c1cc(C)cc2c1c3cc4cccc5CCc(c45)c3cc2`) consistently have a property value of **-0.67449076**. This seems to be a baseline for non-polar or simply halogenated aromatic/aliphatic compounds.

*   Molecules with hydroxyl groups (alcohols, phenols) (e.g., `CCCC(O)CC`, `CCCCCCC(C)O`, `Cc1cccc(C)c1O`, `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`, `CCC(O)CC`, `CCC(C)(C)O`, `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl`) often have a value of **-0.19820115**. This indicates a slight increase from the baseline due to polarity and H-bonding.

*   Molecules with carbonyl groups (ketones, aldehydes) (e.g., `CC34CCc1c(ccc2cc(O)ccc12)C3CCC4=O`, `CCCCCC=O`, `CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(=O)C2`, `C=CCS(=O)SCC=C`) show values like **0.44809815**, **-0.28979861**. The value for `CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(=O)C2` is -0.28979861, and `CCCCCC=O` is also -0.28979861. This suggests that simple ketones/aldehydes are in a similar range to alcohols, or slightly more negative depending on the structure.

*   Molecules with nitrogen-containing functional groups, especially amides, ureas, or heterocycles, show a wide range of values, often positive and significantly higher than the baseline.
    *   `CN(C)c1ccccc1`: -0.61380756 (amine, close to baseline)
    *   `Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2`: 0.26278516 (quinoline derivative with OH)
    *   `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`: 2.63218497 (pyridine with hydrazide) - **This is a very high value, and it contains a C=O and N-N linkage, similar to the urea in our target molecule.**
    *   `CNN`: 0.48350152 (simple hydrazine)
    *   `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)`: 0.10235926 (heterocycle with C=O and N-H)
    *   `CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O`: 3.45223486 (barbiturate derivative, contains two urea-like C(=O)N-C(=O)N systems) - **This has a very high value and is structurally very relevant due to the multiple C=O and N-H groups.**
    *   `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1`: 0.48350152 (thiourea derivative)
    *   `Oc1ccccn1`: 0.26278516 (hydroxypyridine)
    *   `Cc1cc(no1)C(=O)NNCc2ccccc2`: 2.5457798 (complex amide/hydrazide with heterocycle) - **Another high value with amide/hydrazide.**
    *   `NC(=O)c1cccnc1`: 1.56843914 (nicotinamide) - **High value for an amide.**

The target molecule `Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2` has a **urea linkage** `-C(=O)NC(=O)N-`. This group is known for strong hydrogen bonding and polarity. The presence of two phenyl rings, two fluorine atoms, and one chlorine atom adds to the molecular weight and some polarity, but the dominant feature for a high positive value appears to be the amide/urea/hydrazide type functionalities.

Consider `CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O` which has a value of **3.45223486**. This molecule contains a cyclic urea-like structure with two C=O groups and two N-H groups.
Our target molecule has one linear urea linkage, which also has two C=O groups and two N-H groups.

The values for molecules with similar highly polar, hydrogen-bonding groups (amides, ureas, hydrazides) are:
*   `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`: 2.63218497
*   `CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O`: 3.45223486
*   `Cc1cc(no1)C(=O)NNCc2ccccc2`: 2.5457798
*   `NC(=O)c1cccnc1`: 1.56843914

The target molecule has a similar complexity and the key urea functional group. It's a relatively large molecule with significant polarity and hydrogen bonding potential. It's more complex than a simple amide like `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (1.56843914) but perhaps less "dense" in terms of polar groups than the barbiturate derivative `CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O` (3.45223486).

Given the presence of the urea group, which is a strong hydrogen bond donor and acceptor, and its attachment to two aromatic rings, the property value should be significantly positive. It's likely to be in the range of 1.5 to 3.5, similar to the complex amides and ureas shown.

Let's consider the impact of halogens. While simple halocarbons are negative, halogens on aromatic rings with other polar groups might not drastically pull the value down from a high positive. For example, `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a value of 0.51813545, which is positive despite the chlorine.

The urea group is the most defining feature for a high positive value. The two phenyl rings and halogens add to the size and some lipophilicity, but the dominant effect on this property seems to be the highly polar, H-bonding core.

I'll estimate a value that is high, reflecting the urea group, but perhaps not as high as the cyclic barbiturate which has a more constrained and potentially more potent H-bonding network. It should be higher than simple amides.

A value around 2.0-2.5 seems reasonable, placing it between the simpler amides and the more complex cyclic urea/hydrazides.

Let's try to be more precise. The molecule has a linear urea, which is similar to the core of the barbiturate (3.45) but not cyclic. It's also similar to the hydrazide (2.63) and the complex amide (2.54). The presence of two aromatic rings and halogens adds to the molecular weight and complexity.

I will predict a value that is on the higher end of the amide/urea range, but slightly less than the most complex cyclic urea.

Predicted value: 2.35

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 3.091336309321456
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property seems to be related to the presence and arrangement of certain functional groups, particularly nitro groups, and the overall aromaticity and substitution patterns.

Let's analyze the given molecule: **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**

This molecule contains:
*   An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-)
*   A benzene ring
*   A nitro group (-N(=O)=O)

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups on aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, often significantly so.

*   `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` has a value of `0.74263619`.
*   `O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12` also has `0.74263619`.
*   `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has `1.3081747`.
*   `O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O` has `5.3796378`.
*   `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(cc1Cl)N(=O)=O` has `2.93271928`.
*   `O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2` has `5.67882732`.
*   `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C` has `9.73399409`.

The presence of the acetamide group (CC(=O)N-) might also influence the value. Let's look for similar structures:
*   `CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1` has `0.23035109`. This is an aliphatic amide.
*   `CCCCNC(=O)n1c(NC(=O)OC)nc2ccccc12` has `4.8602289`. This is a more complex amide/urea derivative.

The molecule `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` is para-nitroacetanilide. It has a nitro group on an aromatic ring, similar to nitrobenzene derivatives. The acetamide group is also attached to the ring.

Considering the values for nitrobenzene (0.74263619) and methoxy-nitrobenzene (1.3081747), the acetamide group, being an electron-donating group (though less so than methoxy due to the carbonyl), would likely increase the value compared to nitrobenzene, but perhaps not as much as a strong donor like an amine or a very complex system.

The value for `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` is `1.3081747`. The acetamide group is also an activating group, similar to methoxy in its effect on the ring, though the exact electronic contribution might differ.

Given the examples, the property seems to be related to electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro) and their interaction with electron-donating groups on aromatic systems. The acetamide group is moderately electron-donating by resonance to the ring, which would likely increase the property value compared to just nitrobenzene.

Let's consider the range of values for single nitro groups on benzene: 0.74 to 1.3. The acetamide group is a substituent that can influence this.

I will predict a value slightly higher than nitrobenzene, similar to methoxynitrobenzene, as the acetamide group also has a significant electronic effect.

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 14.651336469366381
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property values seem to correlate with the presence and nature of specific functional groups, as well as the overall complexity and polarity of the molecule.

Let's analyze the given molecule: **NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1**

*   **Guanidine-like group (NC(=N)N):** This is a highly basic and polar group. Examples with nitrogen-containing basic groups (like amines, guanidines, or highly substituted nitrogen heterocycles) tend to have higher positive values. For instance, `NNc1ccccc1` (aniline derivative) has 0.48350152, and `CNN` (hydrazine) has 0.48350152. `O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O` has 5.3796378, which has multiple polar groups including a nitro group.
*   **Sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N):** This is a very polar and acidic group. Molecules with sulfonyl groups, especially sulfonamides, often show significantly higher positive values. For example, `CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O` has 4.40294556.
*   **Aromatic ring (c1ccc(N)cc1):** The benzene ring itself is relatively non-polar, but the presence of a primary amine (-NH2) on it makes it more polar and basic.
*   **Overall polarity and hydrogen bonding:** The molecule has multiple N-H bonds, C=N bonds, and S=O bonds, all contributing to high polarity and potential for extensive hydrogen bonding.

Considering the presence of both a guanidine-like structure and a sulfonamide group, which are both associated with higher positive values in the examples, and the overall high polarity, the predicted value should be significantly positive.

Comparing to `CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O` (4.40294556) which has a sulfonamide and a heterocyclic ring, and `O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O` (5.3796378) which has a nitro group and multiple nitrogens, our molecule has a very strong basic group (guanidine) and a strong acidic/polar group (sulfonamide). This combination suggests a value that is likely higher than those with just one of these strong features.

The combination of a highly basic guanidine-like moiety and a highly polar/acidic sulfonamide group, along with an additional amine on the benzene ring, suggests a very high polarity and potentially strong intermolecular interactions.

Given the examples, especially those with sulfonamide groups (e.g., 4.40294556) and highly polar/basic nitrogen systems (e.g., 5.3796378, 20.25396749), this molecule, possessing both a guanidine-like structure and a sulfonamide, should exhibit a very high positive value.

Predicted value: 5.5

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 0.02239424359873342
Predicted Property:
The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C contains a pyrazolone ring system with a phenyl group and two methyl groups.

Looking at the examples, we can observe some trends:
- Molecules with highly conjugated systems, especially those with multiple rings and heteroatoms, tend to have higher positive values (e.g., `CN2C(=C(O)c1ccccc1S2(=O)=O)C(=O)Nc3ccccn3` at 7.63, `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C` at 9.73).
- Molecules with simple alkyl chains or simple aromatic rings often have negative values (e.g., `CCCCOC` at -0.48, `C1CCCCCC1` at -0.67).
- Molecules with carbonyl groups and nitrogen atoms in rings can have a range of values, but often positive or slightly negative depending on the overall structure. For instance, `O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23` is 0.70.

The target molecule has a fused ring system with a carbonyl group and two nitrogen atoms, which suggests some degree of polarity and potential for interactions. The presence of the phenyl group adds to the conjugation.

Comparing it to `O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23` (0.70442805), which has a similar complexity with a fused ring system, carbonyl, and nitrogen atoms, the target molecule seems to have a similar level of complexity and functional groups. The pyrazolone ring is known to be somewhat polar.

Given the presence of the carbonyl group, two nitrogen atoms within a ring, and a phenyl substituent, the molecule is likely to have a positive property value, but not as high as highly complex or highly polar/acidic structures. It's more complex than simple aromatics or alkanes, but less so than large, multi-ring systems with many heteroatoms or strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Therefore, a value in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 seems reasonable.

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 9.578399908709498
Predicted Property:
The molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 is a complex polycyclic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a lactone ring.

Let's analyze its structural features and compare them to the provided examples:

*   **Multiple Hydroxyl Groups:** The molecule has four hydroxyl (-OH) groups. This feature is strongly associated with higher property values in the examples. For instance, `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (a sugar with 5 hydroxyls) has a very high value of `10.50302995`. `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (resorcinol, 2 hydroxyls) has `0.60198581`. `Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4` (a bisphenol derivative with 2 hydroxyls and a lactone) has `2.50576571`.

*   **Lactone Ring:** The presence of a lactone (cyclic ester) `C(=O)O` is also observed. Examples like `c1cc2ccc(OC)c(CC=C(C)(C))c2oc1=O` (a coumarin derivative) has `0.55094377`. `COc2c1occc1cc3ccc(=O)oc23` (a more complex coumarin derivative) has `1.32266369`. `Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4` (mentioned above) has `2.50576571`.

*   **Polycyclic Aromatic/Heterocyclic System:** The molecule has a fused ring system, including benzene rings and a dihydrofuranone ring. This contributes to the overall complexity and rigidity.

Considering the high number of hydroxyl groups (four) and the presence of a lactone ring within a polycyclic system, the molecule is expected to have a significantly higher property value than simple hydrocarbons or halogenated compounds. It shares some structural motifs with the higher-valued examples, particularly those with multiple polar groups and cyclic structures.

The value should be considerably higher than `2.50576571` (which has 2 -OH and a lactone) and `0.60198581` (which has 2 -OH). It's not as high as the sugar example (`10.50302995`) which has 5 -OH groups and is a polyol.

Based on the strong influence of multiple hydroxyl groups and the presence of a lactone in a fused system, a value in the range of 3 to 5 seems plausible, leaning towards the higher end due to the four hydroxyls.

Predicted property value: 4.25

The final answer is $\boxed{4.25}$

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.40010114678593245
Predicted Property:
The molecule `c1ccncc1` is pyridine. Based on the provided examples, molecules with similar aromatic ring structures, especially those containing nitrogen, tend to have positive property values.

Let's analyze the examples:
*   `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (a complex fused ring system with multiple nitrogens and oxygens): 1.95486273
*   `Cc1ncnc2nccnc12` (a fused pyrimidine-pyridine system): 1.25301391
*   `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` (a fused quinoline-like system): -0.0182135 (This one is interesting, it's close to zero, suggesting that the presence of nitrogen alone isn't enough for a high positive value, but the overall structure matters).
*   `CNc1ccccc1` (aniline): -0.42136495
*   `CCNc1ccccc1` (N-ethylaniline): -0.42136495

The examples with highly negative values like -0.67449076 are typically simple alkanes, halogenated alkanes, or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) without heteroatoms or with very simple substitutions.

Pyridine (`c1ccncc1`) is a simple aromatic heterocycle with one nitrogen. It's more similar in complexity to `CNc1ccccc1` or `CCNc1ccccc1` (anilines) than to the complex fused systems. However, anilines have an exocyclic amine, while pyridine has the nitrogen directly in the ring.

Considering the values:
*   Anilines (`CNc1ccccc1`, `CCNc1ccccc1`) are around -0.42.
*   The fused nitrogen heterocycles are positive (1.25, 1.95).
*   The quinoline-like structure `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` is -0.018.

Pyridine is a basic aromatic compound. It's simpler than the fused systems but more complex than a simple benzene with an amine group. Given the quinoline-like structure is slightly negative, and anilines are negative, it's plausible that a single pyridine ring might also be slightly negative or very close to zero, but likely not as negative as a simple alkane or a fully carbocyclic aromatic.

Let's re-evaluate the trend. The property seems to increase with polarity, presence of multiple heteroatoms, and certain types of functional groups (e.g., carbonyls, nitro groups).

Pyridine is polar due to the nitrogen. Compared to benzene (which would likely be in the -0.67 range), the nitrogen introduces a dipole.

If we consider the anilines (-0.42), pyridine is a cyclic amine. It's a basic compound. The quinoline-like structure is -0.018. Pyridine is simpler than quinoline.

Given the examples, the property seems to be related to hydrophilicity/polarity or perhaps some electronic property.
*   Alcohols (`-OH`) are around -0.198.
*   Ketones/Aldehydes (`C=O`) are around -0.289 or 0.0 for esters.
*   Nitro groups (`-NO2`) lead to high positive values (0.74, 1.30, 2.18, 3.51).
*   Amides (`-C(=O)N-`) also lead to positive values (0.49, 0.65, 0.98, 2.91).
*   Phosphorus-containing compounds are positive (1.38, 1.39).

Pyridine has no -OH, -C=O, -NO2, or phosphorus. It's a basic nitrogen heterocycle. Its polarity is higher than benzene.

Comparing it to `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` (-0.0182135), which is a larger fused system with two nitrogens, pyridine is a single ring with one nitrogen. It's less complex.

If complexity and number of heteroatoms generally increase the value, then a simpler nitrogen heterocycle might be slightly less than the more complex ones. However, the anilines are negative.

Let's consider the "baseline" for aromatic rings without strong polar groups. Benzene and its simple alkyl derivatives are around -0.67.
Aniline is -0.42. The nitrogen makes it less negative than benzene.
Pyridine is a cyclic analogue of an amine. It's more polar than benzene. It should be less negative than benzene.

Given the quinoline-like structure is -0.018, a simpler pyridine might be in a similar range, perhaps slightly more negative or slightly positive, but close to zero. It's unlikely to be as negative as -0.67 or as positive as the nitro/amide compounds.

Let's try to interpolate.
Benzene-like: -0.67
Aniline: -0.42 (nitrogen makes it less negative)
Quinoline-like: -0.018 (two nitrogens, fused system, even less negative, almost zero)

Pyridine has one nitrogen in a single ring. It should be somewhere between aniline and the quinoline-like structure, or perhaps slightly more positive than the quinoline-like structure due to its compact polarity.

Considering the trend of nitrogen increasing the value from negative towards zero or positive, and the quinoline-like structure being -0.018, a single pyridine ring, being a fundamental nitrogen heterocycle, might be slightly positive or very close to zero.

Let's consider the possibility of it being slightly positive, as it's a distinct class of compound compared to simple anilines.

Given the examples, the property seems to be related to the overall polarity and the presence of specific functional groups. Pyridine is polar. It's a basic nitrogen heterocycle.

If we consider the jump from benzene (-0.67) to aniline (-0.42), the nitrogen makes it less negative. Pyridine is a cyclic amine. It should follow a similar trend.

Let's consider the value for `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` which is -0.0182135. This is a fused system with two nitrogens. Pyridine is a single ring with one nitrogen. It's less complex.

If complexity and number of heteroatoms generally increase the value, then a simpler nitrogen heterocycle might be slightly less than the more complex ones.

I will predict a value that is slightly less negative than the quinoline-like structure, or very close to zero, reflecting its polarity but simpler structure compared to the highly positive examples.

True Property: 9.733994094727317
Predicted Property:
The molecule provided is a dihydropyridine derivative, specifically a nifedipine-like structure. These compounds are known for their calcium channel blocking activity, which is often associated with specific electronic and steric properties.

Let's analyze the given examples to find patterns:

*   **Aromatic systems without significant polar groups or heteroatoms:** Generally have negative values, often around -0.67449076 (e.g., `CCCCC#C`, `c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`, `CCCCCCC`, `Cc1cccc2ccccc12`, `C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13`, `Fc1ccccc1Br`, `Ic1ccccc1`, `CC(C)c1ccccc1`, `Clc1cccc(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`). This suggests a baseline for non-polar, relatively stable structures.
*   **Alcohols and simple ethers:** Tend to be slightly less negative or even positive, but still relatively low (e.g., `CCC(O)CC` -0.19820115, `CCCC(C)(C)O` -0.19820115, `CCCC(C)O` -0.19820115, `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` -0.19820115, `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` -0.19820115, `CC(C)(C)c1ccc(O)cc1` -0.19820115).
*   **Carbonyls (esters, ketones, amides):** Can vary. Simple esters like `CCCCC(=O)OC` are 0.0. More complex ones can be positive.
*   **Nitrogen-containing heterocycles (pyridines, indoles, etc.):** Often have values around -0.40010115 (e.g., `c2c(C)cc1nc(C)ccc1c2`, `Cc1ccncc1C`). Indoles like `c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2` are -0.32483995.
*   **Nitro groups:** Significantly increase the value (e.g., `CC(C)N(=O)=O` 0.74263619, `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` 0.74263619).
*   **Complex, highly functionalized molecules, especially those with multiple polar groups, rings, and heteroatoms:** Tend to have higher positive values (e.g., `O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23` 1.53690588, `COP(=O)(OC)C(O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` 1.55187936, `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2` 3.45223486, `CCN2c1nc(N(C)(CCO))ccc1NC(=O)c3cccnc23` 4.30160197, `CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O` 5.58181493, `CC2Cc1ccccc1N2NC(=O)c3ccc(Cl)c(c3)S(N)(=O)=O` 6.13432502).

The target molecule `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C` has:
1.  A dihydropyridine ring (nitrogen-containing heterocycle).
2.  Two ester groups (`COC(=O)`).
3.  Two methyl groups.
4.  A phenyl ring.
5.  A nitro group (`N(=O)=O`) on the phenyl ring.

The presence of the nitro group is a strong indicator for a higher positive value, similar to `CC(C)N(=O)=O` (0.74263619) or `Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (0.74263619). However, this molecule is much more complex, with multiple rings and polar functionalities.

Let's look for similar complexity in the examples:
*   `O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23` (1.53690588) has multiple rings, N, O, and a carbonyl.
*   `CC(=O)C3(C)CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (0.30618981) and `CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (0.44809815) are complex polycyclic ketones/alcohols.
*   `OC(Cn1cncn1)(c2ccc(F)cc2)c3ccccc3F` (1.21155953) has multiple rings, N, O, and halogens.
*   `CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC` (1.32404766) has two long ester chains and a benzene ring.
*   `CNC(=O)Oc1cccc(N=CN(C)C)c1` (1.41769377) has multiple N, O, and a benzene ring.

The nitro group is a significant contributor to the property value. The molecule has a dihydropyridine core, which is a relatively polar and somewhat flexible system. The two ester groups add to the polarity. The phenyl ring with a nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing and polar moiety.

Considering the nitro group's impact (around +0.74) and the overall complexity and polarity, the value should be significantly positive. It's more complex than a simple nitrobenzene but less "dense" with highly polar groups than some of the very high examples (like the sulfonylurea or the dinitro compound).

The structure is a 1,4-dihydropyridine with two ester groups, two methyl groups, and a nitrophenyl substituent. This is a common scaffold for calcium channel blockers.

Let's compare it to `O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23` (1.53690588). This molecule has an amide, an ether bridge, and an amine.
Our target molecule has two esters and a nitro group. Nitro groups tend to have a larger positive contribution than simple amines or amides.

Given the presence of the nitro group, which consistently pushes values higher, and the overall complexity with multiple polar functionalities (esters, NH in the ring), the value should be in the range of 1.0 to 2.0. It's more complex and polar than the simple nitrobenzenes (0.74) but not as extreme as the very high values (3.0-6.0) which often involve multiple nitro groups, sulfonyl groups, or very dense polar arrangements.

A value around 1.5-1.6 seems reasonable, considering the combined effect of the dihydropyridine, two esters, and especially the nitro group.

Predicted value: 1.58

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 3.452234859752658
Predicted Property:
The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 contains a cyclic imide structure with an additional cyclopropane ring fused to it.

Let's analyze the functional groups and structural features:
*   **Imide groups:** There are two imide carbonyls (C=O) and two nitrogen atoms within the ring. Imides are generally polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
*   **Cyclopropane ring:** This is a highly strained ring, which can influence reactivity and electronic properties.

Comparing this to the examples:
*   Molecules with multiple carbonyls and nitrogen atoms in rings, especially those forming imide or amide-like structures, tend to have higher positive values. For instance, `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` (2.03261162) and `ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (2.17079197) have similar features.
*   The presence of a strained ring like cyclopropane might slightly alter the value compared to purely aromatic or aliphatic systems, but the dominant feature here seems to be the imide functionality.

The molecule is a bicyclic system with two imide functionalities. This suggests a relatively high polarity and potential for intermolecular interactions. The values for molecules with multiple polar groups, especially those involved in cyclic structures, tend to be positive and often above 1.0.

Given the presence of two imide groups within a relatively compact bicyclic structure, the property value is expected to be positive and somewhat high, similar to other multi-carbonyl/nitrogen-containing cyclic compounds in the examples.

True Property: 0.8324645378129518
Predicted Property:
The molecule is a triaryl phosphate with three methyl groups on the aryl rings. Comparing it to the provided examples, there isn't a direct structural analogue. However, we can infer some general trends.

Aryl phosphates tend to have higher property values than simple hydrocarbons or halogenated hydrocarbons. For instance, `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` has a value of `1.55789029`, and `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC` has `-0.2504202`. The presence of multiple aromatic rings and the phosphate group suggests a value that is likely positive and potentially in a similar range to other complex molecules with multiple rings or heteroatoms.

The molecule `COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` has a value of `-0.2504202`. This molecule has two methoxy-substituted phenyl rings and a CCl3 group. The triaryl phosphate has three methyl-substituted phenyl rings and a phosphate group. The phosphate group is a significant polar and bulky moiety.

Considering the examples, molecules with multiple rings and heteroatoms (like N, O, S, P) tend to have higher values than simple alkanes or monocyclic aromatics. For example, `CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1` is `2.12471849`, and `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C` is `4.12674524`.

The triaryl phosphate structure is relatively bulky and contains three aromatic rings, which contributes to a higher molecular complexity and potentially a higher property value compared to simpler molecules. The methyl groups are relatively small substituents and might not drastically alter the property compared to unsubstituted phenyl rings, but they do add to the overall size and lipophilicity.

Given the complexity and the presence of the phosphate group and three aromatic rings, the value is likely to be positive and somewhat elevated. It's unlikely to be as high as some of the very complex, multi-ring, multi-heteroatom structures, but also not as low as simple alkanes or monohalogenated benzenes.

Let's consider the example `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O` with a value of `1.55789029`. This molecule has a thiophosphate and two rings. The target molecule has a phosphate and three rings. The oxygen in the phosphate is more electronegative than sulfur, and the presence of three full phenyl rings (even with methyls) suggests a slightly higher value than the thiophosphate with two rings.

Another example, `CN(C)C(=S)SSC(=S)N(C)C` has `-0.54786659`. This is a dithiocarbamate derivative, which is also complex but has a lower value.

The molecule `CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` has `0.30618981`. This is a bicyclic ketone.

Considering the general trend that more complex molecules with multiple rings and heteroatoms tend to have higher values, and comparing it to the thiophosphate example, a value in the range of 1 to 2 seems plausible. The presence of three aromatic rings and a phosphate group suggests a value on the higher end of this range, or slightly above.

Let's consider the example `OCC3OC(OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C(O)C3O` with `124.15908879`. This is a very large and complex sugar derivative, which explains the very high value. Our molecule is much smaller.

The molecule `Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1` has `0.23035109`. This has two rings and a urea linkage.

The molecule `O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23` has `1.53690588`. This has three rings and a nitro group, an amine, and an amide. This is a good comparison point. Our molecule has three rings and a phosphate. The phosphate group is quite polar and bulky.

Given the value of `1.53690588` for a molecule with three rings and several polar groups, a triaryl phosphate with three methyl groups should be in a similar range, perhaps slightly higher due to the nature of the phosphate group and the three full aromatic rings.

I will estimate a value slightly higher than `1.53690588` but not excessively so.

Predicted property: 1.65

Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O is predicted to be **2.58113043**.

This prediction is based on the structural similarity to molecules with high property values, particularly those containing a combination of aromatic rings, carbonyl groups, halogens (chlorine), and nitro groups. The presence of two chlorinated phenyl rings, a carbonyl linker, and a nitro group on one of the phenyl rings suggests a significant contribution to the property, similar to the example:

*   `CC(=O)CC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2c(O)c3ccccc3oc2=O`, which has a value of `2.58113043`.

While not an exact match, the overall complexity and functional group composition align well with this higher range of values.

Predicted Property:
The molecule OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O is a complex oligosaccharide, essentially a chain of sugar units.

Looking at the examples provided, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic ether structures, characteristic of sugars, tend to have high positive property values. For instance:
*   `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (a monosaccharide) has a value of `5.69512707`.
*   `NC(N)=NC#N` (guanidine derivative, highly polar) has `5.34852891`.
*   `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC` (barbituric acid derivative, polar, multiple H-bond donors/acceptors) has `3.45223486`.

The given molecule is a disaccharide linked to another sugar unit, making it a trisaccharide or even larger, with many hydroxyl groups. This suggests a very high polarity and strong intermolecular interactions (hydrogen bonding). Therefore, its property value should be significantly high, likely exceeding that of a single monosaccharide.

Given the complexity and the number of hydroxyl groups, the value should be considerably higher than 5.69512707.

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 2.6321849691553574
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property values seem to be related to the complexity and specific functional groups present in the molecule. Simple hydrocarbons or halogenated hydrocarbons often have a value of -0.67449076. Molecules with nitrogen-containing heterocycles, amides, or other polar functional groups tend to have more positive values.

The molecule `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1` contains a pyridine ring (a nitrogen-containing heterocycle) and a hydrazide group (C(=O)NN). This combination suggests a more complex and polar molecule than simple hydrocarbons.

Looking at the examples:
*   `Nc1ccccc1Cl` (aniline derivative with Cl): -0.00983745
*   `CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (urea derivative): 0.23035109
*   `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` (phenanthroline-like): -0.0182135
*   `CCN2c1cc(Cl)ccc1NC(=O)c3cccnc23` (complex amide with heterocycles): 0.85923198
*   `O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23` (complex amide with heterocycles): 0.70442805
*   `c1ccccc1(OC(=O)NC)` (carbamate): 0.49689433
*   `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2` (guanine-like): 7.83259275
*   `Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` (nitroaniline): 2.75212488
*   `COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1` (pyrimidine derivative with amines): 3.05937983
*   `CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23` (complex amide with heterocycles): 0.40833161

The target molecule `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1` has a pyridine ring and a hydrazide group. This is a polar molecule with hydrogen bonding capabilities. It's more complex than simple benzene derivatives but less complex than some of the larger, multi-ring systems with multiple functional groups that yield very high values (e.g., 7.83, 31.16).

Considering the presence of the pyridine ring and the hydrazide, it should have a positive value, likely in the range of 0.2 to 1.0, similar to some of the amide/urea/carbamate examples. The hydrazide group is quite polar and can participate in significant hydrogen bonding.

Let's compare it to `c1ccccc1(OC(=O)NC)` (0.49689433) which has a carbamate on a benzene ring. Our molecule has a pyridine ring and a hydrazide, which might be slightly more polar or have different electronic effects.

Given the examples, a value around 0.5 to 1.0 seems reasonable for a molecule with a heterocyclic ring and a polar functional group like a hydrazide.

I will estimate a value slightly higher than the carbamate example due to the nitrogen in the ring and the hydrazide.

True Property: 41.94113593335166
Predicted Property:
The provided examples show a wide range of molecular structures and their associated property values. Analyzing these examples, it appears the property is related to some form of molecular complexity, polarity, or perhaps a biological activity, given the presence of drug-like molecules and natural product scaffolds.

Let's break down the given molecule: `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67`

This molecule is exceptionally complex. It features:
*   **Multiple fused ring systems:** Benzene rings, a coumarin-like lactone (COC2=O), and several fused heterocyclic rings (OCOc5cc67, OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O).
*   **Numerous oxygen atoms:** Ethers (methoxy, cyclic ethers), hydroxyl groups, and a carbonyl group.
*   **Stereocenters:** The complex fused ring system with multiple oxygen atoms strongly suggests the presence of many chiral centers, typical of natural products.
*   **Methoxy groups (OMe):** These are present on the initial benzene ring.
*   **Aromaticity:** Multiple aromatic rings are present.

Comparing this to the examples:
*   Simple hydrocarbons (e.g., `c1ccccc1`, `C1Cc2ccccc2C1`) have negative values around -0.67.
*   Simple oxygenated compounds (e.g., `CCCCOCCO`, `OCc1ccccc1`) are around 0 to -0.2.
*   More complex, often polar or drug-like molecules, tend to have positive values, sometimes quite high (e.g., `Cn2c(=O)n(C)c1ncn(CC(O)CO)c1c2=O` at 8.27, `NS(=O)(=O)c1cc(ccc1Cl)C2(O)NC(=O)c3ccccc23` at 10.23, `NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl` at 13.20).
*   Molecules with multiple halogens often have negative values, similar to simple hydrocarbons, suggesting a property that might be reduced by high halogenation or increased by polarity/hydrogen bonding.

The target molecule is clearly a large, highly oxygenated, and structurally intricate natural product or a derivative thereof. Such molecules often exhibit significant biological activity and tend to have higher values for properties related to polarity, hydrogen bonding capacity, or specific interactions. The presence of multiple hydroxyls, ethers, and a lactone suggests high polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The sheer size and complexity also contribute to a higher value.

Given the examples, especially those with high positive values (e.g., 8.27, 10.23, 13.20), which are also complex and contain multiple heteroatoms and functional groups, this molecule is likely to have a very high positive value. It's more complex and oxygen-rich than most of the high-value examples.

Considering its complexity, multiple oxygen atoms (hydroxyls, ethers, lactone), and fused ring systems, it's likely to be at the higher end of the observed range, possibly even exceeding the highest values seen in the examples.

Predicted property value: 15.5
