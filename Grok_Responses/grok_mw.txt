SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 186.295
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being described for each molecule is the molecular weight (or molar mass) in g/mol. This conclusion is drawn from the consistent correlation between the molecular structures (given in SMILES notation) and the numerical values, which align with typical molecular weights for organic compounds of similar complexity.

Let's analyze the molecule in question: **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC**, which is provided in SMILES notation. Breaking it down:

- **CCCCCCCCCC** represents a chain of 10 carbon atoms (decane backbone).
- **(=O)** indicates a carbonyl group (C=O).
- **OC** indicates an oxygen atom connected to a carbon, likely part of a methyl group in this context.

This SMILES string corresponds to **methyl decanoate**, an ester formed from decanoic acid (a 10-carbon fatty acid) and methanol. The molecular formula for methyl decanoate can be derived as follows:

- Carbon atoms: 11 (10 from the decane chain + 1 from the methyl group in the ester).
- Hydrogen atoms: 22 (10 carbons in the chain contribute 20 H's as -CH2- groups, plus 2 H's from the terminal -CH3 of the chain, but adjusted for the ester linkage; the methyl group -OCH3 contributes 3 H's, but we must account for the structure correctly).
- Oxygen atoms: 2 (one from the carbonyl and one from the ester linkage).

The correct molecular formula for methyl decanoate (CH3(CH2)8C(=O)OCH3) is **C11H22O2**. Let's calculate the molecular weight:

- Carbon: 11 atoms × 12.011 = 132.121 g/mol
- Hydrogen: 22 atoms × 1.008 = 22.176 g/mol
- Oxygen: 2 atoms × 15.999 = 31.998 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 132.121 + 22.176 + 31.998 = **186.295 g/mol**

To validate this prediction, I can compare it with similar molecules in the provided dataset. For instance:

- **CCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl octanoate, C9H18O2) has a molecular weight of 158.238 g/mol (calculated as 9C = 108.099, 18H = 18.144, 2O = 31.998, total ≈ 158.241, though not in the list exactly, it's close to patterns).
- **CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl dodecanoate, C13H26O2) from the list has a value of 214.349 g/mol, which matches the calculation (13C = 156.143, 26H = 26.208, 2O = 31.998, total ≈ 214.349).

The trend shows an increase of approximately 14 g/mol per additional -CH2- group in the chain (since CH2 adds 14.027 g/mol). From methyl octanoate (C9, ~158) to methyl decanoate (C11), we add 2 CH2 groups: 158 + (2 × 14) = 186, which aligns with my calculation. From methyl decanoate (C11, ~186) to methyl dodecanoate (C13, ~214), it's another 2 CH2 groups: 186 + 28 = 214, matching the provided data.

Thus, for **CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl decanoate, C11H22O2), the predicted molecular weight is approximately **186.3 g/mol**.

**Final Answer: 186.295**

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 169.567
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2. First, I interpret the property values given in the examples as likely being molecular weights (in g/mol), as the values correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the molecules based on their SMILES strings. For instance, methanol (CO) has a value of 32.042, which matches its molecular weight, and other molecules like CCC(O)CC (pentan-3-ol) at 88.15 also align with their molecular weights.

Now, let's analyze the target molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2. This SMILES string represents a chlorinated benzoxazolone structure, specifically 6-chlorobenzoxazol-2(3H)-one. To predict its molecular weight, I will calculate it based on the atomic composition:

- The base structure is benzoxazolone, which consists of a benzene ring fused with an oxazolone ring.
- Breaking it down:
  - Benzene ring contributes 6 carbons and 5 hydrogens (since one hydrogen is replaced by the fusion).
  - Oxazolone ring contributes 1 oxygen, 1 nitrogen, and 1 carbon (with a carbonyl group).
  - Total base structure (benzoxazol-2(3H)-one) without chlorine: C7H5NO2.
  - Atomic weights: C (12.01) x 7 = 84.07, H (1.008) x 5 = 5.04, N (14.01) x 1 = 14.01, O (16.00) x 2 = 32.00.
  - Total for C7H5NO2 = 84.07 + 5.04 + 14.01 + 32.00 = 135.12 g/mol.
- Now, add chlorine (Cl) at position 6, replacing one hydrogen:
  - Chlorine atomic weight = 35.45 g/mol.
  - Subtract one hydrogen (1.008) and add chlorine (35.45).
  - Adjustment: +35.45 - 1.008 = +34.442 g/mol.
- Total molecular weight for C7H4ClNO2 = 135.12 + 34.442 = 169.562 g/mol.

Rounding to three decimal places, as is common in the provided data, the predicted molecular weight is approximately 169.562 g/mol. However, to ensure accuracy, I cross-check with similar structures in the dataset. For instance, molecules with chlorine and heterocyclic rings, such as CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 (367.816), include a chlorinated benzoxazole moiety, and the chlorine contribution aligns with my calculation.

Thus, my predicted property value (molecular weight) for Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is **169.562**.

Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 89.094
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I will predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, which is isopropyl nitrate (a nitro compound with the structure of a branched alkane attached to a nitro group). The property values in the dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (in g/mol), as they align closely with the calculated molecular weights of the given molecules. For instance, Cc1cccc(C)c1C (1,2,3-trimethylbenzene) has a reported value of 120.195, which matches its molecular weight (C9H12 = 120.19 g/mol), and ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (hexachloroethane) has a value of 236.74, matching its molecular weight (C2Cl6 = 236.74 g/mol). Therefore, I will assume the property is molecular weight and calculate it for CC(C)N(=O)=O.

The molecular formula of CC(C)N(=O)=O can be interpreted as C3H7NO2 (isopropyl nitrate, where CC(C) represents the isopropyl group CH(CH3)2, and N(=O)=O represents the nitro group NO2). Let's break down the molecular weight:

- Carbon (C): 3 atoms × 12.01 g/mol = 36.03 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 7 atoms × 1.008 g/mol = 7.056 g/mol
- Nitrogen (N): 1 atom × 14.01 g/mol = 14.01 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 2 atoms × 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 36.03 + 7.056 + 14.01 + 32.00 = 89.096 g/mol

Rounding to three decimal places, as is common in the dataset, the predicted property value (molecular weight) for CC(C)N(=O)=O is approximately **89.096**.

However, I note that in the dataset, there is a molecule Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO with a value of 171.156, which corresponds to its molecular weight (C6H9N3O3). This confirms the property is likely molecular weight. For CC(C)N(=O)=O, if interpreted as a nitroalkane or nitrate, the formula C3H7NO2 yields 89.096, which seems consistent with smaller molecules in the dataset like CCCOCC (88.15 for C5H12O).

To double-check, if the notation CC(C)N(=O)=O were misinterpreted, it might represent a different structure, but based on standard SMILES-like notation, it most likely indicates C3H7NO2. Comparing with similar small molecules in the dataset, such as CCCCl (92.569 for C4H9Cl) and CCCl (64.515 for C2H5Cl), a value around 89 seems reasonable for C3H7NO2.

Thus, my predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is **89.096**.

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 346.46700000000016
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the given molecule, which appears to be a steroid-like structure with a complex ring system and functional groups. The property values in the provided dataset seem to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the molecules, as they are consistent with the expected masses calculated from the SMILES strings (e.g., for simple molecules like CC(C)Cl, the value 78.542 matches the approximate molecular weight of isopropyl chloride, which is 78.54 g/mol). Therefore, I will assume the property being predicted is the molecular weight.

The molecule in question is represented by the SMILES string: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO. Let's break down this structure to estimate its molecular formula and calculate the molecular weight.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string describes a polycyclic structure, likely a steroid backbone (common in molecules with multiple fused rings like cholesterol or testosterone derivatives). Let's analyze the structure:
- "CC12" indicates a carbon (C) connected to another carbon (C1) which is part of a ring system with indices 1 and 2, suggesting a fused ring structure.
- "CC(O)C3" indicates a carbon with a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached, connected to another carbon (C3) in the ring system.
- "C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)" describes a carbon connected to a chain or ring segment with a double bond and a ketone group (=O), and further ring closures (indices 3 and 4).
- "C2CCC1" indicates the continuation of the ring system, closing rings with indices 1 and 2.
- "C(=O)CO" at the end suggests a ketone group (=O) and a hydroxymethyl group (-CH2OH) attached to the last carbon.

This structure resembles a steroid with a 4-ring system (three six-membered rings and one five-membered ring, typical of steroids), a hydroxyl group, a ketone in one of the rings, and a side chain with a ketone and alcohol group.

### Step 2: Estimate the Molecular Formula
To predict the molecular weight, I will estimate the number of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) atoms in the molecule based on the SMILES string and typical steroid structures:
- **Carbon atoms**: Steroid backbones typically have 17 carbons in the core structure (e.g., androstane or pregnane skeletons). From the SMILES, additional carbons are present in side chains like "CC" and "C(=O)CO". Counting the explicit carbons and ring indices, there are approximately 21–23 carbons. Let's assume 21 carbons for a pregnane-like structure (common in corticosteroids).
- **Hydrogen atoms**: Each carbon in a saturated hydrocarbon contributes 2 hydrogens, but double bonds, ring fusions, and functional groups reduce this number. A typical steroid like cortisol has around 30–32 hydrogens. Given the presence of double bonds (e.g., "C=C") and functional groups, I estimate around 30 hydrogens.
- **Oxygen atoms**: From the SMILES, there are explicit oxygen atoms: one in "C(O)" (hydroxyl), one in "C(=O)" in the ring, and two in "C(=O)CO" (one ketone and one alcohol). So, there are at least 4 oxygen atoms.

A reasonable molecular formula for a corticosteroid-like molecule with this SMILES could be approximately C21H30O4 (similar to hydrocortisone or cortisone, which have molecular weights around 360–362 g/mol).

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using the estimated formula C21H30O4:
- Carbon: 21 atoms × 12.01 = 252.21
- Hydrogen: 30 atoms × 1.008 = 30.24
- Oxygen: 4 atoms × 16.00 = 64.00
- Total = 252.21 + 30.24 + 64.00 = 346.45 g/mol

However, looking at the provided dataset, there is a similar molecule: CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C, with a property value of 314.469, which corresponds to a molecular weight of a smaller steroid (likely progesterone or a derivative, C21H30O2, calculated as 314.46 g/mol). The target molecule has additional functional groups (e.g., -OH and -C(=O)CO), which add extra oxygen and possibly carbon/hydrogen atoms.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 310.687
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**. The property values in the given dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (in g/mol), as they align closely with the calculated molar masses of the molecules listed. For instance, CCCCCCCCBr (1-bromooctane) has a listed value of 193.128, which matches its approximate molecular weight (C8H17Br: 8*12 + 17*1 + 80 = 193). Similarly, other examples like ClCCCl (1,2-dichloroethane, 98.96, close to 99) and CCC(O)CC (2-pentanol, 88.15, close to 88) confirm this interpretation. Therefore, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The molecule is given as **Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2**. Let's break down the SMILES notation to understand the structure:
- **Fc1cccc(F)c1**: This represents a benzene ring (c1...c1) with two fluorine (F) atoms attached at positions 1 and 3 (ortho and meta relative to each other, based on the SMILES order).
- **C(=O)NC(=O)N**: This indicates a urea-like linkage with two carbonyl groups (C=O) connected via nitrogen atoms, forming a structure like -C(=O)-NH-C(=O)-NH-.
- **c2ccc(Cl)cc2**: This represents another benzene ring with a chlorine (Cl) atom at the para position relative to the attachment point.

Thus, the molecule is a disubstituted urea derivative with one benzene ring bearing two fluorines (1,3-difluoro) and the other bearing one chlorine (para-chloro), connected via a -C(=O)NH-C(=O)NH- linkage.

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
Let's count the atoms in the molecule:
- **First benzene ring (1,3-difluorophenyl)**: C6H3F2 (6 carbons, 3 hydrogens since two are replaced by F, and 2 fluorines).
- **Urea linkage (C(=O)NH-C(=O)NH)**: This contributes 2 carbons (from two C=O), 2 nitrogens, and 2 hydrogens (from two NH), so C2H2N2O2.
- **Second benzene ring (para-chlorophenyl)**: C6H4Cl (6 carbons, 4 hydrogens since one is replaced by Cl, and 1 chlorine).
- **Attachment points**: The first benzene ring is attached to the urea via one carbon (already accounted for in C6H3F2), and the second benzene ring is attached via the nitrogen of the urea (already accounted for in C6H4Cl).

Total atoms:
- Carbon: 6 (first ring) + 2 (urea) + 6 (second ring) = 14
- Hydrogen: 3 (first ring) + 2 (urea) + 4 (second ring) = 9
- Fluorine: 2
- Nitrogen: 2
- Oxygen: 2
- Chlorine: 1

Molecular formula: C14H9F2N2O2Cl

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded for simplicity, as the provided data shows slight variations possibly due to rounding or isotopic averages):
- C: 12.01 g/mol × 14 = 168.14
- H: 1.008 g/mol × 9 = 9.072
- F: 19.00 g/mol × 2 = 38.00
- N: 14.01 g/mol × 2 = 28.02
- O: 16.00 g/mol × 2 = 32.00
- Cl: 35.45 g/mol × 1 = 35.45

Total molecular weight = 168.14 + 9.072 + 38.00 + 28.02 + 32.00 + 35.45 = 310.692 g/mol

### Step 4: Compare with Dataset Trends
Looking at the dataset, molecules with similar complexity (e.g., two aromatic rings with substituents and functional groups) have molecular weights in a comparable range:
- **O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** (diphenyl ether, C12H10O): 170.211
- **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 102.17699999999998
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being described for each molecule is the molecular weight (or molar mass) in g/mol. The values given for the molecules correspond closely to their calculated molecular weights based on their chemical formulas derived from the SMILES notation. Therefore, I will predict the molecular weight for the molecule CCCOC(C)C using my knowledge of chemistry and molecular structures.

The SMILES string CCCOC(C)C represents a molecule with the following structure:
- "CCC" indicates a chain of three carbon atoms (propyl group).
- "O" indicates an oxygen atom, suggesting an ether linkage.
- "C(C)C" indicates a carbon atom connected to two methyl groups (isopropyl group).

Breaking it down:
- CCC is CH3-CH2-CH2- (propyl).
- O is oxygen, forming an ether bond.
- C(C)C represents -CH(CH3)2 (isopropyl).

Thus, the molecule is CH3-CH2-CH2-O-CH(CH3)2, which is propyl isopropyl ether.

Now, let's calculate the molecular weight:
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol

Counting the atoms in CH3-CH2-CH2-O-CH(CH3)2:
- Carbons: 6 (3 from propyl, 1 from the central carbon of isopropyl, and 2 from the methyl groups of isopropyl).
- Hydrogens: 14 (3 from CH3, 2 from CH2, 2 from CH2 in propyl, 1 from CH in isopropyl, and 6 from the two CH3 groups in isopropyl).
- Oxygen: 1.

Molecular formula: C6H14O

Molecular weight calculation:
- C: 6 × 12.01 = 72.06 g/mol
- H: 14 × 1.008 = 14.112 g/mol
- O: 1 × 16.00 = 16.00 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 72.06 + 14.112 + 16.00 = 102.172 g/mol

Rounding to three decimal places (as most of the provided data is formatted), the predicted property value (molecular weight) for CCCOC(C)C is **102.172**.

To confirm, I can compare this with similar molecules in the dataset:
- CCOC(=O)CC (ethyl propanoate) has a molecular weight of 102.133 g/mol, which is very close to my calculated value for CCCOC(C)C (propyl isopropyl ether), as both have the formula C6H14O despite different structures.

Thus, my prediction aligns well with the trend in the data.

Iteration: 7
SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 261.119
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I can infer that the property being predicted is likely the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) of the molecules, as the values given correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the compounds when considering their SMILES notations. The units appear to be in g/mol, and the values match the expected molecular weights for the given structures.

Now, let's predict the molecular weight for the target molecule with the SMILES notation: **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES Notation
The SMILES string **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O** describes the molecular structure. Let's break it down:
- **CCC(C)**: This represents a butyl group with a branch, specifically a 2-methylpropyl group (or isobutyl-like structure), but in this context, it is a propyl chain with a methyl branch, indicating a carbon chain of 4 carbons (C-C-C with a C attached to the second carbon, forming a 1-methylpropyl group).
- **n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**: This describes a heterocyclic ring, specifically an imidazole-like or pyrimidine-like structure with carbonyl groups. The "n1" and "c1" indicate a ring closure, forming a 5-membered ring with two nitrogen atoms. The "=O" indicates carbonyl groups attached to the carbons in the ring. "[nH]" indicates a hydrogen attached to the nitrogen. "c(C)" indicates a methyl group attached to a carbon in the ring, and "c(Br)" indicates a bromine atom attached to another carbon in the ring.

Interpreting this, the structure is a 2,4-imidazolidinedione (hydantoin) derivative with substituents:
- At position 1 (nitrogen): A 1-methylpropyl group (from CCC(C)).
- At position 5: A methyl group (from c(C)) and a bromine atom (from c(Br)).

Thus, the molecule is a hydantoin ring (a 5-membered ring with two carbonyls at positions 2 and 4, and nitrogens at positions 1 and 3) with a 1-methylpropyl group on N1, a methyl group on C5, and a bromine on C5.

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
Let's calculate the molecular formula by counting the atoms:
- **Carbon (C)**:
  - From CCC(C): 4 carbons (propyl chain with a methyl branch, i.e., C-C(C)-C, but in SMILES, CCC(C) means C-C-C with the last C having a branch C, so it's a 4-carbon chain).
  - From the hydantoin ring: The ring has 3 carbons (positions 2, 4, and 5, but positions 2 and 4 are part of carbonyls, and position 5 is substituted).
  - Hydantoin base structure: C3H4N2O2 (but we adjust for substituents).
  - Ring carbons: 3 (C2, C4, C5).
  - Methyl group on C5: +1 C.
  - 1-Methylpropyl group on N1: +4 C.
  - Total C = 3 (ring) + 1 (methyl on C5) + 4 (1-methylpropyl) = 8 carbons.

- **Hydrogen (H)**:
  - Hydantoin base (unsubstituted) is C3H4N2O2, with 4 H (2 on N3, 2 on C5).
  - Substituents:
    - Replace H on N1 with 1-methylpropyl (C4H9), which has 9 H.
    - Replace 2 H on C5 with methyl (CH3, 3 H) and Br (0 H), so C5 now has no H (since it's quaternary with two substituents).
    - N3 has [nH], so 1 H remains.
  - Total H:
    - From 1-methylpropyl (C4H9): 9 H.
    - From methyl on C5 (CH3): 3 H.
    - From N3: 1 H.
    - Total H = 9 + 3 + 1 = 13 H.

- **Nitrogen (N)**: 2 (from hydantoin ring, positions 1 and 3).
- **Oxygen (O)**: 2 (from carbonyls at positions 2 and 4).
- **Bromine (Br)**: 1 (on C5).

So, the molecular formula is **C8H13N2O2Br**.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 154.21199999999996
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am tasked with predicting a property for the molecule with the SMILES notation `c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2`, which represents biphenyl, a molecule consisting of two benzene rings connected by a single bond. The property values given in the examples appear to correspond to molecular weights (in g/mol), as they align closely with the expected molecular weights of the listed compounds. For instance, methanol (CO) has a value of 32.042, which matches its molecular weight, and other molecules like CCl4 (ClC(Cl)(Cl)Cl) at 153.823 also align with their calculated molecular weights.

To predict the property for biphenyl, I will calculate its molecular weight based on its chemical formula. Biphenyl (C12H10) consists of 12 carbon atoms and 10 hydrogen atoms. The atomic weights are approximately 12.01 g/mol for carbon and 1.008 g/mol for hydrogen. Therefore, the molecular weight is:

- Carbon: 12 × 12.01 = 144.12 g/mol
- Hydrogen: 10 × 1.008 = 10.08 g/mol
- Total: 144.12 + 10.08 = 154.20 g/mol

Looking at the provided data, I notice that molecules with similar structures, such as those with multiple aromatic rings, have property values close to their molecular weights. For example, naphthalene (C1CCc2ccccc2C1) has a value of 132.206, which is close to its molecular weight of 128.17 g/mol, and other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons also follow this trend.

Given this, I predict that the property value for biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) is approximately its molecular weight, which is **154.20**. This value fits within the range of the provided data for similar aromatic compounds and aligns with the pattern observed.

**Predicted Property Value: 154.20**

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 90.191
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am tasked with predicting a property for the molecule CCCCS, which is pentanethiol (a five-carbon chain with a thiol group, -SH, at one end). The property values given in the examples appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) in g/mol, as they align closely with the calculated molecular weights of the respective molecules. For instance:

- C1CCC2CCCCC2C1 (decalin) has a property value of 138.254, which matches its molecular weight (C10H18 = 138.25 g/mol).
- CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2 (a barbiturate derivative) has a value of 232.239, consistent with C12H12N2O3 = 232.24 g/mol.
- CC1CO1 (propylene oxide) has a value of 58.08, matching C3H6O = 58.08 g/mol.

This pattern holds across multiple examples, confirming that the property in question is likely the molecular weight.

Now, let's calculate the molecular weight of CCCCS (pentanethiol, C5H12S):
- Carbon (C): 5 atoms × 12.01 g/mol = 60.05 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 12 atoms × 1.008 g/mol = 12.096 g/mol
- Sulfur (S): 1 atom × 32.06 g/mol = 32.06 g/mol
- Total molecular weight = 60.05 + 12.096 + 32.06 = 104.206 g/mol

To refine the prediction, I can also look at trends in the provided data for similar molecules. For example:
- CCCC(C)(C)C (a branched alkane, C7H16) has a value of 100.205, close to its molecular weight of 100.20 g/mol.
- CCCCCCC(C)C (C9H20) has a value of 114.232, close to 128.26 g/mol but likely a typo or different property; however, most others align with molecular weight.
- Alkanes and related compounds in the list consistently show values near their molecular weights.

Since CCCCS is a straight-chain molecule with a sulfur atom, and no significant deviation from molecular weight is observed for sulfur-containing compounds in the list (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O at 257.273, close to its calculated molecular weight), I expect the property value to be very close to the calculated molecular weight.

Thus, my predicted property value for CCCCS is approximately **104.21** g/mol, rounded to match the precision of the provided data.

**Final Answer: 104.21**

Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 116.20399999999998
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being predicted is the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the molecules, as the values correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the compounds listed in the SMILES notation. The units seem to be in g/mol, and the values match the expected molecular weights when calculated manually for several of the examples.

Let's analyze the molecule in question: **CCCC(C)(C)CO**

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES string
The SMILES notation **CCCC(C)(C)CO** represents a branched alkane with an alcohol group. Breaking it down:
- **CCCC** indicates a chain of four carbon atoms.
- **(C)(C)** indicates two methyl groups (branches) attached to the same carbon atom.
- **CO** indicates a carbon atom bonded to an oxygen (likely an -OH group, indicating an alcohol).

Thus, the structure is a 5-carbon chain where the second carbon from one end has two additional methyl groups attached, and the terminal carbon has an -OH group. This corresponds to the molecule **2,2-dimethyl-1-pentanol** or a similar isomer. Let's write the molecular formula:
- The main chain and branches suggest a total of 8 carbon atoms (4 from the main chain + 2 from branches + 2 from the remaining chain parts in SMILES interpretation).
- Count hydrogens: For a saturated alkane with 8 carbons, it would be C8H18, but since there's an -OH group replacing one H, it becomes C8H17OH, or C8H18O.
- So, the molecular formula is **C8H18O**.

### Step 2: Calculate the molecular weight
Using standard atomic weights:
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol

Molecular weight of C8H18O:
- 8 * 12.01 = 96.08
- 18 * 1.008 = 18.144
- 1 * 16.00 = 16.00
- Total = 96.08 + 18.144 + 16.00 = **130.224 g/mol**

### Step 3: Compare with similar molecules in the dataset
To confirm the prediction, let's look at molecules with similar structures or molecular formulas in the provided list:
- **CCCC(C)(O)CC**: Molecular formula C8H18O, value = 116.204 g/mol. This is close but not exact; it might be a different isomer (e.g., tertiary alcohol vs. primary alcohol).
- **CCCCC(=O)OCC**: Molecular formula C7H14O2, value = 130.187 g/mol. This has a similar molecular weight but a different structure (ester group).
- **CC(C)CC(C)O**: Molecular formula C6H14O, value = 102.177 g/mol. Smaller molecule, lower weight.

Given that **CCCC(C)(C)CO** is a primary alcohol with the formula C8H18O, and considering the value for **CCCC(C)(O)CC** (also C8H18O but a tertiary alcohol) is 116.204, there might be a slight discrepancy due to structural differences or data inconsistencies. However, calculating the exact molecular weight yields approximately 130.224, and noting that **CCCCC(=O)OCC** (C7H14O2) has a value of 130.187, which is very close, I believe the molecular weight is the property in question.

### Final Prediction
Based on the molecular formula C8H18O and the calculated molecular weight, as well as comparison to similar entries, I predict the property value for **CCCC(C)(C)CO** to be approximately **130.22 g/mol**.

**Predicted Property Value: 130.22**

Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 142.201
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I can infer that the property being described is likely the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, given the numerical values and their correspondence to the molecular formulas. The values appear to be in grams per mole (g/mol), consistent with molecular weights of organic compounds.

The molecule in question is **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1**. Let's break down this SMILES notation to understand the structure:

- "C" represents a carbon atom.
- "c1ccc2ccccc2c1" indicates a naphthalene core, which is a fused bicyclic aromatic system consisting of two benzene rings sharing two carbon atoms (C10H8).
- "C" attached to "c1" indicates a methyl group (-CH3) substituted on the naphthalene ring.

Thus, the molecule is methylnaphthalene, with the molecular formula C11H10 (naphthalene is C10H8, and adding a methyl group replaces one H with CH3, resulting in +CH2 net, so C11H10).

Now, let's calculate the molecular weight:
- Carbon (C): 12.011 g/mol × 11 = 132.121 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol × 10 = 10.080 g/mol
- Total molecular weight = 132.121 + 10.080 = 142.201 g/mol

To validate this prediction, I can compare it with similar molecules in the provided dataset:
- Naphthalene itself (c1ccc2ccccc2c1) is not directly listed, but a related compound, **Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1** (likely anthracene with a methyl group, C15H12), has a value of 192.261 g/mol, which matches its molecular weight.
- Another similar compound, **Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12** (dimethylnaphthalene, C12H12), has a value of 156.228 g/mol, which is close to its calculated molecular weight (12*12 + 12*1.008 = 144 + 12.096 = 156.096 g/mol, approximately 156.228).

For methylnaphthalene (C11H10), the calculated value of 142.201 g/mol seems consistent with the trend. Naphthalene (C10H8) would have a molecular weight of approximately 128.17 g/mol (10*12 + 8*1.008 = 120 + 8.064 = 128.064), and adding a methyl group (CH3, approximately 15 g/mol, but effectively CH2 since it replaces H, so +14.026) gives roughly 128 + 14 = 142 g/mol, aligning with my calculation.

Therefore, the predicted property value (molecular weight) for **Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (methylnaphthalene) is approximately **142.20 g/mol**.

**Final Answer: 142.20**

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 238.28699999999995
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am tasked with predicting a property for the molecule with the SMILES notation `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C`. Given the context and the numerical values associated with the example molecules, it appears that the property being predicted is likely the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values are consistent with typical molecular weights in g/mol for organic molecules.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C` describes a cyclic molecule with specific functional groups and substituents. Let's break it down:
- `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1` indicates a six-membered ring with alternating carbonyl (C=O) and nitrogen atoms, suggesting a structure similar to a barbituric acid derivative or a related heterocyclic compound (likely a 1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-trione core or a similar structure with three carbonyl groups and two NH groups in the ring).
- `(C(C)CCC)` attached to one of the carbons in the ring indicates a branched alkyl chain, specifically a pentyl-like chain with a methyl branch (likely an isopentyl or similar group).
- `CC=C` attached to the same carbon indicates a propenyl group (an allyl-like substituent with a double bond).

Thus, the molecule is a substituted cyclic compound (likely a barbituric acid derivative or triazine derivative) with two substituents on one of the ring carbons: a branched pentyl chain and a propenyl group.

### Step 2: Estimate the Molecular Formula
To predict the molecular weight, I need to deduce the molecular formula from the SMILES string:
- The core ring `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1` likely represents a barbituric acid-like structure (C4H2N2O3), which is a six-membered ring with three carbonyls and two NH groups.
  - Carbon: 4 (three from carbonyls and one additional ring carbon).
  - Nitrogen: 2.
  - Oxygen: 3.
  - Hydrogen: 2 (from NH groups).
- The substituent `(C(C)CCC)` is a branched alkyl chain. Interpreting it:
  - `C(C)CCC` suggests a carbon with a methyl branch (`C(C)`) followed by a propyl chain (`CCC`), so it is likely `CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3`, which is a 2-methylbutyl group (C5H11).
  - Carbon: 5.
  - Hydrogen: 11.
- The substituent `CC=C` is a propenyl group, likely `CH2-CH=CH2` (C3H5).
  - Carbon: 3.
  - Hydrogen: 5.

Now, combining these:
- Total Carbons: 4 (ring) + 5 (branched alkyl) + 3 (propenyl) = 12.
- Total Hydrogens: 2 (ring NH) + 11 (branched alkyl) + 5 (propenyl) = 18.
- Total Nitrogens: 2 (ring).
- Total Oxygens: 3 (ring carbonyls).

Thus, the molecular formula is **C12H18N2O3**.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (approximate values for simplicity, as I am not using external tools):
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol × 12 = 144.12 g/mol.
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol × 18 = 18.144 g/mol.
- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol × 2 = 28.02 g/mol.
- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol × 3 = 48.00 g/mol.

Total molecular weight = 144.12 + 18.144 + 28.02 + 48.00 = **238.284 g/mol**.

### Step 4: Compare with Similar Molecules
To validate, I can compare this with a similar molecule from the provided list:
- `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C` has a molecular weight of 182.179 g/mol.
- Its formula is likely C8H10N2O3 (core ring C4H2N2O3 + methyl C1H3 + propenyl C3H5).
  - Calculated: (8×12.01) + (10×1.008) + (2×14.01) + (3×16.00) = 96.08 + 10.08 + 28.02 +

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 146.111
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I can infer that the property being described for each molecule is likely the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) in g/mol, as the values correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the given compounds when interpreted through their SMILES notation.

Let's analyze the molecule in question: **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1**, which represents trifluoromethylbenzene (C6H5CF3). To predict its molecular weight, I will calculate it based on the atomic composition.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:
- The molecule consists of:
  - Carbon (C): 7 atoms (6 from the benzene ring + 1 from the CF3 group)
  - Hydrogen (H): 5 atoms (benzene ring has 5 hydrogens since one is replaced by the CF3 group)
  - Fluorine (F): 3 atoms (from the CF3 group)

- Atomic weights (approximate values):
  - Carbon: 12.01 g/mol
  - Hydrogen: 1.008 g/mol
  - Fluorine: 19.00 g/mol

- Total molecular weight:
  - Carbon: 7 × 12.01 = 84.07 g/mol
  - Hydrogen: 5 × 1.008 = 5.04 g/mol
  - Fluorine: 3 × 19.00 = 57.00 g/mol
  - Total = 84.07 + 5.04 + 57.00 = **146.11 g/mol**

### Verification with Similar Molecules:
Looking at the provided dataset, I can compare this molecule to others with similar structures:
- **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene, C7H8) is not directly listed, but **CCc1ccccc1CC** (diethylbenzene, C10H14) has a value of 134.222, which matches its molecular weight.
- **Clc1ccc(I)cc1** (chloroiodobenzene, C6H4ClI) has a value of 238.455, close to its molecular weight (~238.46 g/mol).
- My calculated value for trifluoromethylbenzene (146.11 g/mol) seems reasonable, as it is higher than benzene (78.11 g/mol, not listed but known) due to the addition of the CF3 group, which adds significant mass from the fluorine atoms.

### Final Prediction:
Based on the pattern in the data (property values matching molecular weights) and my calculation, I predict the property value for **FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1** to be approximately **146.11**.

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 180.156
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being described for each molecule is the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) in g/mol. This conclusion is drawn from the consistent correlation between the molecular formulas (represented in SMILES notation) and the numerical values provided, which match the expected molecular weights of the compounds when calculated manually for several examples.

For instance:
- For the molecule "CCC(=O)C" (which is acetone, CH₃COCH₃), the molecular weight is approximately 58.08 g/mol, but the provided value is 72.107, which suggests a possible typo or different compound interpretation. However, upon rechecking, I realize I misread; "CCC(=O)C" is likely butanone (CH₃CH₂COCH₃), with a molecular weight of 72.11 g/mol, matching the provided value.
- For "Clc1ccccc1" (chlorobenzene, C₆H₅Cl), the molecular weight is approximately 112.56 g/mol, matching the provided value of 112.559.
- For "OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO" (likely a sugar like glucose in linear form), the molecular weight is 182.17 g/mol, matching the provided value of 182.172.

Thus, the property is clearly the molecular weight.

Now, let's predict the molecular weight for the target molecule: **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES notation
The SMILES string "OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O" represents a cyclic molecule, likely a sugar, due to the presence of a ring (indicated by the number "1" appearing twice) and multiple hydroxyl groups (O atoms). Let's break it down:
- "C1" and "C1" indicate a ring closure, forming a cyclic structure.
- The structure can be interpreted as a six-membered ring (common for sugars like glucose in pyranose form), with oxygen in the ring (indicated by "OC1" and "C1O").
- The full structure is likely a pyranose form of a hexose sugar, with multiple hydroxyl groups attached to the carbons.

Counting the atoms from the SMILES:
- Carbons: There are 5 "C" explicitly written in the ring (C1, C, C, C, C1) plus one "C" outside (in "OC"), totaling 6 carbons.
- Oxygens: There are 6 "O" atoms (one in the ring, one outside in "OC", and four from the "(O)" groups indicating hydroxyls).
- Hydrogens: These are implied in SMILES. For a hexose sugar like glucose in pyranose form, the formula is C₆H₁₂O₆.

The SMILES "OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O" can be interpreted as:
- "OC" before C1: A -CH₂OH group attached to the ring.
- "C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O": A six-membered ring with oxygen between C1 and the next carbon, and hydroxyl groups on several carbons, plus a hydroxyl on C1 after ring closure.

This matches the structure of a hexose sugar in pyranose form, such as glucose, with the molecular formula **C₆H₁₂O₆**.

### Step 2: Calculate the molecular weight
Using standard atomic weights:
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol × 6 = 72.06 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol × 12 = 12.096 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol × 6 = 96.00 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 72.06 + 12.096 + 96.00 = **180.156 g/mol**

### Step 3: Compare with provided data for consistency
In the provided data, a similar molecule "OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO" (likely glucose in linear form) has a molecular weight of 182.172 g/mol, which is very close to 180.156 g/mol. The slight discrepancy may arise from rounding or specific isotopic assumptions in the dataset, but for consistency, I note that the cyclic form (pyranose) and linear form of glucose both have the same molecular formula (C₆H₁₂O₆) and thus the same molecular weight.

### Final Prediction
Based on the molecular formula C₆H₁₂O₆ derived from the SMILES notation, the predicted molecular weight for the molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** is approximately **180.16 g/mol**. Rounding to match the precision in the

SMILES: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C 
True Property: 402.48700000000014
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the given molecule, which appears to be a complex organic compound, likely a steroid derivative based on its structure. The property values in the provided examples seem to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the molecules, as they are consistent with the calculated molar masses of the compounds when considering their SMILES notations.

### Step 1: Analyze the Given Data
The provided list of molecules and their associated property values strongly suggests that the property being measured is the molecular weight (in g/mol). For instance:
- CCCCC(=O)CCCC (nonanoic acid or a similar structure) has a value of 142.242, which matches the approximate molar mass of C9H18O (142.24 g/mol).
- c1ccncc1 (pyridine) has a value of 79.102, matching the molar mass of C5H5N (79.10 g/mol).
- OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO (glucose or a similar polyol) has a value of 182.172, close to the molar mass of C6H14O6 (182.17 g/mol).

This consistency across multiple examples confirms that the property is likely the molecular weight.

### Step 2: Interpret the Target Molecule
The target molecule is given as: CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C. This SMILES string represents a complex polycyclic structure with functional groups, likely a steroid or corticosteroid derivative. Let's break it down:
- The structure contains multiple rings (indicated by numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4), typical of steroids.
- Functional groups include ketones (=O), hydroxyl groups (O), and an ester linkage (CC(=O)OCC(=O)).
- There are also double bonds (e.g., =C) and methyl groups (C).

This structure resembles a compound like cortisone acetate or a similar glucocorticoid, which often have molecular weights in the range of 400–450 g/mol due to their large carbon framework (around 21 carbons) and multiple oxygen atoms.

### Step 3: Estimate the Molecular Formula
To predict the molecular weight, I will estimate the molecular formula based on the SMILES string:
- The core structure appears to be a steroid backbone, typically C19 or C21 for common steroids, with additional functional groups.
- Counting the explicit carbons in the SMILES (C's and ring numbers), there are approximately 21–23 carbon atoms.
- Oxygen atoms are present in multiple forms: ketones (=O), hydroxyls (O), and ester groups (OCC(=O)). I count around 5–6 oxygen atoms.
- Hydrogen atoms are implicit in SMILES and depend on the saturation of carbons. Given the double bonds and ring structures, there are likely around 30–34 hydrogens.

A reasonable molecular formula for a compound like cortisone acetate (a close analog) is C23H30O6, with a molar mass of 402.48 g/mol. However, the exact structure may vary slightly based on the SMILES.

### Step 4: Compare with Similar Molecules in the Dataset
Looking at the provided dataset, there are a few steroid-like molecules with similar complexity:
- CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C has a value of 344.495, corresponding to a structure like testosterone propionate (C22H32O3, molar mass ~344.5 g/mol).
- CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C has a value of 302.458, likely a simpler steroid (C19H26O3, molar mass ~302.5 g/mol).

The target molecule has additional functional groups (e.g., an ester and extra oxygen) compared to these, so its molecular weight should be higher than 344.495.

### Step 5: Predict the Property Value
Given the additional ester group (CC(=O)O) and hydroxyl group, the target molecule likely has a molecular formula close to C23H30O6 or C23H32O6, with a molar mass around 402–404 g/mol. This is consistent with cortisone acetate (C23H30O6, 402.48 g/mol), which matches the structural features described in the SMILES.

Therefore, I predict the property value (molecular weight) for the molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C to be approximately **402.48**.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 290.44699999999995
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**. The property in question appears to be the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values given in the examples (e.g., 157.01 for Brc1ccccc1, which is bromobenzene, with a known molar mass of approximately 157.01 g/mol) closely match the molar masses of the respective molecules when calculated.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The molecule is given in SMILES notation as **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O**. Let's break it down to understand the structure:
- This SMILES string represents a complex polycyclic structure, likely a steroid or a similar compound, due to the presence of multiple fused rings (indicated by numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4 for ring closures) and functional groups like a ketone (**=O**) and a hydroxyl group (**O** at the end, likely -OH).
- **CC34** and other numbers indicate stereochemistry and ring closures in a multi-ring system.
- **C(=O)** indicates a carbonyl group (ketone).
- **O** at the end likely represents a hydroxyl group attached to carbon 4 in the ring system.
- The structure appears to have four fused rings (common in steroids like testosterone or related compounds) with a methyl group (**C**) and functional groups.

This molecule resembles a steroid backbone, possibly a derivative of testosterone or a similar compound, with a ketone in one of the rings and a hydroxyl group.

### Step 2: Estimate the Molecular Formula
To predict the molar mass, I need to approximate the molecular formula based on the SMILES string:
- Steroid backbones typically have a core structure of 17 carbon atoms arranged in four fused rings (three six-membered and one five-membered ring).
- The SMILES string includes additional **C** atoms (likely methyl groups) and functional groups.
- Let's count the carbon atoms and other atoms:
  - The core steroid structure has 17 carbons.
  - **CC34** and other **C** notations suggest additional carbons (likely methyl groups at specific positions, common in steroids).
  - From the SMILES, there are likely 19-20 carbon atoms total (17 from the core + additional methyl groups).
  - Hydrogen atoms will depend on the degree of saturation and functional groups.
  - There is one ketone (**=O**) and one hydroxyl (**O**), contributing 2 oxygen atoms.
- A typical steroid like testosterone (C19H28O2) has a molar mass of 288.42 g/mol. This molecule seems similar but may have slight differences in substitution or functional groups.

### Step 3: Compare with Similar Molecules in the Dataset
Looking at the provided dataset, there is a molecule with a similar steroid-like structure:
- **CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O**, with a property value of 272.388.
  - This molecule is likely androstenediol or a similar compound with a molar mass of approximately 272.38 g/mol (C19H28O2 or close).
- The target molecule **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O** also has a steroid-like structure, with a ketone group (**=O**) and a hydroxyl group, suggesting a similar molar mass range.

### Step 4: Calculate Approximate Molar Mass
Assuming the target molecule is a C19 or C20 steroid with 2 oxygen atoms:
- For C19H28O2 (similar to testosterone but with different functional group positions):
  - Carbon: 19 × 12.01 = 228.19
  - Hydrogen: 28 × 1.008 = 28.224
  - Oxygen: 2 × 16.00 = 32.00
  - Total = 228.19 + 28.224 + 32.00 = 288.414 g/mol
- However, the exact structure might have fewer hydrogens due to the position of the ketone or additional unsaturation. Comparing to the dataset molecule (272.388), it might be closer to C19H26O2 or C19H28O2 with slight variations.

### Step 5: Final Prediction
Given the similarity to the dataset molecule with a value of 272.388, and considering the presence of a ketone and hydroxyl group, I predict the molar mass of **CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O** to be in a similar range. The structure appears to be a derivative of androst

Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being predicted is the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the molecules, as the values given correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the compounds listed (in g/mol). For example:

- COc1ccc(C=O)cc1 (anisaldehyde) has a molecular weight of approximately 136.15 g/mol.
- CC(C)C(C)O (3-methyl-2-butanol) has a molecular weight of approximately 88.15 g/mol.
- O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (nitrobenzene) has a molecular weight of approximately 123.11 g/mol.

Thus, I will predict the molecular weight of the target molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O using my knowledge of molecular structures and atomic weights.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES string
The SMILES string CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O represents a molecule. Let's break it down:
- CC(=O) indicates an acetyl group (CH3C=O).
- N indicates a nitrogen atom connected to the acetyl group, forming an amide bond.
- c1ccc(cc1) represents a benzene ring (c1 to c6, with c1 connected back to c6).
- The N is connected to one of the carbons in the benzene ring.
- N(=O)=O indicates a nitro group (-NO2) attached to another carbon in the benzene ring.
- Specifically, the nitro group is on the carbon para to the amide group (since it's cc1ccc(cc1), indicating positions 1 and 4 on the benzene ring).

Thus, the molecule is 4-nitroacetanilide, with the structure:
- A benzene ring substituted at position 1 with an acetamido group (-NHCOCH3) and at position 4 with a nitro group (-NO2).

### Step 2: Calculate the molecular formula
Let's determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:
- Benzene ring: C6H6, but two hydrogens are replaced by substituents.
- Acetamido group (-NHCOCH3): Adds N, C (from carbonyl), O, C (from methyl), and 3H (from methyl), plus 1H on nitrogen, but since it replaces one H on benzene, it's effectively NH (1N, 1H), CO (1C, 1O), CH3 (1C, 3H).
- Nitro group (-NO2): Adds N, 2O, replacing one H on benzene.
- Total for benzene after substitution: C6H4 (since two H are replaced).
- Total atoms:
  - Carbon: 6 (benzene) + 2 (from acetyl group) = 8C
  - Hydrogen: 4 (benzene) + 3 (methyl) + 1 (NH) = 8H
  - Nitrogen: 1 (amide) + 1 (nitro) = 2N
  - Oxygen: 1 (carbonyl) + 2 (nitro) = 3O

So, the molecular formula is C8H8N2O3.

### Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight
Using approximate atomic weights:
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol

Now, calculate:
- 8C: 8 × 12.01 = 96.08
- 8H: 8 × 1.008 = 8.064
- 2N: 2 × 14.01 = 28.02
- 3O: 3 × 16.00 = 48.00

Total molecular weight = 96.08 + 8.064 + 28.02 + 48.00 = 180.164 g/mol

### Step 4: Verify with similar compounds
Looking at the provided data, molecules with similar functional groups have molecular weights close to their calculated values:
- O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (nitrobenzene, C6H5NO2) = 123.11 g/mol (calculated: ~123.11)
- COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (methoxynitrobenzene, C7H7NO3) = 153.137 g/mol (calculated: ~153.14)

My calculation for C8H8N2O3 (180.164 g/mol) seems reasonable, as it includes an additional acetyl group compared to nitrobenzene derivatives.

### Final Prediction
The predicted property (molecular weight) for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is approximately **180.

Iteration: 18
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 367.8160000000001
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I will predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12. Since the property values in the examples are numerical and appear to correlate with molecular complexity (likely molecular weight or a related property), I will assume the property is molecular weight (in g/mol) or something closely related, as the values are consistent with typical molecular weights of organic compounds.

### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule
The SMILES string for the target molecule is CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12. Let's break it down to understand its structure and estimate its molecular weight by identifying the atoms and functional groups present.

- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)**: This part represents a thiophosphate group. Breaking it down:
  - "CCO" and "(OCC)" indicate two ethoxy groups (C2H5O-), each contributing 2 carbons, 5 hydrogens, and 1 oxygen.
  - "P(=S)" indicates a phosphorus atom double-bonded to sulfur.
  - So, this part is (C2H5O)2P(=S)-, contributing: 2C × 2 = 4C, 5H × 2 = 10H, 2O, 1P, 1S.
- **S**: A sulfur atom linking the thiophosphate to the rest of the molecule.
- **Cn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**: This represents a heterocyclic ring system, likely an oxazolidinone or isoxazoline-like structure fused to a benzene ring with a chlorine substituent.
  - "c2cc(Cl)ccc12" indicates a benzene ring (6 carbons) with a chlorine atom.
  - "Cn1c(=O)o" suggests a five-membered ring with nitrogen, oxygen, and a carbonyl group (C=O).
  - Interpreting the ring system, it is likely a benzoxazolinone or similar structure, where "n1" and "o" form part of a heterocyclic ring fused to the benzene.
  - Atom count for this part: Benzene ring (6C), plus the heterocyclic part likely adds 1C (from carbonyl), 1N, 1O, and hydrogens based on valency. Chlorine (Cl) is explicitly mentioned. Total for benzene + Cl: 6C, 1Cl, and hydrogens (likely 4H since two positions are substituted by the fused ring). Heterocycle: 1C (carbonyl), 1N, 1O, and likely 1H on nitrogen if not substituted.

### Step 2: Estimate Molecular Formula
Combining the parts:
- Thiophosphate part: 4C, 10H, 2O, 1P, 1S
- Linking sulfur: 1S
- Heterocyclic + benzene part: 7C (6 from benzene + 1 from carbonyl), 5H (4 on benzene + possibly 1 on N, adjusting for substitution), 1O (from heterocycle), 1N, 1Cl

Total estimated molecular formula:
- Carbon: 4 (thiophosphate) + 7 (heterocycle/benzene) = 11C
- Hydrogen: 10 (thiophosphate) + 5 (heterocycle/benzene) = 15H
- Oxygen: 2 (thiophosphate) + 1 (heterocycle) = 3O
- Phosphorus: 1P
- Sulfur: 1 (thiophosphate) + 1 (linking) = 2S
- Nitrogen: 1N
- Chlorine: 1Cl

So, the molecular formula is approximately C11H15O3PS2NCl.

### Step 3: Calculate Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded for simplicity):
- C: 12 × 11 = 132
- H: 1 × 15 = 15
- O: 16 × 3 = 48
- P: 31 × 1 = 31
- S: 32 × 2 = 64
- N: 14 × 1 = 14
- Cl: 35.5 × 1 = 35.5

Total molecular weight = 132 + 15 + 48 + 31 + 64 + 14 + 35.5 = 339.5 g/mol

### Step 4: Compare with Training Data
Looking at the provided examples, the property values range from around 41 to 414, and for molecules with similar complexity (e.g., multiple heteroatoms, halogens, and ring systems), the values are often in

Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 88.14999999999999
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am tasked with predicting a property for the molecule CC(C)(C)CO, which is tert-butanol (or 2-methyl-2-propanol), with the molecular formula C5H12O. The property values listed alongside the example molecules appear to correspond to molecular weights (in g/mol), as they closely match the calculated molecular weights of the given compounds. For instance:

- CCC (propane, C3H8) has a value of 44.097, which matches its molecular weight (3*12.01 + 8*1.008 = 44.094 g/mol).
- CC(C)CO (isopentanol, C5H12O) has a value of 74.123, which is close to its molecular weight (5*12.01 + 12*1.008 + 16.00 = 88.15 g/mol), though there seems to be a discrepancy here (likely a typo or error in my initial assumption for this specific entry).
- Upon rechecking, CC(C)CO is actually 2-methyl-1-butanol or a similar isomer, but let's focus on the general trend. Most values align with molecular weights.

After a closer inspection, I notice that for CC(C)CO, the value 74.123 seems incorrect for C5H12O (should be ~88.15). This suggests a possible error in my initial assumption or in the data provided. However, for most other molecules, the property values are very close to their molecular weights (e.g., O2 for O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23 is likely a typo or SMILES parsing issue, but the value 254.289 is close to a reasonable molecular weight for a complex molecule).

Given the majority of the data points align with molecular weight, I will assume the property being predicted is the molecular weight (in g/mol).

Now, let's calculate the molecular weight for CC(C)(C)CO, which is tert-butanol (C5H12O):
- Carbon (C): 5 atoms * 12.01 g/mol = 60.05 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 12 atoms * 1.008 g/mol = 12.096 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 1 atom * 16.00 g/mol = 16.00 g/mol
- Total molecular weight = 60.05 + 12.096 + 16.00 = 88.146 g/mol

However, looking at the provided data, I see that for similar alcohols, the values are sometimes lower than expected (e.g., CC(C)CO is listed as 74.123, which is less than the expected 88.15 for C5H12O). This discrepancy suggests I might have misidentified the molecule or there could be an error in the data. CC(C)CO is actually C5H12O (2-methyl-1-butanol or similar), but the value 74.123 is closer to C4H10O (butanol, molecular weight 74.12). This indicates a possible typo in the SMILES or data.

To resolve this, I note that CC(C)(C)CO is tert-butanol, which is also C5H12O, and should have a molecular weight of 88.15 g/mol. Looking at similar molecules in the list:
- CCCC(O)CCC (C7H16O) has a value of 116.204 (close to 116.20 g/mol)
- CCCCC(CC)CO (C8H18O) has a value of 130.231 (close to 130.23 g/mol)
- CC(C)CO is listed as 74.123, which seems to match C4H10O (butanol, 74.12 g/mol), suggesting a possible mislabeling.

Given the confusion, I will stick to calculating the molecular weight for CC(C)(C)CO as C5H12O. The correct molecular formula for CC(C)(C)CO is indeed C5H12O (tert-butanol), but I suspect the data might be inconsistent. However, since most values align with molecular weights, I will predict based on that.

I also consider if the property might be something else, like boiling point or melting point, but the values (e.g., 44.097 for propane, 167.85 for CCl4) don't consistently match typical boiling or melting points. For instance, propane's boiling point is -42°C, not 44.097, and CCl4's boiling point is 76.7°C, not 167.85. Thus, molecular weight remains the most plausible property.

Therefore, for CC(C)(C)CO (tert-butanol, C5H12

Iteration: 20
SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 136.114
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am tasked with predicting a property for the molecule with the SMILES notation `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12`. The property values in the examples appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they are consistent with the calculated molecular weights for many of the given molecules. For instance, benzene (`c1ccccc1`) is not listed directly, but related compounds like `Nc1ccccc1` (aniline) have a value of 93.129, which matches its molecular weight (C6H7N = 93.13 g/mol). Similarly, other examples like `CCCCCl` (92.569, close to C5H11Cl = 92.57 g/mol) support this interpretation. Therefore, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight of the molecule.

Now, let's analyze the given molecule `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12`. This SMILES string represents a heterocyclic compound, likely a purine derivative or a similar structure with fused rings containing nitrogen atoms and a carbonyl group. To predict the molecular weight, I will first deduce the molecular formula by interpreting the SMILES notation.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES string `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12`
- `O=c1`: Indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) where the carbon is part of a ring (denoted by the number 1).
- `[nH]`: A nitrogen atom with an explicit hydrogen, part of the ring.
- `cnc`: A sequence of carbon, nitrogen, carbon atoms in the ring.
- `2`: Indicates the start of a second ring or a connection to another part of the structure.
- `nc[nH]c12`: Additional nitrogen and carbon atoms, with another `[nH]` indicating a nitrogen with a hydrogen, and the numbers `1` and `2` indicating ring closures.

This SMILES represents a bicyclic structure with nitrogen atoms, likely xanthine or a similar purine derivative. Let's count the atoms:
- The structure suggests a purine-like skeleton (a fused imidazole and pyrimidine ring).
- Purine itself is C5H4N4, but with modifications like carbonyl groups and additional hydrogens on nitrogens as indicated by `[nH]`.

Breaking it down:
- The SMILES `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` suggests a structure with a carbonyl (O=) attached to a carbon in the ring.
- Counting the atoms from the SMILES:
  - Carbons: There are likely 5 carbons in a purine-like structure (based on standard purine numbering).
  - Nitrogens: There are 4 nitrogens (two with explicit H as `[nH]`, and two without).
  - Oxygens: 1 oxygen from the carbonyl (`O=`).
  - Hydrogens: Two explicit hydrogens on nitrogens (`[nH]`), and possibly others depending on the structure.

This SMILES corresponds to xanthine, a purine derivative with two carbonyl groups. However, the SMILES shows only one `O=`, which might indicate a specific tautomer or a related compound like hypoxanthine (C5H4N4O), which has one carbonyl group.

Upon closer inspection, the SMILES `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` is likely hypoxanthine, with the molecular formula C5H4N4O:
- 5 carbons.
- 4 nitrogens.
- 1 oxygen.
- 4 hydrogens (two on nitrogens as indicated by `[nH]`, and the rest implied by valency).

### Step 2: Calculate the molecular weight
Using standard atomic weights (approximate values for simplicity, as I am not using external tools):
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol

Molecular formula: C5H4N4O
- Carbon: 5 × 12.01 = 60.05
- Hydrogen: 4 × 1.008 = 4.032
- Nitrogen: 4 × 14.01 = 56.04
- Oxygen: 1 × 16.00 = 16.00

Total molecular weight = 60.05 + 4.032 + 56.04 + 16.00 = 136.122 g/mol

### Step 3: Compare with similar molecules in the dataset
Looking at the provided dataset, a similar molecule is `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F`
==================================================
Iteration: 21
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 88.106
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**. The property values in the dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they are consistent with the calculated molecular weights of the given molecules when considering their structural formulas. For instance, CCCCCCO (heptanol) has a value of 116.204, which matches its molecular weight (C7H16O = 116.20 g/mol), and CC(C)O (isopropanol) has a value of 60.096, matching its molecular weight (C3H8O = 60.10 g/mol). Therefore, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight.

The molecule **CC(C)OC=O** can be interpreted as isopropyl formate, with the structure (CH3)2CH-O-C=O, where "CC(C)" represents the isopropyl group (CH3-CH-CH3) and "OC=O" represents the formate group (-O-CHO). Let's calculate its molecular formula and molecular weight:

- **Carbon atoms**: 
  - From isopropyl (CC(C)): 3 carbons
  - From formate (OC=O): 1 carbon
  - Total: 4 carbons
- **Hydrogen atoms**: 
  - From isopropyl: 7 hydrogens (as in (CH3)2CH-, where the central carbon has 1 H)
  - From formate: 1 hydrogen (in -CHO)
  - Total: 8 hydrogens
- **Oxygen atoms**: 
  - From formate: 2 oxygens (one in the carbonyl C=O and one in the ester linkage -O-)
  - Total: 2 oxygens

Thus, the molecular formula is **C4H8O2**.

Now, calculate the molecular weight:
- Carbon: 4 × 12.011 = 48.044 g/mol
- Hydrogen: 8 × 1.008 = 8.064 g/mol
- Oxygen: 2 × 15.999 = 31.998 g/mol
- Total: 48.044 + 8.064 + 31.998 = **88.106 g/mol**

To confirm the interpretation, I note that the structure CC(C)OC=O is less common in SMILES notation (where formate might be written as O=CO), but based on the context and pattern of the dataset, it is reasonable to interpret it as isopropyl formate (C4H8O2). Comparing with similar molecules in the dataset:
- CC(C)O (isopropanol, C3H8O) has a molecular weight of 60.096.
- CCOCC (diethyl ether, C4H10O) is not in the list but would be around 74.12, showing that adding carbons and oxygens increases the weight predictably.

Given the molecular formula C4H8O2, the calculated value of 88.106 is consistent with expected molecular weights in the dataset (rounded to three decimal places, as seen in most entries like 60.096, 116.204, etc.).

Therefore, my predicted property value (molecular weight) for **CC(C)OC=O** is **88.106**.

**Final Answer: 88.106**

Iteration: 22
SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 212.252
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, which is urea with two phenyl substituents, commonly known as diphenylurea. The property in question appears to be molecular weight (or molar mass) in g/mol, as the values in the dataset correspond closely to the molecular weights of the given compounds. For instance, C1CCCCC1 (cyclohexane) has a value of 84.162, which matches its molecular weight, and OCC(O)CO (glycerol) has a value of 92.094, also matching its molecular weight.

To predict the property for O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, I will calculate its molecular weight based on its chemical formula. Let's break down the structure:

- The molecule is diphenylurea, with the formula C6H5-NH-C(O)-NH-C6H5.
- Carbon atoms: 12 (6 from each phenyl ring) + 1 (from the carbonyl group) = 13
- Hydrogen atoms: 5 from each phenyl ring (10 total) + 2 from the NH groups = 12
- Nitrogen atoms: 2 (one in each NH group)
- Oxygen atoms: 1 (from the carbonyl group)

Thus, the molecular formula is C13H12N2O.

Now, calculating the molecular weight using approximate atomic masses (C = 12, H = 1, N = 14, O = 16):
- Carbon: 13 × 12 = 156
- Hydrogen: 12 × 1 = 12
- Nitrogen: 2 × 14 = 28
- Oxygen: 1 × 16 = 16
- Total = 156 + 12 + 28 + 16 = 212

This gives an approximate molecular weight of 212 g/mol. To refine this, I note that the dataset values are precise (e.g., cyclohexane is 84.162, not 84), suggesting the use of standard atomic weights (C = 12.011, H = 1.008, N = 14.007, O = 15.999). However, since I'm relying on memory and the values in the dataset are consistent with rounded or approximate calculations in some cases, I'll compare with similar molecules.

Looking at the dataset for molecules with similar structures:
- CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (acetanilide with a bromine substituent) has a value of 214.062, close to its molecular weight.
- Molecules with two aromatic rings, like Cc1cccc2ccccc12 (naphthalene derivative), have a value of 142.201, and c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3 (quinoline derivative) has 179.222.

Given that diphenylurea has two phenyl rings connected by a urea bridge, its molecular weight should be higher than single-ring compounds but comparable to other two-ring systems, adjusted for the urea moiety. A precise calculation (using standard atomic weights) would be:
- C: 13 × 12.011 = 156.143
- H: 12 × 1.008 = 12.096
- N: 2 × 14.007 = 28.014
- O: 1 × 15.999 = 15.999
- Total = 156.143 + 12.096 + 28.014 + 15.999 ≈ 212.252

Thus, the molecular weight is approximately 212.25 g/mol. Since the dataset values are often rounded to three decimal places, and considering the pattern, I predict the property value for O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 to be close to this calculated molecular weight.

**Predicted Property Value: 212.252**

This prediction aligns with the molecular weight calculation and the pattern observed in the provided dataset. If the property were something else (e.g., boiling point or another physical property), the dataset values would not match molecular weights so closely, confirming my assumption.

Iteration: 23
SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 166.22299999999998
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being described for each molecule is the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) in grams per mole (g/mol). This is inferred from the values given, which align closely with the calculated molecular weights of the molecules based on their SMILES strings. For example:

- For "CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1" (acetanilide), the given value is 135.166, which matches the molecular weight of C8H9NO (8*12.01 + 9*1.008 + 14.01 + 16.00 = 135.16 g/mol).
- For "COC(=O)C" (methyl formate), the value is 74.079, which matches C3H6O2 (3*12.01 + 6*1.008 + 2*16.00 = 74.08 g/mol).

Thus, the task is to predict the molecular weight of the molecule represented by the SMILES string "C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13".

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string "C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13" represents a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. Let's break it down:
- "C1" indicates a carbon atom that is part of a ring (ring closure label 1).
- "c2ccccc2" represents a benzene ring (six carbon atoms in a ring, with ring closure label 2).
- "c3ccccc13" represents another benzene ring fused to the structure, with ring closure labels 3 and 1, indicating fusion points.

This structure corresponds to **anthracene**, a tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with three fused benzene rings in a linear arrangement. The molecular formula of anthracene is C14H10.

### Step 2: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using the atomic masses (approximated to standard values):
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol

For C14H10:
- Mass from carbon = 14 * 12.01 = 168.14 g/mol
- Mass from hydrogen = 10 * 1.008 = 10.08 g/mol
- Total molecular weight = 168.14 + 10.08 = 178.22 g/mol

### Step 3: Cross-Check with Similar Molecules
Looking at the provided data, a similar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is "c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1", which corresponds to **pyrene** (C16H10) with a given value of 228.294 g/mol. Calculating pyrene's molecular weight:
- C16 * 12.01 = 192.16
- H10 * 1.008 = 10.08
- Total = 202.24 g/mol (Note: There seems to be a discrepancy in the provided data for pyrene, as 228.294 does not match the expected 202.24. This might be a typo or error in the dataset, but I will proceed with my calculation for anthracene.)

Since anthracene (C14H10) has fewer carbon atoms than pyrene, its molecular weight should be lower, which aligns with my calculation of 178.22 g/mol.

### Final Prediction
Based on the molecular formula of anthracene (C14H10) derived from the SMILES string "C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13", the predicted molecular weight is approximately **178.22 g/mol**.

**Predicted Property Value: 178.22**

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 214.25
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1. From the context of the examples, it appears that the property being measured is likely the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the given SMILES strings.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 represents a molecule with the following structural features:
- A guanidine-like group: NC(=N)N, where a nitrogen is double-bonded to a carbon, and another nitrogen is attached.
- A sulfonamide group: NS(=O)(=O), indicating a sulfur atom double-bonded to two oxygens and single-bonded to a nitrogen.
- A benzene ring: c1ccc(N)cc1, with an amino group (N, likely NH2) attached to one of the carbons in the para position relative to the sulfonamide attachment.

This molecule can be interpreted as a para-aminobenzenesulfonamide derivative with a guanidine-like substituent on the sulfonamide nitrogen.

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
To predict the molecular weight, I will calculate the molecular formula by parsing the SMILES string:
- **Nitrogen atoms**: 
  - NC(=N)N: 3 N atoms (one from NC, one from =N, one from N).
  - NS(=O)(=O): 1 N atom.
  - c1ccc(N)cc1: 1 N atom (from the amino group on the benzene ring).
  - Total N: 5.
- **Carbon atoms**:
  - NC(=N)N: 1 C atom.
  - c1ccc(N)cc1: 6 C atoms (benzene ring).
  - Total C: 7.
- **Hydrogen atoms**:
  - NC(=N)N: The first N likely has 2 H (as NH2), the =N has no H (double bond), and the last N is connected to S, so likely no H if fully substituted (to be confirmed by valency).
  - c1ccc(N)cc1: Benzene ring has 4 H (since two positions are substituted: one by S and one by NH2), and NH2 contributes 2 H.
  - Total H (tentative): 2 (from NH2 in guanidine) + 2 (from NH2 on benzene) + 4 (from benzene) = 8 (subject to valency check).
- **Sulfur atoms**: 1 S from NS(=O)(=O).
- **Oxygen atoms**: 2 O from S(=O)(=O).

Tentative molecular formula: C7H8N5O2S. However, I will adjust H count based on valency:
- In NC(=N)N, the structure is likely NH2-C(=NH)-NH-, so the middle carbon has a double bond to one N (no H) and single bonds to two NH2 groups. Thus, it’s NH2-C(=NH)-NH-S, so H count: 2 (first NH2) + 1 (middle NH) + 0 (last NH, connected to S) = 3 H.
- Benzene ring: 4 H (two substitutions).
- Benzene NH2: 2 H.
- Total H: 3 + 4 + 2 = 9.

Corrected molecular formula: C7H9N5O2S.

### Step 3: Calculate Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (approximate values for simplicity, as exact values are not needed for prediction context):
- C: 12.01 × 7 = 84.07
- H: 1.008 × 9 = 9.072
- N: 14.01 × 5 = 70.05
- O: 16.00 × 2 = 32.00
- S: 32.06 × 1 = 32.06
- Total: 84.07 + 9.072 + 70.05 + 32.00 + 32.06 ≈ 227.25

### Step 4: Compare with Examples
Looking at the provided data, molecular weights range from small molecules like CNN (46.073) to larger ones like COC(=O)c1ccccc1OC2OC(COC3OCC(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O (446.405). My calculated value of approximately 227.25 fits within this range. Molecules with similar complexity (e.g., O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O
==================================================
Iteration: 25
SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 333.266
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being predicted is the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the molecules, as the values given correspond closely to the molecular weights of the compounds listed (in g/mol). For instance, CCN(CC)c1ccccc1 corresponds to N,N-diethylaniline with a molecular weight of approximately 149.23 g/mol, and Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl corresponds to 2,2'-dichlorobiphenyl with a molecular weight of approximately 223.10 g/mol. Therefore, I will predict the molecular weight of the given molecule: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O.

Let's break down the molecular formula of the given SMILES string step by step to calculate its molecular weight.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES string
The SMILES string is: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O

- **CCN**: This represents an ethyl group (C2H5) attached to a nitrogen atom.
- **(CC(C)=C)**: This represents a branched alkene group attached to the nitrogen, specifically a 2-methylpropene-like structure (C4H7, since it's CC(C)=C, indicating a double bond with a methyl branch).
- **c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**: This represents a benzene ring (c1...c1) with substituents:
  - Two nitro groups (N(=O)=O) at positions 1 and 6 (based on the SMILES notation).
  - A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) at position 3.
  - The nitrogen from the amine (N) is attached to the benzene ring at position 1, but since position 1 already has a nitro group, the attachment and numbering need careful interpretation. In SMILES, the first atom after the ring closure is position 1, so the nitrogen of the amine is connected to carbon 1 of the ring, and the nitro groups are on carbons 2 and 6.

Let's derive the molecular formula:
- Benzene ring: C6H6 (but hydrogens will be replaced by substituents).
- Substituents on benzene:
  - At position 1: N from the amine (replaces one H).
  - At position 2: NO2 (nitro group, replaces one H).
  - At position 3: CF3 (trifluoromethyl, replaces one H).
  - At position 6: NO2 (nitro group, replaces one H).
- So, benzene contributes C6H2 (since 4 hydrogens are replaced by substituents).
- Amine part: N connected to CC (ethyl, C2H5) and CC(C)=C (which is C4H7, as it's a 2-methylpropene-like group with a double bond).
- Total from amine: N + C2H5 + C4H7 = NC6H12.
- Nitro groups: 2 × NO2 = N2O4.
- Trifluoromethyl: CF3.

Total molecular formula:
- Carbon: 6 (benzene) + 6 (amine part) = 12
- Hydrogen: 2 (benzene) + 12 (amine part) = 14
- Nitrogen: 1 (amine) + 2 (nitro groups) = 3
- Oxygen: 4 (from two NO2 groups)
- Fluorine: 3 (from CF3)

So, the molecular formula is C12H14N3O4F3.

### Step 2: Calculate the molecular weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded to three decimal places for consistency with the provided data):
- C: 12.011 g/mol
- H: 1.008 g/mol
- N: 14.007 g/mol
- O: 15.999 g/mol
- F: 18.998 g/mol

Now calculate:
- Carbon: 12 × 12.011 = 144.132
- Hydrogen: 14 × 1.008 = 14.112
- Nitrogen: 3 × 14.007 = 42.021
- Oxygen: 4 × 15.999 = 63.996
- Fluorine: 3 × 18.998 = 56.994

Total molecular weight = 144.132 + 14.112 + 42.021 + 63.996 + 56.994 = 321.255 g/mol

### Step 3: Predict the property value
Since the property in the provided data appears to be molecular weight, I predict
==================================================
Iteration: 26
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 88.106
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I will predict the property for the molecule **CC(C)OC=O**. First, I need to interpret the nature of the property being measured for the given molecules. Examining the list of molecules and their associated values, it appears that the property is likely the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values are consistent with typical molecular weights in g/mol for organic molecules of varying complexity. For instance, benzene (c1ccccc1) has a value of 78.114, which matches its molecular weight (C6H6: 6*12.01 + 6*1.008 = 78.114 g/mol), and other molecules like ClC(Cl)Cl (trichloroethylene) at 119.378 also align with calculated molecular weights.

Now, let's analyze the target molecule **CC(C)OC=O**. This SMILES notation represents a molecule with the structure of an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. Let's break it down:
- **CC(C)** represents an isopropyl group (CH3-CH-CH3).
- **O** indicates an oxygen atom connected to the isopropyl group.
- **C=O** represents a carbonyl group, suggesting a formate ester (HCOO-).

Thus, the molecule is **HCOOCH(CH3)2**, or isopropyl formate. To predict the molecular weight, I will calculate it based on the atomic composition:
- Carbon (C): 4 atoms (3 from isopropyl + 1 from formate)
- Hydrogen (H): 8 atoms (6 from isopropyl + 2 from formate)
- Oxygen (O): 2 atoms (1 from the ester linkage + 1 from the carbonyl)

Using standard atomic weights:
- C: 12.01 g/mol
- H: 1.008 g/mol
- O: 16.00 g/mol

Molecular weight = (4 * 12.01) + (8 * 1.008) + (2 * 16.00)
= 48.04 + 8.064 + 32.00
= 88.104 g/mol

To validate this prediction, I can compare it with similar molecules in the provided dataset. For instance:
- **CC(C)CCOC=O** (likely a formate ester with a longer chain) has a value of 116.16 g/mol. This molecule has more carbons and hydrogens, so a higher molecular weight is expected.
- **CCC(C)(C)O** (tert-pentanol) and **CCC(O)CC** (2-pentanol) both have values of 88.15 g/mol, which is very close to my calculated value for isopropyl formate (88.104 g/mol). These molecules also have similar numbers of atoms (C5H12O vs. C4H8O2), and the slight difference can be attributed to the difference in oxygen content versus carbon/hydrogen.

Given the consistency of my calculation with the trend in the dataset, I predict the property value (molecular weight) for **CC(C)OC=O** to be approximately **88.10 g/mol**. Rounding to three decimal places as seen in most of the provided data, my final predicted value is:

**Predicted Property Value: 88.104**
==================================================
Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 122.16699999999996
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being described for each molecule is the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) in g/mol. This conclusion is drawn from the consistent correlation between the molecular formulas (represented as SMILES strings) and the numerical values, which match the expected molecular weights of the compounds when calculated manually for several examples. For instance:

- CO (methanol) has a value of 32.042, which matches its molecular weight (C: 12.01, O: 16.00, H: 1.008 × 2 = 32.042 g/mol).
- CC(C)C (isobutane) has a value of 58.124, which matches its molecular weight (C: 12.01 × 4, H: 1.008 × 10 = 58.124 g/mol).
- c1ccccc1O (phenol) has a value of 94.113, which matches its molecular weight (C: 12.01 × 6, H: 1.008 × 6, O: 16.00 = 94.113 g/mol).

Thus, the task is to predict the molecular weight of the given molecule, Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, based on its SMILES notation.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 represents a benzene ring (c1...c1 indicates a cyclic structure with aromatic carbons) with substituents. Let's break it down:
- "c1" to "c1" indicates a six-membered aromatic ring (benzene).
- "C" before "c1" indicates a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to the first carbon of the ring.
- "c(C)" indicates another methyl group (-CH₃) attached to the third carbon of the ring.
- "c(O)" indicates a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the fifth carbon of the ring.

Thus, the molecule is a benzene ring with two methyl groups (at positions 1 and 3) and one hydroxyl group (at position 5). This corresponds to **2,4-dimethylphenol** or a similar isomer, but the exact positions are determined by the SMILES order. For molecular weight, the exact positions do not matter—only the total number of atoms does.

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
From the SMILES string:
- The benzene ring (c1ccccc1) contributes 6 carbon atoms (C₆) and, implicitly, 6 hydrogen atoms in an unsubstituted benzene. However, since it's substituted, we adjust the hydrogens based on the substituents.
- In SMILES, "c" in a ring denotes an aromatic carbon, and hydrogens are implied to satisfy valency. For a benzene ring, each "c" has one hydrogen unless substituted.
- Substituents:
  - First "C" (methyl group): Adds 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens (CH₃), replacing one hydrogen on the ring.
  - Second "C" (methyl group in parentheses): Adds another 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens (CH₃), replacing another hydrogen on the ring.
  - "O" (hydroxyl group): Adds 1 oxygen and 1 hydrogen (OH), replacing another hydrogen on the ring.

Counting the atoms:
- **Carbons**: 6 (from benzene) + 1 (first methyl) + 1 (second methyl) = 8 carbons.
- **Hydrogens**: In unsubstituted benzene, there are 6 hydrogens. Three are replaced by substituents (2 methyls and 1 hydroxyl). So, remaining hydrogens on the ring = 6 - 3 = 3. Additional hydrogens from substituents: 3 (first methyl) + 3 (second methyl) + 1 (hydroxyl) = 7. Total hydrogens = 3 (ring) + 7 (substituents) = 10.
- **Oxygens**: 1 (from hydroxyl group).

Thus, the molecular formula is C₈H₁₀O.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (approximate values for simplicity, as the provided data seems to use rounded values):
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol

Molecular weight = (8 × 12.01) + (10 × 1.008) + (1 × 16.00)
= 96.08 + 10.08 + 16.00
= 122.16 g/mol

### Step 4: Cross-Check with Similar Molecules
To ensure accuracy, let's compare with similar molecules from the provided list:
- c1
==================================================
Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 278.335
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**. The property in question appears to be related to molecular weight or a similar physicochemical property, given the numerical values and their correlation with molecular complexity in the examples. I will assume it is the molecular weight (in g/mol) for this prediction, as the values closely match typical molecular weights of organic compounds.

### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule
The SMILES string **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** represents a molecule with the following structural features:
- A thiophosphate group: **COP(=S)(OC)O-**, which includes a phosphorus atom double-bonded to sulfur, and connected to two methoxy groups (**-OCH3**) and one oxygen that links to an aromatic ring.
- An aromatic benzene ring substituted with:
  - An oxygen atom (from the thiophosphate linkage),
  - A thiomethyl group (**-SCH3**) at the para position relative to the oxygen,
  - A methyl group (**-CH3**) at the ortho or meta position (likely ortho based on SMILES notation).

This molecule resembles organophosphorus pesticides or related compounds, similar to some of the examples provided (e.g., **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl** with a value of 366.0).

### Step 2: Compare with Similar Molecules in the Dataset
To predict the property, I will compare the target molecule to structurally similar molecules in the provided list, focusing on those with thiophosphate groups and substituted benzene rings. Relevant examples include:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl**: Property value = 366.0
  - Substituents on benzene: Two Cl and one Br.
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl**: Property value = 413.0
  - Substituents on benzene: Two Cl and one I.
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property value = 321.549
  - Substituents on benzene: Three Cl.

The target molecule has substituents **-SCH3** and **-CH3** instead of halogens. I will estimate the property value by considering the differences in atomic contributions (assuming the property is molecular weight).

### Step 3: Estimate Molecular Weight
Let’s calculate the approximate molecular weight of the target molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** by breaking it down into its components:
- **Core thiophosphate group: COP(=S)(OC)O-**
  - C (from two -OCH3): 2 × 12 = 24
  - O (two from -OCH3, one linking to ring): 3 × 16 = 48
  - P: 1 × 31 = 31
  - S (double-bonded to P): 1 × 32 = 32
  - H (six from two -OCH3): 6 × 1 = 6
  - Subtotal: 24 + 48 + 31 + 32 + 6 = 141
- **Benzene ring: C6H4-** (since two positions are substituted)
  - C: 6 × 12 = 72
  - H: 4 × 1 = 4
  - Subtotal: 72 + 4 = 76
- **Substituents on benzene:**
  - **-SCH3**: S (32) + C (12) + H3 (3) = 47
  - **-CH3**: C (12) + H3 (3) = 15
  - Subtotal: 47 + 15 = 62
- **Total estimated molecular weight**: 141 (thiophosphate) + 76 (benzene) + 62 (substituents) = 279

### Step 4: Adjust Based on Dataset Trends
The calculated molecular weight of 279 g/mol is a rough estimate. Comparing with similar molecules:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** (three Cl atoms, MW ~321.5) has a higher value due to heavier chlorine atoms (Cl = 35.5 each, total 3 × 35.5 = 106.5 for Cl atoms).
- Replacing Cl with lighter groups like -SCH3 (47) and -CH3 (15) should reduce the value significantly, which aligns with my estimate of 279.

However, let’s refine this by considering the exact molecular formula of **COP(=S)(
==================================================
Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 326.437
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**. The property values in the dataset appear to correlate with molecular weight or a related property, as they generally increase with the size and complexity of the molecule, particularly with the presence of heavier atoms like chlorine (Cl).

### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule
The SMILES string **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** represents a biphenyl-like structure with multiple chlorine substitutions. Let's break it down:
- It consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond (biphenyl core).
- The first ring has chlorine atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 (assuming standard numbering from the SMILES notation).
- The second ring has chlorine atoms at positions 2' and 6' (or equivalent positions based on SMILES parsing).
- Total chlorine atoms: 5.

This is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with a molecular formula of C12H5Cl5.

### Step 2: Estimate Molecular Weight
Since the property values in the dataset seem to closely resemble molecular weights (e.g., CC with 30.07 matches ethane's molecular weight, CN(=O)=O with 61.04 matches nitromethane's molecular weight), I will calculate the approximate molecular weight of the target molecule as a basis for prediction:
- Carbon (C): 12 atoms × 12.01 = 144.12
- Hydrogen (H): 5 atoms × 1.008 = 5.04
- Chlorine (Cl): 5 atoms × 35.45 = 177.25
- Total molecular weight ≈ 144.12 + 5.04 + 177.25 = 326.41 g/mol

### Step 3: Compare with Similar Molecules in the Dataset
Looking at the dataset, there are several molecules with chlorine atoms and biphenyl-like structures:
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (C12H4Cl6, property value 360.882): This is a hexachlorobiphenyl with a molecular weight of approximately 360.88 g/mol (12*12.01 + 4*1.008 + 6*35.45 = 360.88), matching the property value.
- **Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl** (C12H3Cl7, property value 395.327): This is a heptachlorobiphenyl with a molecular weight of approximately 395.33 g/mol, again matching the property value.

My target molecule has 5 chlorine atoms (C12H5Cl5), so its molecular weight (326.41 g/mol) should be between the tetrachlorobiphenyls and hexachlorobiphenyls. The property value should be close to the molecular weight, following the trend.

### Step 4: Predict the Property Value
Given that the property values in the dataset consistently match the molecular weights of the molecules (with minor deviations likely due to rounding or isotopic averages), I predict that the property value for **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** is approximately equal to its molecular weight.

Thus, the predicted property value is **326.41**.

### Final Answer
**326.41**
==================================================
Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 89.09399999999998
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am tasked with predicting a property for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, which is nitropropane (C3H7NO2), using the patterns observed in the given examples. The property values listed alongside the molecules appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) in g/mol, as the values match closely with the calculated molecular weights of the compounds when rounded appropriately. For instance:

- CC (ethane, C2H6) has a value of 30.07, which matches its molecular weight.
- CCC (propane, C3H8) has a value of 44.097, close to its molecular weight of 44.10.
- C1CCCCC1 (cyclohexane, C6H12) has a value of 84.162, close to 84.16.
- CCCC (butane, C4H10) is not listed directly, but similar alkanes follow the trend.

Given this observation, I hypothesize that the property being predicted is the molecular weight of the molecule.

Now, let's calculate the molecular weight of CCCN(=O)=O (nitropropane, C3H7NO2):

- Carbon (C): 3 atoms × 12.01 g/mol = 36.03 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 7 atoms × 1.008 g/mol = 7.056 g/mol
- Nitrogen (N): 1 atom × 14.01 g/mol = 14.01 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 2 atoms × 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 36.03 + 7.056 + 14.01 + 32.00 = 89.096 g/mol

Rounding to three decimal places (as most values in the dataset are presented), the predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O is approximately **89.096**.

To further validate, I note that nitro-containing compounds in the dataset, such as O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (trinitrobenzene) with a value of 213.105, align with their expected molecular weights (calculated as 213.09 g/mol). Similarly, CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a value of 335.282, consistent with its structure's molecular weight. This supports the idea that the property is molecular weight.

Thus, my predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O is **89.096**.
==================================================
Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 175.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I will predict the property value for the molecule **Fc1cccc(Br)c1**, which represents 1-bromo-2-fluorobenzene (a benzene ring substituted with bromine and fluorine at adjacent positions). The property values in the dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (in g/mol), as they align closely with the calculated molar masses of the given molecules. For instance, Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (1-bromo-4-chlorobenzene) has a value of 191.455, which matches its approximate molecular weight (C6H4BrCl: 6*12 + 4*1 + 79.9 + 35.5 ≈ 191.4). Similarly, NC(=O)N (urea) has a value of 60.056, matching its molecular weight (CH4N2O: 12 + 4*1 + 2*14 + 16 ≈ 60.06). Thus, I will assume the property is molecular weight and predict accordingly.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** describes a benzene ring (c1cccc1) with a fluorine (F) and a bromine (Br) substituent. The notation indicates that F is attached to the first carbon and Br to the second carbon in the ring, making it 1-bromo-2-fluorobenzene (ortho-substituted).

### Step 2: Calculate the Molecular Formula
- Benzene ring: C6H6
- Replace two hydrogens with F and Br: C6H4FBr
- Atomic composition:
  - Carbon (C): 6
  - Hydrogen (H): 4
  - Fluorine (F): 1
  - Bromine (Br): 1

### Step 3: Estimate the Molecular Weight
Using approximate atomic weights:
- C: 12.01 g/mol
- H: 1.008 g/mol
- F: 19.00 g/mol
- Br: 79.90 g/mol

Molecular weight = (6 * 12.01) + (4 * 1.008) + (1 * 19.00) + (1 * 79.90)
= 72.06 + 4.032 + 19.00 + 79.90
= 174.992 g/mol

### Step 4: Compare with Similar Molecules in the Dataset
To refine the prediction, I’ll look at molecules with similar structures (halogen-substituted benzenes) in the provided data:
- **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** (1-bromo-4-chlorobenzene, C6H4BrCl): 191.455
  - Molecular weight: 6*12 + 4*1 + 79.9 + 35.5 ≈ 191.4 (matches)
- **COc1cccc(Cl)c1** (1-chloro-3-methoxybenzene, C7H7ClO): 142.585
  - Molecular weight: 7*12 + 7*1 + 35.5 + 16 ≈ 142.5 (matches)
- **COc1ccccc1Cl** (1-chloro-2-methoxybenzene, C7H7ClO): 142.585 (same as above)

For **C6H4BrCl**, replacing Cl (35.5) with F (19.0) should decrease the molecular weight by approximately 16.5 g/mol:
- 191.455 - 16.5 ≈ 175.0 g/mol

This aligns closely with my calculated value of 174.992 g/mol for C6H4BrF.

### Step 5: Final Prediction
Given the consistency between my calculation and the adjustment based on similar molecules, I predict the property value (molecular weight) for **Fc1cccc(Br)c1** to be approximately **174.99**.

However, to match the precision typically seen in the dataset (three decimal places), I will round it accordingly. My calculated value is 174.992, but considering the dataset’s values are often slightly adjusted (likely due to exact isotopic masses), I will predict:

**Predicted Property Value: 174.992**

This value is based on direct calculation and corroborated by comparison with similar halogenated benzene derivatives in the provided data. If the property were something other than molecular weight, the prediction approach would differ, but the data strongly suggests molecular weight as the property in question.

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 154.253
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I can infer that the property being described is likely the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) of the compounds, given the values and their correlation with the molecular formulas. Molecular weight is a fundamental property in chemistry, calculated as the sum of the atomic weights of all atoms in a molecule, typically expressed in g/mol or Dalton (Da). The values in the dataset match closely with the expected molecular weights of the given molecules, confirming this assumption.

Now, let's predict the molecular weight for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**. This is a SMILES notation representing a bicyclic or polycyclic compound with specific substituents. Let's break down the structure to estimate its molecular formula and calculate the molecular weight.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** describes a molecule with a cyclic structure. Here's the interpretation:
- **C1** and **C2** indicate ring closures, suggesting a bicyclic structure.
- **CC1(C)** indicates a carbon (C1) with two methyl groups (C) attached, forming a gem-dimethyl group on a ring carbon.
- **C2CCC1** describes a cyclohexane-like ring involving C1 and C2 with additional carbons.
- **(C)C(O)C2** indicates another methyl group and a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to carbons in the second ring closure.

After parsing, this SMILES likely represents a molecule similar to a norbornane or pinane derivative, with two rings sharing carbons, multiple methyl substituents, and a hydroxyl group. A reasonable molecular formula can be derived by counting the atoms:
- Carbons: From the SMILES, there are likely 10 carbon atoms (based on the bicyclic structure and methyl groups).
- Hydrogens: Estimating based on the degree of unsaturation in a bicyclic structure and substituents, there are likely 18 hydrogens.
- Oxygen: One oxygen from the hydroxyl group (-OH).

Thus, the molecular formula is approximately **C10H18O**.

### Step 2: Calculate Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded for simplicity):
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol

Molecular weight of **C10H18O**:
- Carbon: 10 × 12.01 = 120.1
- Hydrogen: 18 × 1.008 = 18.144
- Oxygen: 1 × 16.00 = 16.0

Total = 120.1 + 18.144 + 16.0 = **154.244 g/mol**

### Step 3: Cross-Check with Dataset Patterns
Looking at the provided dataset, molecules with similar carbon counts and functional groups have comparable molecular weights:
- **CCCC(C)(C)O** (C6H14O) = 102.177 (close to calculated 102.17)
- **CCCOCCC** (C7H14O) = 102.177 (matches C7H14O)
- **CC(C)(C)CO** (C5H12O) = 88.15 (matches calculated 88.15)

My calculated value of 154.244 for **C10H18O** fits the trend for a molecule with 10 carbons and one oxygen. For instance, **CCCCCCCCCC(C)O** (C11H24O) = 172.312, which is slightly higher as expected due to more carbons.

### Final Prediction
Based on the molecular formula **C10H18O** and the calculated molecular weight, I predict the property value (molecular weight) for the molecule **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2** to be approximately **154.24**.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 299.28800000000007
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being described for each molecule is the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) in g/mol. This conclusion is drawn from the consistent correlation between the molecular structures (given in SMILES notation) and the numerical values, which align with typical molecular weights for organic compounds of similar complexity.

Now, let's predict the molecular weight for the target molecule: **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**.

### Step-by-Step Analysis of the Molecule:
1. **Parse the SMILES String**: The SMILES notation represents a molecule with an organophosphorus group connected to a phthalimide-like structure.
   - **CCOP(=S)(OCC)**: This part indicates a thiophosphate group with two ethoxy groups (OCC) attached to a phosphorus atom, which is double-bonded to sulfur (=S).
   - **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**: This represents a phthalimide structure, where a nitrogen atom is part of a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups (C=O) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1).

2. **Break Down the Molecular Formula**:
   - **Carbon (C)**:
     - From "CCO" (two ethoxy groups): 2 × 2 = 4 carbons.
     - From the benzene ring (c1ccccc1): 6 carbons.
     - From the two carbonyls in the phthalimide: 2 carbons.
     - Total C = 4 + 6 + 2 = 12.
   - **Hydrogen (H)**:
     - From "CCO" (two ethoxy groups, each CH3-CH2-O-): 2 × 5 = 10 hydrogens.
     - From the benzene ring: 4 hydrogens (since two positions are substituted by the carbonyl carbons in phthalimide).
     - Total H = 10 + 4 = 14.
   - **Oxygen (O)**:
     - From "OCC" (two ethoxy groups): 2 oxygens.
     - From the two carbonyls (C=O): 2 oxygens.
     - Total O = 2 + 2 = 4.
   - **Nitrogen (N)**:
     - From "N2" in the phthalimide ring: 1 nitrogen.
     - Total N = 1.
   - **Phosphorus (P)**:
     - From "P": 1 phosphorus.
     - Total P = 1.
   - **Sulfur (S)**:
     - From "(=S)": 1 sulfur.
     - Total S = 1.

   Molecular formula: **C12H14O4NPS**

3. **Calculate the Molecular Weight**:
   - Atomic masses (approximate values, commonly used in chemistry):
     - C: 12.01 g/mol
     - H: 1.008 g/mol
     - O: 16.00 g/mol
     - N: 14.01 g/mol
     - P: 30.97 g/mol
     - S: 32.06 g/mol
   - Total mass:
     - C: 12 × 12.01 = 144.12
     - H: 14 × 1.008 = 14.112
     - O: 4 × 16.00 = 64.00
     - N: 1 × 14.01 = 14.01
     - P: 1 × 30.97 = 30.97
     - S: 1 × 32.06 = 32.06
   - Sum = 144.12 + 14.112 + 64.00 + 14.01 + 30.97 + 32.06 = **299.282 g/mol**

4. **Cross-Check with Similar Molecules**:
   - A closely related molecule in the dataset is **CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O**, with a molecular weight of 393.854 g/mol. This molecule has an additional "SC(CCl)" group (a sulfur and a chlorinated ethyl group), which accounts for the extra mass (S: 32.06, C2H4Cl: ~63.5, totaling ~95.5 g/mol difference). Removing this group should yield a molecular weight close to 393.854 - 95.5 ≈ 298.354 g/mol, which aligns well with my calculated value of 299.282 g/mol (slight discrepancy due to rounding of atomic masses).

### Predicted Property Value:
The predicted molecular weight for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc
==================================================
Iteration: 34
SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 188.23
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I will predict the property value for the molecule **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**. Since the property values are not explicitly labeled (e.g., molecular weight, boiling point, etc.), I will assume they represent a common property like molecular weight, as the values seem to align with typical molecular weights for organic compounds. My analysis will focus on structural similarity and molecular composition to estimate the property value.

### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule
The SMILES string for the target molecule is **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C**, which represents a heterocyclic compound. Let's break it down:
- **c1cc(=O)n...n1**: This indicates a five-membered ring with two nitrogen atoms and a carbonyl group (C=O), suggesting a structure similar to an oxadiazole or pyrazolone ring.
- **C** (attached to the ring): A methyl group (-CH3).
- **c2ccccc2**: A phenyl group (benzene ring) attached to one of the nitrogens.
- **C** (attached to the other nitrogen): Another methyl group (-CH3).

This molecule appears to be a substituted pyrazolone or a similar structure with a phenyl group and two methyl groups. The core structure is likely a 1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone or a close variant.

### Step 2: Estimate Molecular Weight (Assuming Property is Molecular Weight)
Since the property values in the dataset seem to correspond to molecular weights (e.g., CCCCOC = 88.15, close to the molecular weight of pentyl alcohol or ether), I will calculate the approximate molecular weight of the target molecule based on its composition:
- Carbon atoms: Count from SMILES, there are 6 (from phenyl) + 3 (from ring and methyls) = 9 carbons.
- Hydrogen atoms: Phenyl (C6H5, since one H is replaced) contributes 5H, two methyl groups (CH3) contribute 6H, and the ring structure likely contributes minimal additional H due to double bonds and substitutions. Total ~11H.
- Nitrogen atoms: 2 (from the ring).
- Oxygen atom: 1 (from C=O).

Approximate molecular formula: C9H11N2O (though exact structure may adjust this slightly).
- Carbon: 9 * 12 = 108
- Hydrogen: 11 * 1 = 11
- Nitrogen: 2 * 14 = 28
- Oxygen: 1 * 16 = 16
- Total estimated molecular weight: 108 + 11 + 28 + 16 = **163 g/mol**.

However, revisiting the SMILES, the exact structure (1-phenyl-3-methyl-5-pyrazolone or similar) might have a formula closer to C10H10N2O (if the ring is fully accounted for):
- Carbon: 10 * 12 = 120
- Hydrogen: 10 * 1 = 10
- Nitrogen: 2 * 14 = 28
- Oxygen: 1 * 16 = 16
- Total: 120 + 10 + 28 + 16 = **174 g/mol**.

### Step 3: Compare with Similar Molecules in the Dataset
Now, I will look for structurally similar molecules in the provided dataset to refine my prediction:
- **c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32** (indole derivative, property = 167.211): Contains a fused ring with nitrogen and a phenyl group, similar to the phenyl substitution in the target.
- **O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23** (property = 226.235): Contains a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen, oxygen, and phenyl, though more complex.
- **Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2** (property = 146.153): A smaller heterocyclic compound with methyl substitution.

The target molecule has a five-membered heterocyclic ring with two nitrogens, a phenyl group, and methyl substitutions, which is somewhat similar to indole or other nitrogen-containing heterocycles. The property value should be close to compounds with similar molecular complexity and weight (around 160–180).

### Step 4: Final Prediction
Based on the estimated molecular weight of approximately 174 g/mol and comparison with similar molecules like indole (167.211), I predict the property value for **Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C** to be in the range of 170–180. Adjusting for the exact structure and dataset trends, I will refine my prediction slightly higher due to the additional substitutions compared to indole.

**Predicted Property Value: 176.20**

This value is an educated guess based on molecular composition and structural similarity to

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 144.21399999999997
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being described for each molecule is the molecular weight (or molar mass) in grams per mole (g/mol). This conclusion is drawn from the consistent correlation between the molecular structures (given in SMILES notation) and the numerical values, which align with typical molecular weights for organic compounds. For example, the molecule "CCCCC" (pentane) has a value of 72.151, which matches the molecular weight of C5H12 (5*12.01 + 12*1.008 = 72.15 g/mol), and "COC=O" (methyl formate) has a value of 60.052, matching C2H4O2 (2*12.01 + 4*1.008 + 2*16.00 = 60.05 g/mol).

Now, I will predict the molecular weight for the target molecule "CCCCCC(=O)OCC" using my knowledge of molecular structures and atomic weights.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES notation
The SMILES string "CCCCCC(=O)OCC" represents a molecule. Let's break it down:
- "CCCCCC" indicates a chain of 6 carbon atoms (a hexane backbone).
- "(=O)" indicates a double bond to an oxygen atom, suggesting a carbonyl group (C=O), which is typical of an ester or carboxylic acid. Given the context, it is likely part of an ester group since there is an "OCC" following.
- "OCC" indicates an oxygen atom connected to two carbon atoms, suggesting an ethoxy group (-O-CH2-CH3) attached to the carbonyl carbon.

Thus, the molecule is likely an ester, specifically hexanoic acid ethyl ester (ethyl hexanoate), with the structure CH3(CH2)4C(=O)OCH2CH3.

### Step 2: Determine the molecular formula
Let's count the atoms:
- Carbon atoms: 6 from the hexyl chain (CCCCCC) + 2 from the ethyl group (OCC) = 8 carbons.
- Hydrogen atoms: For the hexyl chain (CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C), it's 5 carbons with 2H each (10H) plus 1 terminal CH3 (3H), but since it's attached to the carbonyl, the last carbon has no hydrogens directly counted in the chain for ester. Let's write it as CH3(CH2)4C(=O)OCH2CH3:
  - Hexyl part: CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2- has 5 carbons with 2H each (10H) + 1 CH3 (3H) = 13H, but in ester, the carbonyl carbon is part of the chain, so it's CH3(CH2)4C, where the last C has no H (it's C=O).
  - Correctly: Hexanoic acid part is C6H11C(=O)-, so 5 carbons with 2H (10H) + 1 CH3 (3H) = 13H, but in acid form it's C5H11COOH, so C6H12O2, but in ester, it's C5H11C(=O)OR.
  - Ethyl part: OCH2CH3 has 2 carbons, CH2 (2H) + CH3 (3H) = 5H.
  - Total: Hexyl chain up to carbonyl carbon is C5H11-C(=O)-, so 5C (10H from CH2 + 3H from CH3 = 13H, but carbonyl C has no H), wait, standard formula for ethyl hexanoate is C8H16O2.
- Oxygen atoms: 2 (one in carbonyl C=O, one in ester linkage C-O-C).

Molecular formula: C8H16O2
- Carbons: 8
- Hydrogens: Hexyl part CH3(CH2)4- is 5 CH2/CH3 groups contributing 13H, but as ester it's CH3(CH2)4C(=O)-, so C6 chain with carbonyl, standard is C5H11C(=O)-, wait:
  - CH3-CH2-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-O-CH2-CH3
  - Hexyl: CH3 (3H), 4*CH2 (8H), carbonyl C (0H), so 11H from hexyl part.
  - Ethyl: CH2 (2H), CH3 (3H) = 5H.
  - Total H = 11 + 5 = 16H.
- Oxygens: 2.

So, molecular formula is C8H16O2.

### Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight
Using standard atomic weights (approximate values

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 136.14999999999998
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am tasked with predicting a property for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, which is the SMILES notation for methyl benzoate. The property values listed alongside the example molecules appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) in g/mol, as they align closely with the calculated molecular weights of the given compounds. For instance:

- Cn1ccc(=O)[nH]c1=O (uracil) has a listed value of 126.115, which is close to its molecular weight of approximately 112.09 g/mol (though there might be a slight discrepancy or typo in the data).
- CC(Cl)CCl (1,2-dichloropropane) has a value of 112.987, matching its molecular weight of approximately 112.99 g/mol.
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) has a value of 150.177, matching its molecular weight of approximately 150.17 g/mol.

Upon closer inspection, while some values match molecular weights exactly, others show slight deviations, suggesting possible rounding or minor errors in the dataset. However, the pattern strongly indicates that the property in question is the molecular weight (or a closely related mass-based property).

Now, let's calculate the molecular weight of the target molecule, COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate):

- Carbon (C): 8 atoms × 12.01 = 96.08 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 6 atoms × 1.008 = 6.048 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 2 atoms × 16.00 = 32.00 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 96.08 + 6.048 + 32.00 = 134.128 g/mol

Looking at the provided dataset, there is a similar molecule, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate), with a property value of 150.177, which matches its molecular weight (C9H10O2 = 150.17 g/mol). Methyl benzoate (C8H8O2) is structurally similar but has one less carbon and two fewer hydrogens due to the methyl group (CH3) instead of ethyl (C2H5), so its molecular weight should be lower by approximately 14 g/mol (difference between CH2, roughly). Indeed, 150.17 - 14 ≈ 136, which is close to 134.128, confirming the trend.

Since the property seems to be molecular weight, and my calculation yields 134.128 g/mol for methyl benzoate, I will predict this value. The dataset values are often rounded to three decimal places, so I will present it as 134.128.

**Predicted Property Value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1: 134.128**

Note: If the property is not molecular weight but something else (e.g., a physical property like boiling point or a computed value), the prediction would differ. However, based on the strong correlation between the provided values and molecular weights, this is the most reasonable assumption without additional context.
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 68.119
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am tasked with predicting a property for the molecule C=CCC=C. The data includes a list of molecules with their corresponding property values, which appear to be related to molecular weight or molar mass (given the numerical values and their correlation with molecular complexity). Since the property is not explicitly defined in the question, I will assume it is the molecular weight (in g/mol), as the values closely match the molar masses of the given molecules. I will proceed with this assumption and calculate the molecular weight for the target molecule based on its structure.

The molecule C=CCC=C can be interpreted as a hydrocarbon with the formula C5H8, representing a diene structure, likely 1,3-pentadiene or a similar isomer, where there are five carbon atoms and eight hydrogen atoms, with two double bonds.

To predict the property (assumed to be molecular weight), I will calculate the molar mass of C5H8:
- Carbon (C) has an atomic mass of approximately 12.01 g/mol.
- Hydrogen (H) has an atomic mass of approximately 1.008 g/mol.
- Therefore, for C5H8:
  - 5 carbons: 5 * 12.01 = 60.05 g/mol
  - 8 hydrogens: 8 * 1.008 = 8.064 g/mol
  - Total molar mass = 60.05 + 8.064 = 68.114 g/mol

Now, looking at the provided data, I notice that similar small hydrocarbons have property values close to their molar masses. For example:
- CC/C=C/C (which is C5H10, pentene) has a value of 70.135, very close to its molar mass of 70.13 g/mol.
- C1CCCC1 (cyclopentane, C5H10) also has a value of 70.135, matching its molar mass.

Since C=CCC=C (C5H8) has two fewer hydrogens than C5H10 due to the additional double bond, its molar mass should be slightly less, which aligns with my calculation of 68.114 g/mol.

Therefore, based on the pattern in the data and my calculation, I predict the property value for C=CCC=C to be approximately **68.114**.

**Final Answer: 68.114**
==================================================
Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 252.731
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I can infer that the property being described is likely the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, given the numerical values associated with each molecule and their correspondence to the approximate molecular weights of the compounds listed. The values are consistent with the sum of atomic masses of the elements in each molecule, often expressed in g/mol.

Let's analyze the molecule in question: **BrC(Br)Br**, which is tribromomethane (also known as bromoform). To predict its molecular weight, I will calculate it based on the atomic masses of its constituent atoms.

- The molecule has 1 carbon (C) atom and 3 bromine (Br) atoms.
- Atomic mass of carbon (C) ≈ 12.01 g/mol
- Atomic mass of bromine (Br) ≈ 79.90 g/mol

Now, calculate the molecular weight:
- Carbon: 1 × 12.01 = 12.01 g/mol
- Bromine: 3 × 79.90 = 239.70 g/mol
- Total molecular weight = 12.01 + 239.70 = 251.71 g/mol

To further validate this prediction, I can compare it with similar molecules from the provided list that contain halogens or have a similar structure. For instance:
- **FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br** (a halogenated methane derivative) has a value of 197.381, which aligns closely with its calculated molecular weight (F: 3×19, C: 12, Cl: 35.5, Br: 80 ≈ 197.5 g/mol).
- **Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1** (chloronaphthalene) has a value of 162.619, matching its approximate molecular weight.
- Other halogenated compounds like **Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl** (326.437) also align with their molecular weights.

Given the consistency of the provided values with molecular weights and the structure of **BrC(Br)Br**, I predict the property value (molecular weight) for **BrC(Br)Br** to be approximately **251.71**.

However, since the provided data often rounds to three decimal places or shows slight variations (likely due to isotopic averages or rounding conventions), I will round my prediction to match the format of the given data. Thus, my final predicted value for the property of **BrC(Br)Br** is **251.710**.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 393.85400000000016
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O. The property values in the dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they align closely with the calculated molecular weights of the given SMILES strings. For instance, c1ccc2ccccc2c1 (naphthalene) has a value of 128.174, which matches its molecular weight (C10H8 = 128.17 g/mol), and C (methane) has a value of 16.043, matching CH4 (16.04 g/mol). Therefore, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight.

To predict the molecular weight of the target molecule, I will break down its SMILES string, CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, into its constituent atoms and functional groups to calculate the total mass.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string represents a molecule with a thiophosphate group, an imide-like structure (phthalimide derivative), and a chlorinated side chain. Let's parse it:
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)**: This represents a thiophosphate group with two ethoxy groups (OCC) attached to phosphorus, and a double-bonded sulfur (=S).
- **S**: A sulfur atom connecting the thiophosphate to the rest of the molecule.
- **C(CCl)**: A carbon atom with a chlorine-substituted carbon (CCl) attached.
- **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**: This represents a phthalimide structure, where N is part of a five-membered imide ring fused to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1), with two carbonyl groups (C(=O)) closing the ring.

### Step 2: Count the Atoms
Let's systematically count the atoms in the molecule by breaking down the SMILES:
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)**:
  - Two ethoxy groups (OCC): Each is O-C-C, so 2 × (2C + 5H + 1O) = 4C, 10H, 2O.
  - P(=S): 1P, 1S.
- **S**: 1S (connecting sulfur).
- **C(CCl)**: Central carbon (1C), attached to CCl (1C, 1Cl), and implied hydrogens. Since it's connected to S and N (later), it likely has 1H (tertiary carbon).
  - Total: 2C, 1H, 1Cl.
- **N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O**:
  - Benzene ring (c1ccccc1): 6C, 4H (since two carbons are substituted by the imide ring).
  - Imide ring: N (1N), two carbonyls (2C, 2O), connected to the benzene ring.
  - Total: 8C (6 from benzene + 2 from carbonyls), 4H, 1N, 2O.

Now, combine all parts:
- **Carbon (C)**: 4 (from ethoxy) + 2 (from C(CCl)) + 8 (from phthalimide) = 14C
- **Hydrogen (H)**: 10 (from ethoxy) + 1 (from C(CCl)) + 4 (from benzene) = 15H
- **Oxygen (O)**: 2 (from ethoxy) + 2 (from carbonyls) = 4O
- **Phosphorus (P)**: 1P
- **Sulfur (S)**: 1 (from =S) + 1 (connecting S) = 2S
- **Nitrogen (N)**: 1N
- **Chlorine (Cl)**: 1Cl

### Step 3: Calculate Molecular Weight
Using approximate atomic masses (rounded to common values for simplicity, as the dataset values are precise to three decimal places):
- C: 12.011 g/mol
- H: 1.008 g/mol
- O: 15.999 g/mol
- P: 30.974 g/mol
- S: 32.06 g/mol
- N: 14.007 g/mol
- Cl: 35.45 g/mol

Now compute:
- C: 14 × 12.011 = 168.154
- H: 15 × 1.008 = 15.120
- O: 4 × 15.999 = 63.996

Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C. Since the property values in the examples are not explicitly labeled but appear to correspond to molecular weights or a related physical property (likely molecular weight given the context and numerical values), I will assume the property is molecular weight (in g/mol) and calculate it accordingly. If the property is something else, the prediction would need adjustment, but molecular weight seems the most plausible based on the data.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The molecule is represented in SMILES notation as CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C. Let's break it down to understand the structure:
- **CN(C)**: This represents a dimethylamino group, -N(CH₃)₂.
- **C(=O)**: This indicates a carbonyl group, part of an amide or urea-like linkage.
- **N**: A nitrogen atom connecting to the aromatic ring.
- **c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)**: This is a benzene ring with a chlorine (Cl) substituent ortho to the point of attachment of the nitrogen.
- **n2nc(oc2=O)**: This represents a heterocyclic ring, likely an oxazolidinone or related structure, with a nitrogen and oxygen in the ring and a carbonyl group.
- **C(C)(C)C**: This is a tert-butyl group, -C(CH₃)₃, attached to the heterocyclic ring.

Overall, the molecule appears to be a substituted urea or amide derivative with a chlorinated benzene ring and a heterocyclic moiety bearing a tert-butyl group.

### Step 2: Calculate Molecular Weight
To predict the property as molecular weight, I will count the atoms in the molecule based on the SMILES string and sum their atomic masses.

- **Carbon (C)**: Let's count the carbons:
  - CN(C): 3 carbons (1 from CN, 2 from N(C)).
  - C(=O): 1 carbon.
  - c1ccc(c(Cl)c1): 6 carbons in the benzene ring.
  - n2nc(oc2=O): 1 carbon in the heterocyclic ring (from c2).
  - C(C)(C)C: 4 carbons (1 central carbon + 3 methyl carbons).
  - Total C = 3 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 4 = 15 carbons.
- **Hydrogen (H)**: Count hydrogens based on valency:
  - CN(C): The two methyl groups are -CH₃ each, so 6H.
  - Benzene ring c1ccc(c(Cl)c1): Normally 6H, but one H is replaced by N (from Nc1), and one position has Cl, so 4H remain on the ring.
  - C(C)(C)C: Tert-butyl group has 9H (central C has no H, each methyl has 3H).
  - Total H = 6 + 4 + 9 = 19 hydrogens.
- **Nitrogen (N)**: Count nitrogens:
  - CN(C): 1N.
  - Nc1: 1N.
  - n2nc: 2N in the heterocyclic ring.
  - Total N = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 nitrogens.
- **Oxygen (O)**: Count oxygens:
  - C(=O): 1O.
  - oc2=O: 2O (one in the ring, one in the carbonyl).
  - Total O = 1 + 2 = 3 oxygens.
- **Chlorine (Cl)**: 1 Cl from c(Cl).

Now, calculate the molecular weight using approximate atomic masses (C=12, H=1, N=14, O=16, Cl=35.5):
- C: 15 × 12 = 180
- H: 19 × 1 = 19
- N: 4 × 14 = 56
- O: 3 × 16 = 48
- Cl: 1 × 35.5 = 35.5
- Total = 180 + 19 + 56 + 48 + 35.5 = 338.5 g/mol

### Step 3: Cross-Check with Examples
Looking at the provided examples, the property values range from around 70 to over 400, and many seem to align closely with molecular weights (e.g., CCCCCCCCl = 134.65, close to calculated MW of C7H15Cl ≈ 134.65). My calculated value of 338.5
==================================================
Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 289.545
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl`. The property values in the given dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they are consistent with the calculated molecular weights for the provided SMILES strings when considering standard atomic masses (e.g., C=12, H=1, O=16, Cl=35.5, etc.). Therefore, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl` describes a molecule with two aromatic rings connected by an oxygen atom (ether linkage). Let's break it down:
- `O`: An oxygen atom, likely part of a hydroxyl group.
- `c1cc(Cl)ccc1`: A benzene ring (`c1...c1` indicates a ring closure) with a chlorine (Cl) substituent.
- `O`: Another oxygen atom, likely the ether linkage between the two rings.
- `c2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl`: Another benzene ring (`c2...c2`) with two chlorine (Cl) substituents.

Thus, the molecule consists of:
- Two benzene rings.
- One ether linkage (-O-) connecting the rings.
- One hydroxyl group (-OH) on the first ring.
- One chlorine on the first ring.
- Two chlorines on the second ring.

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
To calculate the molecular weight, I need the molecular formula by counting the atoms:
- **Carbon (C)**: Each benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms, so 6 + 6 = 12 carbons.
- **Hydrogen (H)**: 
  - First ring: A benzene ring (C6H6) with two substituents (OH and Cl, replacing two H atoms) and connected to the ether oxygen (which replaces another H), but in SMILES, the ether oxygen is explicitly shown, so we consider the base as C6H6 minus H atoms replaced by substituents. First ring has OH, Cl, and O (ether), so 6H - 3H = 3H.
  - Second ring: Benzene (C6H6) with two Cl substituents and one O (ether), so 6H - 3H = 3H.
  - Total H = 3 + 3 = 6.
- **Oxygen (O)**: One from the hydroxyl group (OH) and one from the ether linkage, so 2 oxygens.
- **Chlorine (Cl)**: One on the first ring and two on the second ring, so 3 chlorines.

Molecular formula: C12H6O2Cl3

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using approximate atomic masses (commonly used in chemistry for quick calculations):
- C: 12 g/mol
- H: 1 g/mol
- O: 16 g/mol
- Cl: 35.5 g/mol

Molecular weight = (12 × 12) + (6 × 1) + (2 × 16) + (3 × 35.5)
= 144 + 6 + 32 + 106.5
= 288.5 g/mol

### Step 4: Compare with Similar Molecules in the Dataset
To validate, I can compare with similar molecules in the dataset:
- `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl` (C6H3OCl2): Property = 163.003, calculated as (6×12) + (3×1) + 16 + (2×35.5) = 72 + 3 + 16 + 71 = 162, close to 163.003.
- `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2` (C12H8Cl2): Property = 223.102, calculated as (12×12) + (8×1) + (2×35.5) = 144 + 8 + 71 = 223, matches closely.

My calculation for C12H6O2Cl3 (288.5) seems reasonable, though I note that the dataset values sometimes have slight deviations (likely due to precise atomic masses or rounding). Adjusting for precision (Cl is often 35.45 in exact calculations), recalculating:
- Cl: 35.45 × 3 = 106.35
- Total = 144 + 6 + 32 + 106.35 = 288.35

### Step 5: Final Prediction
Considering the dataset's precision (values like 163.003, 223.102), I will round
==================================================
Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 70.135
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I can infer that the property being described is likely the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, given the numerical values and their correlation with the molecular formulas represented by the SMILES strings. Molecular weight is a fundamental property of a molecule, calculated as the sum of the atomic weights of all atoms in the molecule, and the values in the dataset appear consistent with this interpretation.

Let's analyze the molecule in question: **CC/C=C\C**, which represents the SMILES notation for 2-pentene (CH3-CH=CH-CH2-CH3). This is a five-carbon alkene with a double bond between the second and third carbon atoms.

To predict the molecular weight:
- The molecular formula of 2-pentene is C5H10.
- Carbon (C) has an atomic weight of approximately 12.01 g/mol, and hydrogen (H) has an atomic weight of approximately 1.008 g/mol.
- Therefore, the molecular weight is calculated as:
  - 5 carbons: 5 × 12.01 = 60.05 g/mol
  - 10 hydrogens: 10 × 1.008 = 10.08 g/mol
  - Total = 60.05 + 10.08 = 70.13 g/mol

Looking at the provided dataset, there is a very similar molecule, **CC/C=C/C**, which is listed with a property value of 70.135. This molecule also represents pentene (likely 1-pentene or 2-pentene, depending on the exact interpretation of the SMILES string). The value 70.135 is extremely close to my calculated value of 70.13, confirming that the property is indeed molecular weight and that my calculation is accurate.

Since **CC/C=C\C** represents 2-pentene, which has the same molecular formula (C5H10) as the listed molecule **CC/C=C/C**, the molecular weight should be identical. Therefore, I predict the property value for **CC/C=C\C** to be **70.135**, matching the value provided for the similar molecule in the dataset.

**Predicted Property Value: 70.135**
==================================================
Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 88.14999999999999
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being described for each molecule is the molecular weight (or molar mass) in grams per mole (g/mol). This conclusion is drawn from the fact that the values correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the given molecules. For example:

- CC(C)O (isopropanol) has a molecular weight of approximately 60.096 g/mol.
- C (methane, CH₄) has a molecular weight of approximately 16.043 g/mol.
- CC#C (propyne, C₃H₄) has a molecular weight of approximately 40.065 g/mol.

Thus, the task is to predict the molecular weight of the molecule CCCOCC.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The molecule is given as CCCOCC in SMILES notation. Let's break it down:
- "C" represents a carbon atom.
- "O" represents an oxygen atom.
- The sequence CCCOCC indicates a chain of atoms: carbon-carbon-carbon-oxygen-carbon-carbon.

This corresponds to the molecular formula C₅H₁₂O, as each carbon in a chain typically has implicit hydrogens to satisfy its valency (4 bonds). Let's assign the structure:
- The first three "C"s form a propane-like chain: CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-.
- Then "O" indicates an oxygen atom, likely forming an ether linkage.
- The last two "C"s form another ethyl-like chain: -CH₂-CH₃.

So, CCCOCC represents CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-O-CH₂-CH₃, which is dipropyl ether (or more specifically, 1-propoxypropane, though commonly just called propyl ether). The molecular formula is:
- Carbon: 6 atoms (3 from the first propyl group, 3 from the second propyl group, but in SMILES CCCOCC, it's 3 C's before O and 2 C's after, so total 5 C's? Let's correct this.
- In SMILES, CCCOCC is C-C-C-O-C-C, so 6 carbons total.

Let's count correctly:
- CCCOCC: C1-C2-C3-O-C4-C5.
- In SMILES, each "C" is a carbon atom, so CCCOCC has 5 C's and 1 O.
- Structure: CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-O-CH₂-CH₃.
- Carbon count: 5 (3 from propyl, 2 from ethyl? No: CH₃-CH₂-CH₂- is 3 C's, -O-CH₂-CH₃ is 2 C's, total 5 C's).
- Hydrogen count: First CH₃ (3H), second CH₂ (2H), third CH₂ (2H), fourth CH₂ (2H), fifth CH₃ (3H), total 3+2+2+2+3 = 12 H's.
- Oxygen: 1.

So, molecular formula is C₅H₁₂O.

I apologize for the earlier confusion. Let's confirm:
- SMILES CCCOCC: C-C-C-O-C-C is indeed 6 atoms, but in standard SMILES, each "C" is one carbon, so CCCOCC is C1-C2-C3-O-C4-C5, which is 5 carbons.
- Structure: CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-O-CH₂-CH₃.
- Carbons: 5.
- Hydrogens: 12.
- Oxygen: 1.
- Formula: C₅H₁₂O.

I see my error. In SMILES, CCCOCC is:
- C (carbon 1)
- C (carbon 2)
- C (carbon 3)
- O (oxygen)
- C (carbon 4)
- C (carbon 5)

So, 5 carbons, 1 oxygen. Structure is CH₃-CH₂-CH₂-O-CH₂-CH₃, which is correct as C₅H₁₂O.

### Step 2: Calculate Molecular Weight
Now, calculate the molecular weight of C₅H₁₂O:
- Carbon: 5 atoms × 12.011 g/mol = 60.055 g/mol
- Hydrogen: 12 atoms × 1.008 g/mol = 12.096 g/mol
- Oxygen: 1 atom × 15.999 g/mol = 15.999 g/mol
- Total = 60.055 + 12.096 + 15.999 = 88.150 g/mol

### Step 3: Cross-Check with Similar Molecules
Looking at the provided data for similar molecules:
- CCC(O)CC (pentan-3-ol, C₅H₁₂O) has a value
==================================================
Iteration: 44
SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 268.36
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being predicted is the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the molecules, as the values given correspond closely to the molecular weights of the compounds when calculated manually. For instance, methane (C) has a value of 16.043, which matches its molecular weight, and ethanol (CCO) or similar small molecules also align with their respective molar masses.

Now, let's predict the molecular weight of the target molecule: **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2**. I'll break down the molecular structure based on the SMILES notation and calculate the approximate molecular weight manually by identifying the atoms and their contributions.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES string
The SMILES string **CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** can be interpreted as follows:
- **C**: A carbon atom, likely part of a methyl group (CH3) attached to nitrogen.
- **N**: A nitrogen atom, central to the structure.
- **(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)**: This indicates a urea-like or amide-like linkage:
  - **C(=O)**: A carbonyl group (C=O).
  - **N**: Another nitrogen atom.
  - **C(C)(C)**: A carbon atom with two methyl groups, i.e., a tert-butyl-like group (though in SMILES, this might be interpreted differently, it likely means a carbon with two additional carbons, suggesting a branched structure).
  - **c1ccccc1**: A phenyl ring (C6H5-), indicating a benzene ring attached to the carbon or nitrogen.
- **c2ccccc2**: Another phenyl ring (C6H5-) attached to the central nitrogen.

A more careful interpretation suggests this is likely a urea derivative with two phenyl groups and a substituted carbon. The structure can be understood as a molecule like N,N-diphenyl-N'-tert-butylurea or similar, where:
- The central nitrogen (N) is connected to a methyl group (C, likely CH3), a phenyl group (c2ccccc2), and a carbonyl group (C(=O)).
- The carbonyl is connected to another nitrogen (N), which is further connected to a carbon with two methyl groups (C(C)(C)) and a phenyl group (c1ccccc1).

However, in SMILES, **C(C)(C)** likely indicates a carbon atom with two additional carbon atoms as branches, but in the context of being attached to a phenyl ring, it might be better interpreted as a carbon attached to the phenyl with two methyl groups, i.e., a 1,1-dimethylethylphenyl or similar group. For simplicity, let's count the atoms.

### Step 2: Count the atoms
Let's break it down to individual atoms:
- **c1ccccc1**: A benzene ring, which is C6H5- (when attached), so 6 carbons, but hydrogen count depends on substitution. Since it's attached, it's C6H5.
- **c2ccccc2**: Another benzene ring, also C6H5.
- **CN**: Likely CH3-N, so 1 carbon (from methyl) and 1 nitrogen.
- **C(=O)**: 1 carbon and 1 oxygen.
- **N**: Another nitrogen.
- **C(C)(C)**: A carbon atom with two additional carbons, likely representing a tert-butyl-like structure, but since it's attached to a phenyl, let's interpret it as a carbon (central) with two methyl groups (2 carbons), so total 3 carbons (C(CH3)2-).

However, in SMILES, **C(C)(C)c1ccccc1** likely means a carbon atom connected to two carbons (methyl groups) and to the phenyl ring, so:
- Central carbon: 1 C.
- Two methyl groups: 2 C (each CH3).
- Phenyl: 6 C.

Total carbons so far:
- From first phenyl (c1ccccc1): 6 C.
- From second phenyl (c2ccccc2): 6 C.
- From CN: 1 C (methyl).
- From C(=O): 1 C.
- From C(C)(C): 1 C (central) + 2 C (methyls) = 3 C.
- Total carbons = 6 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 17 C.

Nitrogen atoms:
- Two N atoms (one from CN, one from NC(=O)).

Oxygen atoms:
- One O from C(=O).

Now, hydrogens:
- First phenyl (c1ccccc1): Attached to C(C)(C), so it's C6H5 (5 H, since one position is
==================================================
Iteration: 45
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 214.062
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am tasked with predicting a property for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, which is N-(4-bromophenyl)acetamide, using the examples given. The property values listed alongside the SMILES strings of various molecules appear to correspond to molecular weights (in g/mol), as they align closely with the calculated molecular weights of the compounds when considering their atomic compositions.

To predict the property for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, I will calculate its molecular weight based on its structure, as the property seems to be molecular weight. Let's break down the molecule:

- **SMILES notation**: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
- **Interpretation**: This represents an acetamide group (CC(=O)N) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccc cc1) with a bromine (Br) substituent at the para position relative to the amide nitrogen (N).

Now, let's count the atoms:
- Carbon (C): 8 (2 from the acetyl group, 6 from the benzene ring)
- Hydrogen (H): 8 (3 from the methyl group, 4 from the benzene ring, 1 from the amide NH)
- Nitrogen (N): 1 (from the amide)
- Oxygen (O): 1 (from the carbonyl)
- Bromine (Br): 1 (substituent on the benzene ring)

Next, I will calculate the molecular weight using approximate atomic weights:
- C: 12.01 g/mol × 8 = 96.08
- H: 1.008 g/mol × 8 = 8.064
- N: 14.01 g/mol × 1 = 14.01
- O: 16.00 g/mol × 1 = 16.00
- Br: 79.90 g/mol × 1 = 79.90

Total molecular weight = 96.08 + 8.064 + 14.01 + 16.00 + 79.90 = 214.054 g/mol

To confirm the trend in the provided data, I note that the property values match closely with molecular weights for several examples:
- CO (methanol): 32.042 (close to 32.04)
- CCS (ethanethiol): 62.137 (close to 62.13)
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (1,3-dichlorobenzene): 147.004 (close to 147.00)
- Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 (4-bromophenol): 173.009 (close to 173.01)

Given this consistency, the property is indeed molecular weight. For similar molecules in the dataset, such as Cc1ccc(N)cc1 (p-toluidine, 107.156, close to 107.15) and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 (4-bromophenol, 173.009), the values align with molecular weights.

Thus, for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, the predicted property (molecular weight) is approximately 214.05 g/mol. Rounding to three decimal places as in the dataset, the value is 214.054, but considering the precision in the examples (often to three decimal places), I will present it as 214.054.

However, I notice that for some molecules with bromine, like Fc1cccc(Br)c1 (175.0, close to 174.98), the value is rounded. To be consistent with the dataset's precision, I will round to three decimal places if necessary, but since my calculation is precise, I will keep it as is.

To double-check, I will compare with a structurally similar molecule in the dataset, such as Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 (4-bromophenol, 173.009). Replacing the OH (17 g/mol) with NHCOCH3 (acetamide group, approximately 58 g/mol: N=14, C=24, O=16, H=3*1), the difference is about 41 g/mol, so 173 + 41 = 214, which matches my calculation.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is **214.054**.

**Final Answer**: 214.054
==================================================
Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 134.22199999999998
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (which is cumene or isopropylbenzene, a benzene ring substituted with an isopropyl group). The property in question appears to be the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values given in the examples closely match the calculated molar masses of the respective molecules (e.g., CC(C)CO is isobutanol with a molar mass of approximately 74.12 g/mol, CCCCCCC#C is 1-octyne with a molar mass of approximately 110.2 g/mol, etc.).

### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule
The molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** can be interpreted as a benzene ring (C6H6) with a substituent group -CH2-CH(CH3)2, which is an isobutyl-like group, but more accurately, it represents cumene (isopropylbenzene), where the carbon directly attached to the benzene is bonded to two methyl groups. Let's break it down:
- **c1ccccc1** represents a benzene ring (C6H6).
- **CC(C)C** attached to the benzene indicates a carbon chain where the first carbon (attached to benzene) is bonded to two methyl groups (C(CH3)2-), forming -CH(CH3)2.
- Thus, the full structure is C6H5-CH(CH3)2, which is cumene.

### Step 2: Calculate the Molecular Formula
- Benzene ring: C6H5- (since one hydrogen is replaced by the substituent).
- Substituent: -CH(CH3)2, which is C3H7 (one carbon with two methyl groups and one hydrogen, but in terms of counting, it's C3H7 when attached).
- Total carbon atoms: 6 (from benzene) + 3 (from isopropyl) = 9.
- Total hydrogen atoms: 5 (from benzene, since one H is replaced) + 7 (from isopropyl) = 12.
- Molecular formula: C9H12.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molar Mass
- Carbon (C): Atomic mass = 12.011 g/mol; 9 carbons = 9 * 12.011 = 108.099 g/mol.
- Hydrogen (H): Atomic mass = 1.008 g/mol; 12 hydrogens = 12 * 1.008 = 12.096 g/mol.
- Total molar mass = 108.099 + 12.096 = 120.195 g/mol.

### Step 4: Cross-Check with Similar Molecules in the Dataset
Looking at the provided dataset for molecules with similar structures:
- **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene or similar isomer): Property value = 120.195, which matches the molar mass of C9H12 (same as cumene).
- **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1** (isopropyltoluene or similar): Property value = 134.222, which corresponds to C10H14 (one additional carbon and two hydrogens compared to cumene).

Since **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (cumene, C9H12) has the same molecular formula as **CCc1ccc(C)cc1** (ethyltoluene, also C9H12), their molar masses should be identical, which is 120.195 g/mol.

### Step 5: Predict the Property Value
Given that the property appears to be molar mass and the calculated molar mass of **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** (cumene) is 120.195 g/mol, and this matches the value for a similar C9H12 compound in the dataset, I predict the property value to be **120.195**.

### Final Answer
The predicted property value for the molecule **CC(C)Cc1ccccc1** is **120.195**.
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 106.12399999999997
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am tasked with predicting a property for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, which is benzaldehyde (C6H5CHO), using the examples given. The property values listed alongside the molecules appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) in g/mol, as they align closely with the calculated molecular weights of the compounds when interpreted through their SMILES notations.

To confirm this, let's examine a few examples:
- COc1ccccc1 (anisole, C7H8O) has a property value of 108.14, which matches its molecular weight (7*12.01 + 8*1.008 + 16.00 = 108.14 g/mol).
- CCO (ethanol, C2H6O) has a property value of 46.069, matching its molecular weight (2*12.01 + 6*1.008 + 16.00 = 46.068 g/mol).
- ClCCCCl (1,2-dichloroethane, C2H4Cl2) has a property value of 112.987, which is close to its molecular weight (2*12.01 + 4*1.008 + 2*35.45 = 98.96 g/mol), though there is a slight discrepancy possibly due to rounding or isotopic considerations in the data.

Upon closer inspection, there are inconsistencies in my initial assumption for some molecules. For instance, ClCCCCl's expected molecular weight is approximately 98.96 g/mol, but the value given is 112.987, which suggests a possible error in the data or a different property being measured. However, for many simpler molecules, the values are very close to molecular weights. Given the context and the pattern (most values are in the range of typical molecular weights), I will proceed with the assumption that the property is molecular weight, acknowledging that there might be slight deviations or errors in the provided data.

Now, for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, which is benzaldehyde (C7H6O):
- Carbon (C): 7 atoms * 12.01 g/mol = 84.07 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 6 atoms * 1.008 g/mol = 6.048 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 1 atom * 16.00 g/mol = 16.00 g/mol
- Total molecular weight = 84.07 + 6.048 + 16.00 = 106.118 g/mol

Rounding to three decimal places, as most of the provided data is formatted, the predicted property value (molecular weight) for benzaldehyde is approximately 106.118 g/mol.

To further validate, I can compare with similar molecules in the dataset:
- COc1ccccc1 (anisole, C7H8O) has a value of 108.14, which is close to benzaldehyde's calculated weight, differing only by the replacement of -CHO with -OCH3, a small difference in mass.
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (salicylamide, C7H7NO2) has a value of 137.138, which is higher due to additional atoms.

Given the pattern and my calculation, I am confident that the property is molecular weight or a closely related property. Therefore, my predicted property value for O=Cc1ccccc1 is **106.118**.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 238.159
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2. From the context of the examples, it appears that the property being measured is likely the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the given SMILES strings.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 represents a specific molecular structure. Let's break it down:
- "O=C2" indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) connected to a carbon (labeled as 2 for ring closure).
- "CN" suggests a carbon-nitrogen connection.
- "N(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)" indicates a nitrogen atom connected to another nitrogen via a double bond to a carbon, which is part of a ring (labeled 1) containing oxygen (o1) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O).
- "C(=O)N2" indicates another carbonyl group connected to a nitrogen, closing the ring at position 2.

This structure appears to be a heterocyclic compound, likely a derivative of a hydantoin or imidazolidine ring with a substituent containing a furan ring and a nitro group.

### Step 2: Estimate the Molecular Formula
To predict the molecular weight, I will deduce the approximate molecular formula based on the SMILES string:
- The core structure seems to be a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and nitrogens, resembling a hydantoin-like structure (C3H4N2O2).
- The substituent "N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O" suggests a furan ring (C4H3O) with a nitro group (NO2) and a connecting imine (N=C), adding additional atoms.

Counting the atoms:
- Carbons: Approximately 3 (from the core) + 5 (from the furan and connecting carbon) = 8 carbons.
- Hydrogens: Likely 4-6 hydrogens based on the structure (core and substituent).
- Nitrogens: 3 (2 from the core, 1 from the nitro group, and possibly imine).
- Oxygens: 2 (from carbonyls) + 1 (from furan) + 2 (from nitro) = 5 oxygens.

A rough molecular formula might be C8H5N3O5 (adjusting hydrogens for valency).

### Step 3: Calculate Approximate Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (C=12, H=1, N=14, O=16):
- C8: 8 * 12 = 96
- H5: 5 * 1 = 5
- N3: 3 * 14 = 42
- O5: 5 * 16 = 80
- Total = 96 + 5 + 42 + 80 = 223

This is a rough estimate. The exact structure might have slight variations in hydrogen count or connectivity, but this gives a starting point.

### Step 4: Compare with Similar Molecules
Looking at the provided dataset, I will identify molecules with similar functional groups or complexity to refine the prediction:
- Molecules with nitro groups and heterocyclic rings, such as "Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2" (284.098), have higher molecular weights due to additional atoms.
- Smaller heterocyclic compounds like "Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2" (169.567) have lower weights.
- The target molecule has a nitro group, a furan ring, and a hydantoin-like core, suggesting a molecular weight between 200 and 250, based on the complexity.

### Step 5: Refine the Prediction
My initial calculation of 223 seems reasonable, but I will cross-check the exact structure. The SMILES suggests a specific arrangement, and after mentally visualizing the structure, I believe the molecular formula might be closer to C7H5N3O5 (if one carbon is miscounted or hydrogens adjusted):
- C7: 7 * 12 = 84
- H5: 5 * 1 = 5
- N3: 3 * 14 = 42
- O5: 5 * 16 = 80
- Total = 84 + 5 + 42 + 80 = 211

However, considering the complexity and comparing to "OCC1OC(C(O)C1O)n2cnc3c(O)ncnc23" (268.229), which has a similar number of atoms

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 184.242
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I will predict the property value for the molecule **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** using my expertise in chemistry and molecular structure analysis. The property values in the dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they are consistent with the calculated molar masses of the given SMILES strings when interpreted as such. Therefore, I will assume the property being predicted is the molecular weight in g/mol.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** needs to be interpreted to understand the molecular structure. Let's break it down:
- **c1ccccc1** represents a benzene ring (C6H6, but in SMILES, hydrogens are implied).
- **Nc1ccccc1** indicates an aniline group, where **N** is a nitrogen atom bonded to a benzene ring, representing C6H5NH2 (aniline).
- **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** suggests a nitrogen atom (the central **N**) bonded to two groups: one is **Nc1ccccc1** (aniline, C6H5NH-), and the other is **c2ccccc2** (another benzene ring, C6H5-). However, the notation is ambiguous because **N** typically implies a nitrogen with three bonds, and the structure might be interpreted as a hydrazine derivative or a typo.

Upon closer inspection, this SMILES string likely intends to represent **N,N-diphenylhydrazine** or a similar structure, but it seems malformed. A more standard SMILES for N,N-diphenylhydrazine would be **c1ccccc1NNc2ccccc2**, indicating two phenyl groups connected via a hydrazine linkage (C6H5-NH-NH-C6H5). However, the given SMILES **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** might be a non-standard or erroneous representation. I will interpret it as **c1ccccc1N(N)c2ccccc2**, suggesting a central nitrogen with two phenyl substituents and possibly an implied hydrogen, forming a structure like (C6H5)2N-NH2 or a related compound. But the most logical interpretation, given the context and similarity to other entries, is that it represents **N,N-diphenylamine** (C6H5)2NH, though the SMILES doesn't perfectly match this.

Looking at the dataset, there is a similar compound: **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** with a property value of 182.226, which corresponds to azobenzene (C6H5N=NC6H5, molar mass 182.22 g/mol). The given SMILES **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** might be a typo or variant of a similar structure. I will assume it is intended to represent a diphenylamine-like structure or a hydrazine derivative.

### Step 2: Hypothesize the Structure
Given the ambiguity, I will hypothesize that **N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** is meant to represent **diphenylhydrazine** (C6H5NH-NHC6H5) or a similar compound. Let's calculate the molar mass for the most plausible structure:
- If interpreted as **c1ccccc1N(N)c2ccccc2**, it might suggest (C6H5)2N-NH2 or a tri-substituted nitrogen, which is chemically less likely without additional context.
- A more reasonable interpretation, aligning with common structures, is **c1ccccc1NNc2ccccc2**, which is 1,2-diphenylhydrazine (C6H5-NH-NH-C6H5).

Let's compute the molar mass for **C6H5-NH-NH-C6H5**:
- Carbon: 12 atoms × 12.01 = 144.12 g/mol
- Hydrogen: 12 atoms × 1.008 = 12.096 g/mol
- Nitrogen: 2 atoms × 14.007 = 28.014 g/mol
- Total molar mass = 144.12 + 12.096 + 28.014 = 184.23 g/mol

### Step 3: Compare with Dataset
In the dataset, a similar compound **N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2** has a property value of 182.226, which matches the molar mass of azobenzene (C12H10N2, 182.22 g/mol). My calculated value for diphenylhydrazine is 184.23 g/mol, which is very close, suggesting that the property is indeed molar mass and my interpretation is reasonable.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 182.179
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I can infer that the property being referred to in the examples is likely the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) of the compounds, given the numerical values associated with each SMILES string. These values correspond closely to the molecular weights of the molecules when calculated based on their atomic compositions. Therefore, I will predict the molecular weight for the given molecule: **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**.

Let's break down the SMILES string to determine the molecular structure and calculate its molecular weight manually.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES string
The SMILES string **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2** represents a cyclic molecule. Let's decode it:
- **O=C2**: Indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) where the carbon is labeled as atom 2.
- **N**: A nitrogen atom connected to the carbonyl carbon (atom 2).
- **C(=O)**: Another carbonyl group connected to the nitrogen.
- **C1(CCCC1)**: A cyclopentane ring (five carbons in a ring, labeled as 1, connecting back to itself). This carbon (C1) is connected to the previous carbonyl carbon.
- **C(=O)**: Another carbonyl group connected to the cyclopentane carbon (C1).
- **N2**: A nitrogen atom that closes the ring by connecting back to the carbon labeled 2.

This structure corresponds to a **barbituric acid derivative** with a cyclopentane ring fused or substituted at one of the carbons between the nitrogens. Specifically, it is a six-membered heterocyclic ring (a pyrimidine-like structure) with three carbonyl groups and two nitrogens, and a cyclopentane ring attached to one of the carbons in the heterocyclic ring.

### Step 2: Determine the molecular formula
From the SMILES, the structure can be interpreted as follows:
- The heterocyclic ring is likely a barbituric acid core: C4H2N2O3 (a six-membered ring with two nitrogens and three carbonyls).
- The **C1(CCCC1)** indicates a cyclopentane ring (C5H10), but since it is attached to the barbituric acid core at one carbon, we need to account for the shared carbon or substitution.

In SMILES, **C1(CCCC1)** means a carbon atom (part of the main chain) is connected to a cyclopentane ring, but since it's written as part of the main structure, the carbon labeled "1" is shared. However, in this context, the carbon "C1" is part of both the barbituric acid ring and the cyclopentane, but we interpret it as a spiro compound or a substituted structure.

After careful consideration, the structure is likely **1,3-diazaspiro[4.4]nonane-2,4,6-trione** or a similar spiro compound where the cyclopentane ring shares a carbon with the barbituric acid ring (a spiro junction at the carbon between the two nitrogens).

Counting the atoms:
- Barbituric acid core (C4H2N2O3) has 4 carbons, 2 hydrogens, 2 nitrogens, and 3 oxygens.
- The cyclopentane ring (C5H10) normally has 5 carbons and 10 hydrogens, but since it shares one carbon with the barbituric acid ring in a spiro fashion, we subtract the shared carbon's contribution appropriately. In a spiro[4.4] system, the shared carbon is counted once, so total carbons = 4 (from barbituric) + 5 (from cyclopentane) - 1 (shared) = 8 carbons.
- Hydrogens: In barbituric acid, the two nitrogens each have one hydrogen (H2), and in cyclopentane, each carbon typically has 2 hydrogens, but at the spiro junction, the shared carbon has no hydrogens (it's quaternary). So, cyclopentane contributes 4 carbons with 2H each (8H), and the barbituric acid contributes 2H from nitrogens. Total H = 8 + 2 = 10.
- Nitrogens: 2 (from barbituric acid).
- Oxygens: 3 (from barbituric acid).

Molecular formula: **C8H10N2O3**

### Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded for simplicity):
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol × 8 = 96.08
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol × 10 = 10.08
- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol × 2 =

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 257.547
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being described for each molecule is the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) in g/mol. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that the values correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the given molecules when considering their SMILES notations. For example:

- For `Clc1ccccc1Cl` (1,2-dichlorobenzene), the given value is 147.004, which matches the molecular weight of C6H4Cl2 (6*12 + 4*1 + 2*35.5 = 147).
- For `CCCCC(=O)CCCC` (nonanone), the value is 142.242, which matches C9H18O (9*12 + 18*1 + 16 = 142).
- For `N#Cc1ccccc1` (benzonitrile), the value is 103.124, which matches C7H5N (7*12 + 5*1 + 14 = 103).

Thus, the task is to predict the molecular weight of the molecule `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` based on its structure.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl` describes a molecule with two benzene rings connected by a single bond (biphenyl structure) with chlorine atoms attached at specific positions:
- The first ring (`c1ccc(cc1)`) is a benzene ring with a substituent at position 1 (connected to the second ring) and a chlorine (`Cl`) at position 4 (since `Clc1ccc(cc1)` indicates Cl on carbon 1 of the ring, but in standard notation, it's interpreted as para-substituted due to the ring closure).
- The second ring (`c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`) is another benzene ring with chlorine atoms at positions 2 and 2' (or equivalent positions, likely 2 and 6 relative to the connection point at position 1).

Breaking it down:
- `Clc1ccc(cc1)`: This is a benzene ring (c1 to c6, with c1 connected to Cl and c4 connected to the next part).
- `c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl`: This is the second benzene ring, where `c2` is the connection point to the first ring, and it has Cl atoms on the carbons adjacent to `c2` (positions 2 and 6 of the second ring).

Thus, the molecule is 4,2',6'-trichlorobiphenyl (or a similar isomer depending on exact numbering, but the molecular formula remains the same).

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
- **Carbon atoms**: Two benzene rings contribute 12 carbon atoms (6 per ring).
- **Hydrogen atoms**: Each benzene ring normally has 6 hydrogens, but:
  - First ring: Connected to Cl at position 4 and to the second ring at position 1, so 4 hydrogens remain (6 - 1 for Cl - 1 for ring connection).
  - Second ring: Connected to the first ring at position 1, and Cl at positions 2 and 6, so 3 hydrogens remain (6 - 1 for ring connection - 2 for Cl).
  - Total hydrogens = 4 (first ring) + 3 (second ring) = 7.
- **Chlorine atoms**: 3 Cl atoms (one on the first ring, two on the second ring).

So, the molecular formula is **C12H7Cl3**.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using approximate atomic masses (C = 12, H = 1, Cl = 35.5):
- Carbon: 12 * 12 = 144
- Hydrogen: 7 * 1 = 7
- Chlorine: 3 * 35.5 = 106.5
- Total molecular weight = 144 + 7 + 106.5 = **257.5**

Using more precise atomic masses (C = 12.011, H = 1.008, Cl = 35.453):
- Carbon: 12 * 12.011 = 144.132
- Hydrogen: 7 * 1.008 = 7.056
- Chlorine: 3 * 35.453 = 106.359
- Total molecular weight = 144.132 + 7.056 + 106.359 = **257.547**

### Step 4: Compare with Similar Molecules in the Dataset
To validate, I can compare with similar molecules in the provided list:

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 134.22199999999998
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am assuming the property in question is the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values given alongside each SMILES string appear to correspond closely to the molecular weights of the respective molecules. For instance, the molecule "CCCCOC" has a value of 88.15, which matches the molecular weight of pentyl methyl ether (C6H14O), and "ClCCCl" has a value of 98.96, which matches the molecular weight of 1,2-dichloroethane (C2H4Cl2). Therefore, I will predict the molecular weight for the given molecule "CCc1ccc(CC)cc1".

The SMILES string "CCc1ccc(CC)cc1" represents a benzene ring with two ethyl substituents. Let's break it down:
- "c1ccc cc1" indicates a benzene ring (a six-carbon aromatic ring).
- "CC" attached to one carbon of the ring represents an ethyl group (-CH2CH3).
- Another "CC" attached to another carbon of the ring represents a second ethyl group.
- The notation suggests the ethyl groups are likely in para positions (1,4-disubstituted benzene), as this is a common interpretation of such SMILES strings unless specified otherwise.

Thus, the molecule is 1,4-diethylbenzene (C6H4(C2H5)2). Now, let's calculate its molecular weight:
- Carbon atoms: 6 (from benzene) + 4 (from two ethyl groups, 2 carbons each) = 10 carbons.
- Hydrogen atoms: 4 (from benzene, since two hydrogens are replaced by ethyl groups) + 10 (from two ethyl groups, 5 hydrogens each) = 14 hydrogens.
- Molecular formula: C10H14.
- Molecular weight = (10 * 12.011) + (14 * 1.008) = 120.11 + 14.112 = 134.222 g/mol.

To confirm, I can compare this with similar molecules in the dataset. For example, "CCCCCCc1ccccc1" (heptylbenzene, C13H20) has a molecular weight of 176.298 g/mol, but the dataset lists 162.276, which is close enough to suggest it's molecular weight. Another example, "Cc1ccccc1N" (toluidine, C7H9N), has a listed value of 107.156, matching its molecular weight. This supports my assumption.

Given the pattern, I predict the property (molecular weight) for "CCc1ccc(CC)cc1" to be approximately **134.22**.

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 172.20899999999995
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being referred to is the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the molecules, as the values given correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the compounds listed (in g/mol). I will proceed with this assumption and predict the molecular weight for the given molecule: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, which is the SMILES notation for 4-aminobenzenesulfonamide (also known as sulfanilamide).

To predict the molecular weight, I will calculate it based on the atomic composition of the molecule. The SMILES string Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O represents a benzene ring with an amino group (-NH2) at position 1 and a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) at position 4. Let's break down the molecular formula:

- **Carbon (C):** There are 6 carbon atoms in the benzene ring.
- **Hydrogen (H):** The benzene ring has 4 hydrogens (since two positions are substituted). The amino group (-NH2) contributes 2 hydrogens, and the sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) contributes 2 hydrogens. Total H = 4 (ring) + 2 (NH2) + 2 (NH2) = 8.
- **Nitrogen (N):** There are 2 nitrogen atoms (one from the amino group and one from the sulfonamide group).
- **Sulfur (S):** There is 1 sulfur atom in the sulfonamide group.
- **Oxygen (O):** There are 2 oxygen atoms in the sulfonamide group (-SO2-).

Thus, the molecular formula is C6H8N2O2S.

Now, I will calculate the molecular weight using approximate atomic masses (commonly used values in chemistry):
- C: 12.01 g/mol
- H: 1.008 g/mol
- N: 14.01 g/mol
- O: 16.00 g/mol
- S: 32.06 g/mol

Molecular weight = (6 × 12.01) + (8 × 1.008) + (2 × 14.01) + (2 × 16.00) + (1 × 32.06)
= 72.06 + 8.064 + 28.02 + 32.00 + 32.06
= 172.204 g/mol

Rounding to three decimal places (as in the provided data), the predicted molecular weight is approximately **172.204**.

To further validate, I note that sulfanilamide is a well-known compound with a standard molecular weight of around 172.2 g/mol, which matches my calculation closely. Comparing with similar molecules in the dataset, such as Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (p-nitroaniline, 138.126 g/mol), which has a nitro group instead of a sulfonamide, the difference in mass (replacing -NO2 with -SO2NH2) aligns with the expected increase due to the additional atoms in the sulfonamide group.

Therefore, the predicted property value (molecular weight) for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is **172.204**.

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 202.256
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, the property being predicted appears to be the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the molecules, as the values given correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the compounds when considering their SMILES notations. The task is to predict the molecular weight of the molecule represented by the SMILES string `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34`.

Let's analyze the SMILES string to determine the structure of the molecule. The SMILES notation `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34` describes a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. Breaking it down:

- `c1ccc2c(c1)` indicates a benzene ring (ring 1) fused to another ring (ring 2).
- `c3cccc4` and `cccc2c34` suggest additional fused rings (ring 3 and ring 4), forming a larger polycyclic structure.
- The numbers in the SMILES string indicate ring closures, showing how the rings are connected.

This SMILES string corresponds to **phenanthrene**, a tricyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with the molecular formula C₁₄H₁₀. Phenanthrene consists of three fused benzene rings arranged in a non-linear fashion.

To calculate the molecular weight:
- Carbon (C): Atomic weight ≈ 12.01 g/mol, and there are 14 carbon atoms.
- Hydrogen (H): Atomic weight ≈ 1.008 g/mol, and there are 10 hydrogen atoms.

Molecular weight = (14 × 12.01) + (10 × 1.008)
= 168.14 + 10.08
= 178.22 g/mol

To confirm, I can compare this molecule to similar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the provided dataset:
- Naphthalene (C₁₀H₈, SMILES: `c1cccc2ccccc12`) is not directly listed, but anthracene-like or larger structures are present.
- A molecule like `c1ccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12` (a substituted anthracene or similar, value 242.321) and `Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32` (methyl anthracene, value 192.261) suggest anthracene (C₁₄H₁₀) as a base structure with a molecular weight around 178, matching our calculation.

Since phenanthrene and anthracene are isomers (both C₁₄H₁₀), they share the same molecular weight. Given the consistency in the dataset with molecular weights, I predict the property value for `c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34` (phenanthrene) to be approximately **178.22**.

Thus, the predicted property value is **178.22**.

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 288.255
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the given molecule, which appears to be a flavonoid or related polyphenolic compound. The property values in the dataset seem to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as the values are consistent with the expected masses calculated from the molecular formulas derived from the SMILES strings. For instance, ClCCl (dichloromethane) has a value of 84.933, which matches its molecular weight (C=12, Cl=35.45×2, total ≈ 84.9), and OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O (glucose) has a value of 180.156, matching its molecular weight (C6H12O6). Therefore, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight.

The molecule in question is given by the SMILES string: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3. Let's break down this structure to determine its molecular formula and calculate the molecular weight.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string represents a molecule with a flavanone-like structure, likely a derivative of naringenin or a similar flavonoid, given the presence of multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and a heterocyclic ring system. Let's parse the SMILES:

- **Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3**:
  - "O" represents oxygen, often as part of hydroxyl groups or ether linkages.
  - "c1", "c2", "c3" indicate ring closures, showing the presence of multiple aromatic or cyclic structures.
  - "C(=O)" indicates a carbonyl group.
  - The structure suggests a central chromanone-like core (a benzene ring fused to a heterocyclic ring with a carbonyl) connected to another aromatic ring, with several hydroxyl groups.

From this, I interpret the molecule as having:
- A flavanone backbone (two benzene rings connected via a heterocyclic ring with a carbonyl).
- Multiple hydroxyl groups on the aromatic rings.

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
By analyzing the SMILES and comparing it to known flavonoids, this molecule resembles naringenin (C15H12O5, molecular weight ≈ 272.25) or a closely related compound with additional hydroxyl groups. Let's count the atoms based on the SMILES:

- The core structure of flavanones typically has 15 carbon atoms (two benzene rings and a three-carbon bridge forming the heterocyclic ring).
- The SMILES indicates additional oxygen atoms as hydroxyl groups: "O" appears multiple times (likely 5 or 6 hydroxyl groups or ether oxygens).
- Let's deduce the exact formula by mapping:
  - "c2cc(O)c1" and "Oc1c2" suggest a benzene ring with two hydroxyls and fusion to another ring.
  - "C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)" indicates the heterocyclic ring with a carbonyl and an ether oxygen.
  - "c3ccc(O)c(O)c3" indicates a second benzene ring with two hydroxyl groups.

A reasonable molecular formula for this structure, based on flavanone derivatives, is likely C15H12O6 (if it has one additional hydroxyl compared to naringenin, which is C15H12O5). Let's calculate:

- Naringenin (C15H12O5) has a molecular weight of 272.25.
- Adding one more hydroxyl group (replacing H with OH, net addition of O, mass +16) gives C15H12O6, with a molecular weight of approximately 288.25.

Looking at the SMILES "Oc2cc(O)c1" and "c3ccc(O)c(O)c3", there are explicitly four "O" atoms as hydroxyls, plus one in "C(=O)" and one in "Oc1c2" (ether oxygen), totaling 6 oxygens, supporting C15H12O6.

### Step 3: Calculate Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights:
- Carbon (C): 12.011 × 15 = 180.165
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 × 12 = 12.096
- Oxygen (O): 16.00 × 6 = 96.00
- Total = 180.165 + 12.096 + 96.00 = 288.261

This value (288.261) is consistent with the expected molecular weight for a compound like eriodictyol (a tetrahydroxyflavanone, C15H12O6), which matches the SMILES pattern.

### Step 4: Compare with Dataset Trends
Looking at the dataset, compounds with similar complexity (e.g., flavonoids or polyphenolic structures) have
==================================================
Iteration: 56
SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 183.169
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**. The property values in the given dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they match closely with the calculated molecular weights of the molecules when considering their atomic compositions. Therefore, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight (in g/mol).

### Step 1: Determine the Molecular Formula
Let's break down the SMILES notation **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** to derive the molecular formula.

- **C**: Carbon
- **O**: Oxygen
- **P**: Phosphorus
- **N**: Nitrogen
- **S**: Sulfur
- **H**: Hydrogen (implied in SMILES notation based on valency)

Interpreting the SMILES string:
- **CO**: A carbon atom bonded to an oxygen (likely a methoxy group, CH3O-).
- **P(=O)**: A phosphorus atom double-bonded to an oxygen.
- **(NC(C)=O)**: A nitrogen atom bonded to a carbon, which is part of an acetyl group (NC(C)=O suggests -NH-C(=O)-CH3, an acetamide group).
- **SC**: A sulfur atom bonded to a carbon (likely a methylthio group, -S-CH3).

Thus, the structure can be interpreted as:
- Phosphorus is the central atom, bonded to:
  - One oxygen (double bond, =O)
  - One methoxy group (-O-CH3)
  - One acetamide group (-NH-C(=O)-CH3)
  - One methylthio group (-S-CH3)

Now, let's count the atoms:
- **Carbon (C)**: 
  - 1 from methoxy (-O-CH3)
  - 2 from acetamide (-NH-C(=O)-CH3)
  - 1 from methylthio (-S-CH3)
  - Total C = 4
- **Hydrogen (H)**:
  - 3 from methoxy (-O-CH3)
  - 3 from acetamide's methyl (-C(=O)-CH3)
  - 1 from acetamide's NH (-NH-)
  - 3 from methylthio (-S-CH3)
  - Total H = 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 = 10
- **Oxygen (O)**:
  - 1 from methoxy (-O-CH3)
  - 1 from phosphorus double bond (=O)
  - 1 from acetamide carbonyl (-C(=O)-)
  - Total O = 3
- **Nitrogen (N)**: 1 from acetamide (-NH-)
- **Phosphorus (P)**: 1
- **Sulfur (S)**: 1 from methylthio (-S-)

So, the molecular formula is **C4H10NO3PS**.

### Step 2: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded to three decimal places for consistency with the dataset):
- C: 12.011 g/mol
- H: 1.008 g/mol
- O: 15.999 g/mol
- N: 14.007 g/mol
- P: 30.974 g/mol
- S: 32.06 g/mol

Now, calculate the molecular weight:
- C: 4 × 12.011 = 48.044
- H: 10 × 1.008 = 10.080
- O: 3 × 15.999 = 47.997
- N: 1 × 14.007 = 14.007
- P: 1 × 30.974 = 30.974
- S: 1 × 32.06 = 32.06

Total molecular weight = 48.044 + 10.080 + 47.997 + 14.007 + 30.974 + 32.06 = **183.162 g/mol**

### Step 3: Cross-Check with Dataset Patterns
Looking at the dataset, the property values match closely with molecular weights for various compounds. For example:
- **CCCCC** (pentane, C5H12): 72.151 (calculated: 72.15)
- **CCCCBr** (1-bromobutane, C4H9Br): 137.02 (calculated: 137.02)
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** (a pesticide-like structure): 321.549 (consistent with calculated molecular weight)

The slight deviations in the dataset are likely due to rounding or specific isotopic considerations, but the values are very close to molecular weights. Therefore, predicting the property as molecular
==================================================
Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 96.94400000000002
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, which is 1,2-dichloroethene (specifically, a mixture of cis and trans isomers or one of them, as the notation does not specify stereochemistry). The property in question appears to be the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, given the values in the dataset correspond closely to the molecular weights of the respective molecules (e.g., CC1CCCC1 is cyclohexane with a molecular weight of 84.16 g/mol, and CCCC(=O)C is 2-pentanone with a molecular weight of 86.13 g/mol).

To predict the property for Cl\C=C/Cl (1,2-dichloroethene), I will calculate its molecular weight based on the atomic composition:

- The molecule has 2 carbon atoms (C), 2 hydrogen atoms (H), and 2 chlorine atoms (Cl).
- Atomic weights (approximate values used for simplicity, as in the dataset):
  - Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
  - Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
  - Chlorine (Cl): 35.45 g/mol
- Molecular weight calculation:
  - 2 * C = 2 * 12.01 = 24.02
  - 2 * H = 2 * 1.008 = 2.016
  - 2 * Cl = 2 * 35.45 = 70.90
- Total molecular weight = 24.02 + 2.016 + 70.90 = 96.936 g/mol

Rounding to three decimal places, as is consistent with the provided data, the predicted property value (molecular weight) for Cl\C=C/Cl is approximately **96.936**.

To further validate, I note that the dataset includes molecules with chlorine atoms, such as Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl (2,4-dichlorophenol, molecular weight 163.003) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (a polychlorinated biphenyl, molecular weight 360.882), where the values match the molecular weights. Additionally, for smaller halogenated molecules like CCBr (bromoethane, molecular weight 108.966), the value also aligns with the molecular weight. This reinforces that the property is indeed molecular weight.

Thus, my predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl is **96.936**.

Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 79.10199999999998
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I can infer that the property being measured for the molecules is likely the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) in g/mol, as the values correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the given compounds. For example:

- CCCCCCCBr (1-bromoheptane) has a molecular weight of approximately 179.10 g/mol, matching the given value of 179.101.
- ClCC(C)C (1-chloro-2-methylpropane) has a molecular weight of approximately 92.57 g/mol, matching 92.569.
- CC(C)(C)CCO (tert-hexanol) has a molecular weight of approximately 102.18 g/mol, matching 102.177.

This pattern holds across the dataset, confirming that the property in question is molecular weight.

Now, let's predict the molecular weight for the molecule **c1ccncc1**, which represents **pyridine**, a heterocyclic aromatic compound with the formula C₅H₅N.

To calculate the molecular weight:
- Carbon (C): 5 atoms × 12.011 g/mol = 60.055 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 5 atoms × 1.008 g/mol = 5.040 g/mol
- Nitrogen (N): 1 atom × 14.007 g/mol = 14.007 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 60.055 + 5.040 + 14.007 = **79.102 g/mol**

Therefore, the predicted property value (molecular weight) for the molecule **c1ccncc1** (pyridine) is **79.102**.

**Final Answer: 79.102**

Iteration: 59
SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 372.80800000000016
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being referred to is the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values given correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the molecules described by their SMILES strings. For instance, CSC (dimethyl sulfide) has a listed value of 62.137, which matches its molecular weight (C2H6S = 2*12.01 + 6*1.008 + 32.06 = 62.134 g/mol), and similar matches can be observed for other entries.

Therefore, I will predict the molecular weight of the target molecule, given by the SMILES string: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string represents a molecule. Let's break it down into its structural components to calculate the molecular formula:

- **OCC(O)COC(=O)**: This part represents a glycerol-like structure with an ester linkage. It can be interpreted as HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-O-C(=O)-, which corresponds to C3H7O4 (before connecting to the rest of the molecule).
- **c1ccccc1**: This is a benzene ring, C6H6, but since it's connected, we adjust for substitution.
- **Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**: This represents a quinazoline-like structure (a fused bicyclic system with nitrogen atoms) with a chlorine substituent. The "c2...c23" indicates a fused ring system, and "N" indicates nitrogen atoms in the ring. This part can be interpreted as a quinazoline derivative with Cl, roughly C9H6N2Cl (before connections).
- The "N" between the benzene and quinazoline indicates an amine linkage (-NH-).

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
Let's count the atoms by parsing the SMILES string carefully:

- **Carbon atoms**:
  - From OCC(O)COC: 3 carbons (glycerol backbone).
  - From c1ccccc1: 6 carbons (benzene ring).
  - From c2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23: This is a quinazoline system, which has 9 carbons (two fused rings: one 6-membered and one 5-membered with nitrogens).
  - Total carbons = 3 + 6 + 9 = 18.

- **Hydrogen atoms**:
  - From OCC(O)COC: HO-CH2-CH(OH)-CH2-O- contributes 7 hydrogens, but one H is lost due to ester formation with the carbonyl.
  - From c1ccccc1: Benzene normally has 6H, but it has two substitutions (ester and NH), so 4H remain.
  - From Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23: Quinazoline (C9H6N2) has 6H, but with Cl replacing one H and one H lost due to NH linkage, it contributes 4H. The NH linkage itself contributes 1H.
  - Total hydrogens = 6 (from glycerol part, adjusted) + 4 (benzene) + 4 (quinazoline) + 1 (NH) = 15.

- **Oxygen atoms**:
  - From OCC(O)COC(=O): 4 oxygens (two OH, one ether-like O, one from ester C=O).
  - Total oxygens = 4.

- **Nitrogen atoms**:
  - From Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23: 2 nitrogens in quinazoline, plus 1 from NH linkage.
  - Total nitrogens = 3.

- **Chlorine atoms**:
  - From Cl in c3cc(Cl)ccc23: 1 chlorine.
  - Total chlorine = 1.

So, the molecular formula is C18H15N3O4Cl.

### Step 3: Calculate Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights:
- C: 12.01 g/mol × 18 = 216.18
- H: 1.008 g/mol × 15 = 15.12
- N: 14.01 g/mol × 3 = 42.03
- O: 16.00 g/mol × 4 = 64.00
- Cl: 35.45 g/mol × 1 = 35.45

Total molecular weight = 216.18 + 15.12 + 42.03 + 64.00 + 35.45 = 372.78 g/mol.

### Step 4: Cross-Check with Similar Molecules
Looking at the provided dataset, molecules with similar complexity (e.g., multiple rings, halogens, and functional
==================================================
Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 88.14999999999999
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am tasked with predicting a property for the molecule CCCCCO, which is 1-pentanol (a five-carbon chain alcohol). The property values given in the examples appear to correspond to molecular weight (or molar mass) in g/mol, as the values align closely with the calculated molecular weights of the molecules when interpreted via their SMILES notation.

To confirm this hypothesis, let's examine a few examples:
- CCCc1ccccc1 (propylbenzene) has a property value of 120.195, which matches its molecular weight (C9H12 = 120.19 g/mol).
- CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1 (tert-butylbenzene) has a value of 148.249, matching its molecular weight (C10H14 = 148.24 g/mol).
- CSSC (dimethyl disulfide) has a value of 94.204, matching its molecular weight (C2H6S2 = 94.20 g/mol).

Given this pattern, it is reasonable to conclude that the property being predicted is the molecular weight of the molecule.

Now, let's calculate the molecular weight for CCCCCO (1-pentanol, C5H12O):
- Carbon (C): 5 atoms × 12.01 g/mol = 60.05 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 12 atoms × 1.008 g/mol = 12.096 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 1 atom × 16.00 g/mol = 16.00 g/mol
- Total molecular weight = 60.05 + 12.096 + 16.00 = 88.146 g/mol

Rounding to three decimal places, as is common in the provided data, the predicted property value for CCCCCO is approximately 88.146.

To further validate, I can compare this with similar molecules in the dataset:
- CC(C)CC(C)(C)O (a branched alcohol with 6 carbons) has a value of 116.204, which matches its molecular weight (C6H14O = 102.17 g/mol, though this seems slightly off, possibly a typo or different property).
- OC1CCCCCCC1 (cyclooctanol, C8H16O) has a value of 128.215, matching its molecular weight (128.21 g/mol).

Since CCCCCO is a straight-chain alcohol with 5 carbons, its molecular weight should be less than that of longer-chain alcohols, which it is.

Thus, the predicted property value for CCCCCO is **88.146**.
==================================================
Iteration: 61
SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 267.306
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**. The property in question appears to be the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values given in the examples are consistent with molecular weights calculated from the molecular formulas derived from the SMILES notations.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string for the target molecule is **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**. Let's break it down to understand the structure:
- **CC1=**: This indicates a carbon atom (C) connected to a methyl group (C) and part of a ring (denoted by the number 1), with a double bond (=) to the next atom.
- **C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)**: This carbon is connected to a carbonyl group (C(=O)) which is further connected to a nitrogen (N) that is part of an amide bond with a phenyl group (c2ccccc2, a benzene ring).
- **S(=O)(=O)**: This indicates a sulfur atom with two double-bonded oxygen atoms, representing a sulfonyl group (SO₂).
- **CCO1**: This represents a chain of two carbons (CC) connected to an oxygen (O), which closes the ring back to the first carbon (denoted by 1).

From this, the molecule appears to be a cyclic compound, likely a six-membered ring containing sulfur and oxygen (a sultone or similar structure), with a methyl substituent and an amide side chain connected to a phenyl group.

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
To predict the molecular weight, I will deduce the molecular formula by counting the atoms:
- **Carbon (C)**: 
  - From the ring and substituents: CC1=C...CCO1 suggests a six-membered ring with additional carbons. Let's count:
    - CC1 (2 carbons, one in the ring).
    - =C (1 carbon in the ring).
    - C(C(=O)...) (1 carbon in the ring, plus 1 in the carbonyl).
    - c2ccccc2 (6 carbons in the phenyl ring).
    - CC in CCO1 (2 carbons).
  - Total carbons = 2 (from CC1) + 1 (from =C) + 1 (from C in ring) + 1 (from C=O) + 6 (phenyl) + 2 (CC in CCO1) = 13 carbons.
- **Hydrogen (H)**:
  - Methyl group (CC1): 3 H.
  - Phenyl ring (c2ccccc2): 5 H (since one carbon is connected to N).
  - Amide NH: 1 H.
  - CC in CCO1: First C has 2 H, second C has 2 H (since it's connected to O).
  - Total hydrogens = 3 (methyl) + 5 (phenyl) + 1 (NH) + 2 (first C in CC) + 2 (second C in CC) = 13 H.
- **Nitrogen (N)**: 1 N from the amide (Nc2ccccc2).
- **Oxygen (O)**: 
  - 1 O from carbonyl (C(=O)).
  - 2 O from sulfonyl (S(=O)(=O)).
  - 1 O from the ring (CCO1).
  - Total oxygens = 1 + 2 + 1 = 4 O.
- **Sulfur (S)**: 1 S from S(=O)(=O).

Thus, the molecular formula is **C₁₃H₁₃NO₄S**.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded to three decimal places for consistency with the provided data):
- C: 12.011 × 13 = 156.143
- H: 1.008 × 13 = 13.104
- N: 14.007 × 1 = 14.007
- O: 15.999 × 4 = 63.996
- S: 32.06 × 1 = 32.06

Total molecular weight = 156.143 + 13.104 + 14.007 + 63.996 + 32.06 = **279.310**

### Step 4: Cross-Check with Similar Molecules
Looking at the provided examples, molecules with similar functional groups (e.g., sulfonyl, amide, cyclic structures) have molecular weights in a comparable range:
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC

Iteration: 62
SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 346.33900000000017
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am tasked with predicting a property for the molecule with the SMILES notation `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C`. The property values in the examples appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) in g/mol, as the values are consistent with typical molecular weights of organic compounds and match the expected masses for several of the given molecules when calculated mentally.

To predict the property (assumed to be molecular weight) for the target molecule, I will first interpret the SMILES string to understand the molecular structure and then estimate its molecular weight by counting the atoms and functional groups.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string is: `COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C`

Breaking it down:
- `COC(=O)` indicates a methyl ester group (–COOCH₃).
- `C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C` suggests a cyclic structure, likely a six-membered ring with nitrogen (a pyridine or pyrimidine-like structure), substituted with various groups.
- `c2ccccc2` represents a benzene ring.
- `N(=O)=O` indicates a nitro group (–NO₂) attached to the benzene ring.
- Another `C(=O)OC` indicates a second methyl ester group.
- The ring contains a methyl group (`C`) and other substituents as indicated by the SMILES.

From this, I deduce that the molecule is likely a dihydropyridine or similar heterocyclic compound with two ester groups (dimethyl ester), a phenyl ring substituted with a nitro group, and a methyl group on the heterocycle.

### Step 2: Estimate the Molecular Formula
To calculate the molecular weight, I will approximate the number of each type of atom:
- **Carbon (C):** Count the carbons in the SMILES.
  - `COC(=O)`: 2 C (one from methoxy, one from carbonyl).
  - `C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1...` : The ring likely has 5 carbons (C1, =C, C from methyl, and others in the cycle) plus the methyl substituent.
  - `c2ccccc2`: 6 C from the benzene ring.
  - Another `C(=O)OC`: 2 C (carbonyl and methoxy).
  - Additional carbons in the ring structure.
  - Total C ≈ 2 (first ester) + 5 (ring) + 1 (methyl on ring) + 6 (benzene) + 2 (second ester) = ~16–18 C. Let’s assume 17 C for now.
- **Hydrogen (H):** Estimate based on typical valences. The ring is partially unsaturated, and substituents reduce H count. Approximate 10–14 H (will refine later).
- **Oxygen (O):** Count from functional groups.
  - Two ester groups: `C(=O)OC` each has 3 O (2 from carbonyl, 1 from methoxy), but in SMILES, `C(=O)O` is carbonyl and one O, with `C` as methoxy, so each ester is 2 O.
  - Two esters: 4 O.
  - Nitro group `N(=O)=O`: 2 O.
  - Total O = 4 (esters) + 2 (nitro) = 6 O.
- **Nitrogen (N):**
  - One N in the ring (`NC`).
  - One N in the nitro group.
  - Total N = 2.

Approximate formula: C₁₇H₁₂N₂O₆ (H count is a rough guess).

### Step 3: Calculate Molecular Weight
Using atomic masses (C=12, H=1, N=14, O=16):
- C₁₇: 17 × 12 = 204
- H₁₂: 12 × 1 = 12
- N₂: 2 × 14 = 28
- O₆: 6 × 16 = 96
- Total = 204 + 12 + 28 + 96 = 340 g/mol

However, checking the structure, dihydropyridine derivatives like nifedipine (a similar compound) have molecular weights around 300–350 g/mol. Let me adjust the H count. A dihydropyridine ring with substituents often has more hydrogens. Recounting:
- Dihydropyridine base (C₅H₇N) adjusted for substituents.

Iteration: 63
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 154.125
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being predicted is the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the molecules, as the values given correspond closely to the molecular weights of the compounds when calculated from their SMILES strings. For instance, "Clc1cccc(I)c1" corresponds to chloroidobenzene with a molecular weight of approximately 238.455 g/mol, and "CCCCCCCO" corresponds to 1-heptanol with a molecular weight of approximately 116.204 g/mol. Therefore, I will predict the molecular weight for the given molecule.

The molecule in question is represented by the SMILES string "O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2". Let's interpret this structure to determine its molecular formula and calculate its molecular weight.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
- "O=C2" indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) where the carbon is labeled as atom 2.
- "NC(=O)" indicates a nitrogen connected to another carbonyl group.
- "C1(CC1)" indicates a cyclopropane ring (a three-membered carbon ring) where "C1" and "CC1" denote the ring closure.
- "C(=O)N2" indicates another carbonyl group connected to a nitrogen, closing the ring with atom 2.

This SMILES string describes a cyclic molecule, specifically a derivative of barbituric acid or a similar structure. Let's deduce the structure:
- The molecule appears to be a six-membered heterocyclic ring with alternating nitrogen and carbon atoms, where three of the carbons are part of carbonyl groups (C=O), and one carbon is part of a cyclopropane ring (spiro connection).
- The structure is likely 5,5-spirocyclopropane-barbituric acid or a similar compound, where the central ring is a pyrimidine-like structure with three carbonyls at positions 2, 4, and 6, and a spiro cyclopropane at position 5.

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
Let's break down the atoms:
- The barbituric acid core (without substitution) is C4H4N2O3 (four carbons, four hydrogens, two nitrogens, three oxygens).
- In this case, at position 5, instead of two hydrogens, there is a spiro cyclopropane ring. A cyclopropane ring (C3H6) as a spiro substituent replaces the two hydrogens at carbon 5, but since it's spiro, the shared carbon is already counted in the core. So, the cyclopropane adds 2 additional carbons and 4 hydrogens (since the shared carbon is part of the core C4).
- Core structure (barbituric acid-like): C4H2N2O3 (since two H's at position 5 are replaced by the spiro connection).
- Spiro cyclopropane: Adds 2 carbons and 4 hydrogens (the third carbon is the shared one already counted in the core).
- Total: C (4+2) = 6, H (2+4) = 6, N = 2, O = 3.
- Molecular formula: C6H6N2O3.

### Step 3: Calculate Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights:
- Carbon (C): 12.011 g/mol × 6 = 72.066 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol × 6 = 6.048 g/mol
- Nitrogen (N): 14.007 g/mol × 2 = 28.014 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 15.999 g/mol × 3 = 47.997 g/mol
- Total molecular weight = 72.066 + 6.048 + 28.014 + 47.997 = 154.125 g/mol

### Step 4: Cross-Check with Similar Structures
Looking at the provided dataset, molecules with similar complexity (e.g., "C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O" with a molecular weight of 150.13 g/mol, which is glucose or a similar sugar) have molecular weights in a comparable range. The predicted value of 154.125 g/mol seems reasonable for a small heterocyclic compound with a spiro ring.

### Final Prediction
The predicted property (molecular weight) for the molecule "O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2" is approximately **154.125**. Given the precision in the dataset (typically three decimal places), I will round it to **154.125**.

**Predicted Property Value: 154.125**
==================================================
Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 64.515
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being predicted for the molecules is their **molecular weight** (or molar mass) in g/mol. The values given for the example molecules correspond closely to their calculated molecular weights based on their chemical formulas, as derived from their SMILES notations. Therefore, I will predict the molecular weight for the molecule **ClCC**.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES notation for ClCC
The SMILES string "ClCC" represents a molecule with the following structure:
- "Cl" indicates a chlorine atom.
- "C" represents a carbon atom, and since there are two "C"s, there are two carbon atoms connected by a single bond (implied in SMILES for carbon chains unless specified otherwise).
- The first carbon is bonded to the chlorine atom.

Thus, "ClCC" corresponds to the molecule **chloroethane** (C2H5Cl), where the structure is Cl-CH2-CH3.

### Step 2: Calculate the molecular weight
To calculate the molecular weight of ClCC (C2H5Cl), I will use the approximate atomic masses of the constituent atoms:
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
- Chlorine (Cl): 35.45 g/mol

The molecular formula is C2H5Cl, so:
- Carbon: 2 atoms × 12.01 g/mol = 24.02 g/mol
- Hydrogen: 5 atoms × 1.008 g/mol = 5.04 g/mol
- Chlorine: 1 atom × 35.45 g/mol = 35.45 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 24.02 + 5.04 + 35.45 = **64.51 g/mol**

### Step 3: Compare with provided data for consistency
Looking at the provided data, molecules with similar structures have molecular weights close to their calculated values:
- For example, "CCCCC" (pentane, C5H12) has a value of 72.151, which matches its molecular weight (5×12.01 + 12×1.008 = 72.15).
- "Clc1ccccc1" (chlorobenzene, C6H5Cl) has a value of 112.559, which matches its molecular weight (6×12.01 + 5×1.008 + 35.45 = 112.56).

This confirms that the property is indeed molecular weight, and my calculation method is consistent with the data.

### Final Prediction
The predicted property value (molecular weight) for the molecule **ClCC** (C2H5Cl) is **64.51 g/mol**.
==================================================
Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 230.909
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am tasked with predicting a property for the molecule with the SMILES notation `Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`. The property values given in the examples appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they are consistent with the expected molecular weights calculated from the atomic compositions of the molecules. For instance, `ClCC(Cl)Cl` (1,1,2-trichloroethane) has a value of 133.405, which matches its molecular weight (C2H3Cl3: 2*12.01 + 3*1.008 + 3*35.45 = 133.404 g/mol). Similarly, other examples like `CN(=O)=O` (nitromethane, 61.04 g/mol) and `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` (eicosane, 282.556 g/mol) align with their molecular weights. Therefore, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight.

Now, let's analyze the target molecule `Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl`. This SMILES string represents a pyridine ring (a six-membered heterocyclic aromatic ring with nitrogen) substituted with chlorine at one position and a trichloromethyl group (-CCl3) at another position. Let's break it down:

- `c1cccc(n1)` indicates a pyridine ring, where `n1` denotes the nitrogen atom in the ring, and the `c` atoms are carbons. The numbering implies a six-membered ring with nitrogen at position 1.
- `Clc1` indicates a chlorine atom attached to carbon 2 of the pyridine ring (since SMILES notation often lists substituents before the ring atom they are attached to).
- `C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` indicates a carbon atom attached to three chlorine atoms, i.e., a trichloromethyl group (-CCl3), which is attached to another carbon of the pyridine ring, likely position 3 or 6 based on standard SMILES parsing (though exact position isn't critical for molecular weight calculation).

So, the molecule is a chloropyridine with a trichloromethyl substituent. Let's determine its molecular formula:

- Pyridine base structure: C5H5N (5 carbons, 5 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen).
- One chlorine substituent replaces one hydrogen on the ring: subtract 1 H, add 1 Cl.
- Trichloromethyl group (-CCl3) adds 1 carbon and 3 chlorines, replacing another hydrogen on the ring: subtract 1 H, add 1 C and 3 Cl.

Thus, the molecular formula is:
- Carbons: 5 (from pyridine) + 1 (from -CCl3) = 6
- Hydrogens: 5 (from pyridine) - 1 (for Cl substituent) - 1 (for -CCl3 substituent) = 3
- Nitrogen: 1
- Chlorines: 1 (on ring) + 3 (from -CCl3) = 4

Molecular formula: C6H3NCl4

Now, calculate the molecular weight:
- Carbon: 6 * 12.01 = 72.06
- Hydrogen: 3 * 1.008 = 3.024
- Nitrogen: 1 * 14.007 = 14.007
- Chlorine: 4 * 35.45 = 141.8

Total molecular weight = 72.06 + 3.024 + 14.007 + 141.8 = 230.891 g/mol

To refine the prediction, I can compare this molecule to similar ones in the dataset. For example:
- `ClCC(Cl)Cl` (C2H3Cl3, 133.405 g/mol) has three chlorines but fewer carbons.
- `Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl` (a larger molecule with multiple chlorines, 354.491 g/mol) is much heavier due to additional rings.
- `ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O` (349.066 g/mol) also has four chlorines but includes additional functional groups.

My calculated value of approximately 230.9 g/mol seems reasonable for a pyridine ring with four chlorines. A close analog in the dataset is `Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (C12H7Cl3, 257.547 g/mol), which has three chlorines and more carbons, suggesting my value is plausible since C6H3NCl4 should be lighter due to fewer carbons but heavier due to an extra chlorine.

I will round the molecular weight to three decimal places,
==================================================
Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: 102.17699999999998
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I will predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCC(C)O**, which is 2-hexanol (a six-carbon alcohol with the hydroxyl group on the second carbon). The property in question appears to be the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values given in the examples closely match the calculated molecular weights of the respective molecules. For instance:

- **CCCC1CCCC1** (methylcyclopentane) has a value of 112.216, which matches its molecular weight (C7H14 = 98 + 14 = 112.22 g/mol).
- **Cc1ccccc1** (toluene) has a value of 92.141, matching its molecular weight (C7H8 = 92.14 g/mol).
- **CC(O)c1ccccc1** (1-phenylethanol) has a value of 122.167, matching its molecular weight (C8H10O = 122.16 g/mol).

Thus, the property seems to be the molecular weight in g/mol, rounded to three decimal places in most cases.

Now, let's calculate the molecular weight of **CCCCC(C)O** (2-hexanol):
- The molecular formula is C6H14O.
- Carbon (C): 6 atoms × 12.011 = 72.066 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 14 atoms × 1.008 = 14.112 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 1 atom × 15.999 = 15.999 g/mol
- Total = 72.066 + 14.112 + 15.999 = 102.177 g/mol

To confirm this prediction, I can compare it with similar molecules in the dataset:
- **CCC(C)CCO** (2-methyl-1-pentanol, C6H14O) has a value of 102.177, which matches the molecular weight of a C6H14O isomer.
- **CCC(CC)CO** (3-methyl-1-pentanol, also C6H14O) has the same value of 102.177.

Since 2-hexanol is also a C6H14O isomer, its molecular weight should be identical to these compounds. Therefore, the predicted property value for **CCCCC(C)O** is **102.177**.

**Final Answer: 102.177**
==================================================
Iteration: 67
SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 235.906
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being measured for the molecules is likely their **molecular weight** (or molar mass) in g/mol, as the values correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the compounds when interpreted from their SMILES notation. For example:

- ClCCl (dichloroethylene) has a value of 84.933, which matches the approximate molecular weight of C2H2Cl2 (2*12 + 2*1 + 2*35.5 = 96, though the exact value suggests a typo or rounding).
- c1ccccc1SC (thiophenol with a methyl group) has a value of 124.208, close to C7H8S (7*12 + 8*1 + 32 = 124).
- ClC(Cl)Cl (chloroform) has a value of 119.378, matching CHCl3 (12 + 1 + 3*35.5 = 119.5).

Given this, I will assume the property is molecular weight and predict the value for the molecule **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1**, which represents 1,4-dibromobenzene (C6H4Br2).

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES notation
- **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** indicates a benzene ring (c1...c1) with bromine (Br) atoms attached at positions 1 and 4 (para positions).

### Step 2: Determine the molecular formula
- Benzene ring: C6H6
- Replace two hydrogens with two bromines at positions 1 and 4: C6H4Br2

### Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight
- Carbon (C): 6 atoms * 12.01 g/mol = 72.06 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms * 1.008 g/mol = 4.032 g/mol
- Bromine (Br): 2 atoms * 79.90 g/mol = 159.80 g/mol
- Total molecular weight = 72.06 + 4.032 + 159.80 = **235.892 g/mol**

### Step 4: Compare with similar molecules in the dataset
To validate, I can compare with similar halogenated benzenes in the provided list:
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl** (4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl) has a value of 223.102, which is close to the molecular weight of C12H8Cl2 (12*12 + 8*1 + 2*35.5 = 223).
- **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2** (tetrachlorinated diphenyl) has a value of 320.046, matching C14H8Cl4 (14*12 + 8*1 + 4*35.5 = 318, close enough).
- For dibromobenzene, no direct analog is present, but scaling from dichlorobenzene (e.g., adjusting for Br vs. Cl mass difference) supports the calculation.

### Final Prediction
Based on the molecular weight calculation for C6H4Br2, the predicted property value for **Brc1ccc(Br)cc1** is approximately **235.892**. Rounding to three decimal places as per the format of the provided data, the value is **235.892**.

**Predicted Property Value: 235.892**
==================================================
Iteration: 68
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 360.88200000000006
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I can infer that the property being predicted is likely the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) of the molecules, as the values given correspond closely to the molecular weights of the compounds when calculated based on their SMILES notation or structural formulas. Molecular weight is a fundamental property in chemistry, calculated as the sum of the atomic weights of all atoms in a molecule, and the provided values match this interpretation (e.g., ClC(Br)Br corresponds to CClBr2 with a molecular weight of approximately 208.28 g/mol).

Now, let's predict the molecular weight for the target molecule with the SMILES notation: **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl**.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string represents a biphenyl-like structure (two benzene rings connected by a single bond) with chlorine (Cl) substituents. Let's break it down:
- `c1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)` represents the first benzene ring with chlorine atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6 (assuming standard numbering, though SMILES doesn't specify exact positions directly without further context).
- `c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl` represents the second benzene ring with chlorine atoms at positions 2', 4', and 6' (again, inferred).
- The connection between the rings is at the carbon atoms not explicitly substituted in the SMILES notation.

This molecule is a biphenyl with a total of 6 chlorine atoms (3 on each ring).

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
- **Carbon atoms**: Each benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms, and since it's a biphenyl, there are 12 carbon atoms in total (C12).
- **Hydrogen atoms**: In an unsubstituted biphenyl (C12H10), there are 10 hydrogens. Each chlorine atom replaces one hydrogen atom. With 6 chlorine atoms, 6 hydrogens are replaced, leaving 10 - 6 = 4 hydrogens (H4).
- **Chlorine atoms**: There are 6 chlorine atoms (Cl6).

Thus, the molecular formula is **C12H4Cl6**.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded to common values for simplicity, as the provided data seems to use such approximations):
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
- Chlorine (Cl): 35.45 g/mol

Now, calculate:
- Carbon: 12 × 12.01 = 144.12 g/mol
- Hydrogen: 4 × 1.008 = 4.032 g/mol
- Chlorine: 6 × 35.45 = 212.7 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 144.12 + 4.032 + 212.7 = **360.852 g/mol**

### Step 4: Compare with Similar Molecules in the Dataset
To validate, let's compare with a similar molecule from the provided list:
- The molecule `Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` has a molecular formula of C12Cl10 (decachlorobiphenyl) with a molecular weight of 498.662 g/mol. This matches a calculation of 12*12.01 + 10*35.45 ≈ 144.12 + 354.5 = 498.62 g/mol.
- My target molecule has 6 chlorines instead of 10, so the difference should be approximately 4*35.45 = 141.8 g/mol less, plus 4 hydrogens added (4*1.008 ≈ 4 g/mol). So, 498.662 - 141.8 + 4 ≈ 360.86 g/mol, which matches my calculation.

### Final Prediction
Based on the molecular formula C12H4Cl6 and the calculated molecular weight, I predict the property value (molecular weight) for the molecule **Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl** to be approximately **360.85 g/mol**. Rounding to match the precision of the provided data, I will report it as **360.852**.

**Predicted Property Value: 360.852**

Iteration: 69
SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 368.3690000000001
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being predicted for each molecule is the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) in g/mol. The values given for the example molecules correspond closely to their calculated molecular weights based on their chemical formulas derived from the SMILES notation.

Let's analyze the molecule in question: **Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1**

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string represents a molecule with a central phosphate group (OP(=O)) connected to three aromatic rings, each with methyl (C) substituents. Breaking it down:
- **Cc1ccc(...)** indicates a benzene ring with a methyl group (C) at position 1 and a substituent at position 4.
- **OP(=O)** indicates a phosphate group with a double-bonded oxygen.
- **Oc2cccc(C)c2** indicates a second benzene ring with a methyl group and an oxygen attachment.
- **Oc3ccccc3C** indicates a third benzene ring with a methyl group and an oxygen attachment.

This molecule is a triaryl phosphate ester with methyl-substituted phenyl groups, likely a variant of tricresyl phosphate (TCP), where the three phenyl rings have methyl groups (cresyl groups).

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
Let's deduce the molecular formula by counting the atoms:
- **Central phosphate group**: P(=O), so 1 P and 1 O (double-bonded), plus 3 O atoms connected to the aryl groups, totaling 4 O atoms and 1 P.
- **Three aryl groups**: Each is a cresyl group (methylphenyl), which is C6H4(CH3), but in SMILES, the oxygen is part of the connection (Oc1ccc...).
  - Each cresyl group connected via oxygen: C6H4(CH3), but since it's connected via O, we consider the ring as C6H5 minus one H for the connection, plus CH3, so C7H7 per ring, but adjusted for substitution.
  - In SMILES, **Cc1ccc(O...)** means a benzene ring (C6) with a methyl (C, so +1 C and 3 H) and an oxygen substituent, but the hydrogen count adjusts based on substitution.
  - Each ring is a toluene-like structure (C7H8), but one H is replaced by the O connection, so effectively C7H7 per phenyl ring for counting.

- **Ring 1**: Cc1ccc(O...)cc1 → Methylbenzene with O at para position → C7H7 (since one H is replaced by O).
- **Ring 2**: Oc2cccc(C)c2 → Methylbenzene with O at position 1 and methyl at position 2 or 3 → C7H7.
- **Ring 3**: Oc3ccccc3C → Methylbenzene with O and methyl → C7H7.

Total carbons from rings: 3 × 7 = 21 C
Total hydrogens from rings: 3 × 7 = 21 H
Phosphate group: P, 4 O (1 double-bonded, 3 single-bonded to rings)
So, molecular formula: C21H21O4P

### Step 3: Calculate Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (approximate values since no external tools are used):
- C: 12.01 g/mol × 21 = 252.21
- H: 1.008 g/mol × 21 = 21.168
- O: 16.00 g/mol × 4 = 64.00
- P: 30.97 g/mol × 1 = 30.97

Total molecular weight = 252.21 + 21.168 + 64.00 + 30.97 ≈ 368.34 g/mol

### Step 4: Compare with Similar Molecules
Looking at the provided dataset, molecules with similar structures (e.g., triaryl phosphates or compounds with multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms) have molecular weights in a comparable range. For instance:
- **COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** has a molecular weight of 345.653, which includes two methoxyphenyl rings and a trichloro group.
- My predicted molecule has three methylphenyl rings and a phosphate group, so a slightly higher molecular weight seems reasonable.

### Final Prediction
Based on the calculation and structural analogy, the predicted property (molecular weight) for the molecule **Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1** is approximately **368.4 g/mol**.

**Predicted Property Value: 368.4**

Iteration: 70
SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 312.118
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being predicted is the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the molecules, as the values given correspond closely to the molecular weights of the compounds when calculated manually. The units seem to be in g/mol, and the values match the expected molecular weights for the given SMILES strings.

Now, let's predict the molecular weight for the target molecule with the SMILES string: **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string represents the molecular structure. Let's break it down:
- **FC(F)(F)**: This indicates a trifluoromethyl group (-CF₃), with one carbon and three fluorine atoms.
- **c1cccc(c1)**: This represents a benzene ring (C₆H₅-), where one carbon is substituted.
- **N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**: This describes a lactam ring (a cyclic amide). Specifically:
  - **N2**: Nitrogen atom, part of a ring (labeled as 2 for ring closure).
  - **CC(CCl)**: Two carbons in the ring, one of which has a -CH₂Cl group attached.
  - **C(Cl)**: Another carbon in the ring with a chlorine atom attached.
  - **C2=O**: The carbon connected back to N2 (closing the ring) and double-bonded to oxygen, indicating a carbonyl group.
- The benzene ring is connected to the nitrogen of the lactam ring, and the trifluoromethyl group is attached to the benzene ring.

So, the molecule is a benzene ring substituted with a trifluoromethyl group (-CF₃) and a lactam ring (a 5-membered ring with a nitrogen and a carbonyl), where the lactam ring has two chlorine atoms attached to different carbons.

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
Let's count the atoms:
- **Carbon (C)**:
  - Benzene ring: 6 carbons.
  - Trifluoromethyl group: 1 carbon.
  - Lactam ring: 3 carbons (from CC and C in the ring).
  - Total C = 6 + 1 + 3 = 10.
- **Hydrogen (H)**:
  - Benzene ring: Normally 6H, but two positions are substituted (by -CF₃ and the lactam nitrogen), so 6 - 2 = 4H.
  - Lactam ring: Let's analyze the structure:
    - N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O suggests a 5-membered ring: N-C-C-C-C(=O)-N (but since it's a lactam, it's N connected to C=O).
    - Standard lactam (like pyrrolidinone) has a 5-membered ring with formula C₄H₇NO, but here two hydrogens are replaced by Cl and CH₂Cl.
    - Ring carbons: First C (connected to N) has 2H (CH₂), second C has 1H and CH₂Cl (so CH-CH₂Cl), third C has 1H and Cl (CHCl).
    - Hydrogens in lactam ring: 2 (from first C) + 1 (from second C) + 1 (from third C) + 2 (from CH₂Cl) = 6H.
  - Total H = 4 (benzene) + 6 (lactam and side chain) = 10H.
- **Fluorine (F)**: 3 (from -CF₃).
- **Nitrogen (N)**: 1 (from lactam ring).
- **Oxygen (O)**: 1 (from carbonyl in lactam).
- **Chlorine (Cl)**: 2 (one on the ring as C(Cl), one in CH₂Cl as CCl).

Molecular formula: **C₁₀H₁₀F₃N₁O₁Cl₂**.

### Step 3: Calculate Molecular Weight
Using approximate atomic weights (commonly used in chemistry for quick calculations):
- C: 12 g/mol
- H: 1 g/mol
- F: 19 g/mol
- N: 14 g/mol
- O: 16 g/mol
- Cl: 35.5 g/mol

Molecular weight = (10 × 12) + (10 × 1) + (3 × 19) + (1 × 14) + (1 × 16) + (2 × 35.5)
= 120 + 10 + 57 + 14 + 16 + 71
= 288 g/mol.

### Step 4: Refine and Verify
I notice that in the provided dataset, molecular weights are given with three decimal
==================================================
Iteration: 71
SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 153.13699999999997
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I can infer that the property being predicted is likely the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values given correspond closely to the molecular weights of the molecules listed (in g/mol). The molecular weight is a fundamental property of a molecule, calculated by summing the atomic weights of all atoms in the molecule.

Let's analyze the target molecule, **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O**, which can be interpreted as a benzene ring substituted with a methoxy group (OCH3) and a nitro group (NO2). This corresponds to the chemical formula **C7H7NO3** (7 carbons, 7 hydrogens, 1 nitrogen, 3 oxygens).

To predict the molecular weight, I will calculate it based on the atomic weights of the constituent atoms (using approximate standard values):
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol

Now, calculate the molecular weight of **C7H7NO3**:
- Carbon: 7 × 12.01 = 84.07 g/mol
- Hydrogen: 7 × 1.008 = 7.056 g/mol
- Nitrogen: 1 × 14.01 = 14.01 g/mol
- Oxygen: 3 × 16.00 = 48.00 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 84.07 + 7.056 + 14.01 + 48.00 = **153.136 g/mol**

To confirm the reasonableness of this prediction, I can compare it to similar molecules in the provided dataset:
- **c1ccccc1O** (phenol, C6H6O): 94.113 g/mol
- **O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O** (dinitrobenzene, C6H4N2O4): 168.108 g/mol
- My predicted molecule (methoxynitrobenzene, C7H7NO3) should have a molecular weight between phenol (one substituent) and dinitrobenzene (two nitro groups), as it has a methoxy group (lighter than nitro) and one nitro group. A value of approximately 153 g/mol fits logically.

Thus, the predicted property value (molecular weight) for the molecule **COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** is approximately **153.14 g/mol**. For consistency with the precision in the provided data, I will round it to three decimal places as seen in most examples.

**Final Predicted Value: 153.136**

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 409.7819999999999
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I can infer that the property being described in the examples is likely the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) of the molecules, given in grams per mole (g/mol). The values provided match closely with the calculated molecular weights of the compounds when considering their SMILES notations and corresponding atomic compositions. Therefore, I will predict the molecular weight for the given molecule.

The molecule in question is represented by the SMILES string: `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl`. Let's break down this structure to determine its molecular formula and calculate its molecular weight.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string describes a complex polycyclic structure with multiple chlorine (Cl) atoms. Let's analyze it:
- `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)` indicates a cyclic structure (likely a cyclohexane-like ring) with two chlorine atoms attached to carbons labeled as 1.
- `C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` suggests additional rings or bridges (C2 and C3 indicate ring closures), a double bond (`=C(Cl)`), and several more chlorine atoms attached to various carbons.

This structure appears to be a highly chlorinated polycyclic hydrocarbon, possibly resembling a derivative of norbornane or a similar bicyclic system with a double bond and multiple chlorine substitutions. Counting the explicit chlorine atoms in the SMILES string, there are 8 Cl atoms mentioned.

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
From the SMILES string, I interpret the structure as follows:
- **Carbon atoms**: The string suggests a bicyclic or tricyclic structure. Counting the carbon atoms based on the ring notations (C1, C2, C3, and connections), there are likely 9 carbon atoms (based on a typical norbornene-like structure with additional carbons for the double bond and bridges).
- **Hydrogen atoms**: In a hydrocarbon of this type, the number of hydrogens is reduced due to ring closures, the double bond, and chlorine substitutions. A base norbornene structure (C7H10) adjusted for additional carbons and heavy chlorination suggests very few hydrogens remain. Given 8 Cl atoms and a double bond, most carbons are likely saturated with Cl or involved in rings, leaving perhaps 2-4 hydrogens.
- **Chlorine atoms**: There are 8 Cl atoms explicitly shown in the SMILES string.

A reasonable molecular formula for this structure, after careful consideration, is likely **C9H4Cl8**. This accounts for a bicyclic structure with a double bond (reducing H count), ring closures, and 8 chlorine substitutions replacing hydrogens.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights:
- Carbon (C): 12.011 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
- Chlorine (Cl): 35.453 g/mol

For C9H4Cl8:
- Carbon: 9 × 12.011 = 108.099 g/mol
- Hydrogen: 4 × 1.008 = 4.032 g/mol
- Chlorine: 8 × 35.453 = 283.624 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 108.099 + 4.032 + 283.624 = **395.755 g/mol**

### Step 4: Cross-Check with Similar Molecules
Looking at the provided examples, highly chlorinated molecules like `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (hexachlorocyclohexane, C6H6Cl6) have a molecular weight of 290.832 g/mol, which matches 6C + 6H + 6Cl. My predicted formula for the target molecule (C9H4Cl8) has more carbons and chlorines, so a higher molecular weight of around 395 g/mol seems plausible.

### Final Prediction
Based on this analysis, I predict the property (molecular weight) for the molecule `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` to be approximately **395.8 g/mol**.

**Predicted Property Value: 395.8**

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 88.10599999999998
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am tasked with predicting a property for the molecule CCCOC=O, which, interpreting the SMILES-like notation, likely represents propyl formate (CH3CH2CH2OC=O, or more accurately, CH3CH2CH2OC(O)H). The property values given in the examples appear to correspond to molecular weights (in g/mol), as they closely match the calculated molar masses of the molecules when rounded appropriately. For instance:

- C1CCCCCC1 (cycloheptane) has a property value of 98.189, which matches its molecular weight (C7H14 = 98.19 g/mol).
- CC#N (acetonitrile) has a property value of 41.053, matching its molecular weight (C2H3N = 41.05 g/mol).
- Clc1ccccc1Cl (1,2-dichlorobenzene) has a property value of 147.004, matching its molecular weight (C6H4Cl2 = 147.00 g/mol).

Thus, I conclude that the property being predicted is the molecular weight (molar mass) of the molecule.

Now, let's calculate the molecular weight of CCCOC=O, interpreted as propyl formate (CH3CH2CH2OC(O)H):

- Carbon (C): 4 atoms × 12.01 g/mol = 48.04 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 8 atoms × 1.008 g/mol = 8.064 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 2 atoms × 16.00 g/mol = 32.00 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 48.04 + 8.064 + 32.00 = 88.104 g/mol

Rounding to three decimal places, as is common in the provided data, the predicted property value is **88.104**.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC=O is **88.104**.

Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 200.322
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being described for each molecule is the molecular weight (or molar mass) in grams per mole (g/mol). The values given for the molecules correspond closely to their calculated molecular weights based on their chemical formulas derived from the SMILES notation. Therefore, I will predict the molecular weight for the given molecule, CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, using my knowledge of chemistry and molecular structures.

Let's break down the SMILES string CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC to determine the molecular formula:

- The string "CCCCCCCCCC" represents a chain of 10 carbon atoms (a decane backbone).
- The "(=O)" indicates a double-bonded oxygen, which, in this context, is part of a carbonyl group (C=O), suggesting an ester or carboxylic acid derivative.
- The "OCC" indicates an oxygen atom followed by two carbon atoms, likely an ethoxy group (-O-CH2-CH3) in the context of an ester.

Interpreting the SMILES string as a whole, CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC represents an ester where the acyl chain is derived from a 10-carbon fatty acid (decanoic acid) and the alcohol part is ethanol. Thus, the molecule is ethyl decanoate.

Now, let's calculate the molecular formula:
- The decanoate part (from decanoic acid, C10H20O2, but in ester form, it loses one H and combines with the alcohol): C10H19O (acyl part).
- The ethoxy part (from ethanol, C2H5OH, but in ester form, it loses one H): C2H5O.
- Combining them, the ester is C10H19O-C2H5O, which simplifies to C12H24O2.

Now, calculate the molecular weight:
- Carbon (C): 12 atoms × 12.011 g/mol = 144.132 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 24 atoms × 1.008 g/mol = 24.192 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 2 atoms × 15.999 g/mol = 31.998 g/mol
- Total molecular weight = 144.132 + 24.192 + 31.998 = 200.322 g/mol

To confirm, let's compare this with similar molecules in the dataset to ensure the prediction aligns with the pattern:
- For example, CCCOC (which is likely butyl methyl ether, C5H12O) has a value of 74.123 g/mol, close to its calculated molecular weight of 88.15 g/mol (note: there might be a discrepancy or typo in interpretation, but most values in the dataset match molecular weights).
- Another example, CCOc1ccccc1 (ethoxybenzene, C8H10O), has a value of 122.167 g/mol, which matches its molecular weight.
- CCOC(=O)CCN(...) and other esters in the list also have values corresponding to their molecular weights.

Given that most of the provided values match the molecular weights of the respective molecules, I am confident that the property is molecular weight. For CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, interpreted as ethyl decanoate (C12H24O2), the calculated molecular weight is approximately 200.32 g/mol.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is **200.32**.

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 327.1230000000001
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O`. Since the property values in the dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (given the context of the numbers and the molecular formulas), I will assume the property being predicted is the molecular weight (in g/mol). I will analyze the structure of the target molecule and compare it to similar molecules in the dataset to make an informed prediction.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O` describes a molecule with the following structural features:
- A phenolic ring (benzene ring with an -OH group, denoted as `O` attached to `c1`).
- A chlorine atom (`Cl`) on the same ring.
- A carbonyl group (`C(=O)`) attached to the ring, forming an amide bond (`Nc2`) with a second benzene ring.
- The second benzene ring has a chlorine atom (`Cl`) and a nitro group (`N(=O)=O`).

Breaking it down:
- First ring: Phenol with Cl substituent and a carbonyl group.
- Linkage: Amide bond (`C(=O)N`) connecting to the second ring.
- Second ring: Benzene with Cl and NO₂ substituents.

This molecule is likely a chlorinated phenolic amide with a nitro-substituted aniline moiety.

### Step 2: Estimate Molecular Weight
To predict the molecular weight, I will calculate it based on the atomic composition derived from the SMILES string.

- **Carbon (C)**: Count the carbons in the two benzene rings and the carbonyl.
  - First ring: 6 carbons (benzene).
  - Second ring: 6 carbons (benzene).
  - Carbonyl carbon: 1 carbon.
  - Total C = 13.
- **Hydrogen (H)**: Count hydrogens on the rings, accounting for substituents.
  - First ring (phenol with Cl and C(=O)N): Normally 6H in benzene, but -OH replaces 1H, Cl replaces 1H, and C(=O)N replaces 1H, so 3H remain.
  - Second ring (with Cl and NO₂ and NH): Normally 6H, but Cl replaces 1H, NO₂ replaces 1H, and NH (amide) replaces 1H, so 3H remain.
  - Amide NH: 1H.
  - Total H = 3 (first ring) + 3 (second ring) + 1 (amide) = 7.
- **Oxygen (O)**: Count oxygen atoms.
  - Phenolic OH: 1O.
  - Carbonyl (C=O): 1O.
  - Nitro group (NO₂): 2O.
  - Total O = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.
- **Nitrogen (N)**: Count nitrogen atoms.
  - Amide N: 1N.
  - Nitro group N: 1N.
  - Total N = 2.
- **Chlorine (Cl)**: Two Cl atoms (one on each ring).
  - Total Cl = 2.

Now, calculate the molecular weight using approximate atomic masses:
- C: 12 g/mol → 13 * 12 = 156
- H: 1 g/mol → 7 * 1 = 7
- O: 16 g/mol → 4 * 16 = 64
- N: 14 g/mol → 2 * 14 = 28
- Cl: 35.5 g/mol → 2 * 35.5 = 71

Total molecular weight = 156 + 7 + 64 + 28 + 71 = 326 g/mol.

### Step 3: Compare with Similar Molecules in the Dataset
To refine the prediction, I will compare the target molecule to structurally similar molecules in the provided dataset, focusing on those with phenolic, amide, nitro, and chlorinated features.

- **Oc1ccc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl (289.545)**: This molecule has two chlorinated phenolic rings connected by an ether linkage. It lacks the amide and nitro group but has three Cl atoms. Its molecular weight is lower than expected for our molecule due to fewer heavy atoms (N and O).
- **Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (157.556)**: This is chloronitrobenzene, a single ring with Cl and NO₂. It is much smaller than our molecule, which has two rings and additional functional groups.
- **CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)

Iteration: 76
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 466.47900000000016
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1**. The property values in the given dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (in g/mol), as they align closely with the calculated molar masses of the molecules when considering standard atomic weights (e.g., C=12, H=1, O=16, Cl=35.5, etc.). For instance, benzene (c1ccccc1) has a value of 78.114, which matches its molecular weight (C6H6 = 6*12 + 6*1 = 78). Similarly, other molecules like CCCCC=C (hexene, C6H12 = 84.162) and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl (1,2,3-trichlorobenzene, C6H3Cl3 = 181.449) confirm this trend. Therefore, I will assume the property is molecular weight and calculate it for the given molecule.

Let's break down the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1** to determine its molecular formula:

1. **Central structure**: The molecule appears to be a symmetrical compound with two phenyl rings (c1ccccc1) connected by a sulfur atom (S), and each phenyl ring is substituted with a thiophosphate group (OP(=S)(OC)OC). The notation suggests:
   - "c1ccc(Sc2ccc(...))cc1" indicates two benzene rings (C6H5) linked via sulfur (S), with substitutions at the para positions.
   - Each benzene ring has an -O-P(=S)(OC)(OC) group attached, where P is phosphorus, S is sulfur (double-bonded to P), and OC represents methoxy groups (-OCH3).

2. **Molecular formula calculation**:
   - **Benzene rings**: Two rings contribute 2 * C6H5. However, since each ring is substituted at one position, we account for the loss of one H per ring. So, 2 * (C6H5) = C12H10.
   - **Sulfur linker**: One S atom between the rings.
   - **Thiophosphate groups**: Two groups of OP(=S)(OC)(OC), which can be written as O-P(=S)(-OCH3)(-OCH3). Each group contributes:
     - P: 1
     - S: 1 (double-bonded)
     - O: 3 (one in =O or -O- linkage to phenyl, two in -OCH3)
     - C: 2 (from two -OCH3)
     - H: 6 (from two -OCH3)
     So, per group: P1 S1 O3 C2 H6. For two groups: P2 S2 O6 C4 H12.
   - **Linkage oxygen**: The oxygen connecting P to the phenyl ring is already counted in the thiophosphate group as part of O3.

   Total molecular formula:
   - C: 12 (from two benzene rings) + 4 (from four -OCH3) = 16
   - H: 10 (from two benzene rings, adjusted for substitution) + 12 (from four -OCH3) = 22
   - O: 6 (from two thiophosphate groups)
   - P: 2 (from two thiophosphate groups)
   - S: 1 (linker) + 2 (from two thiophosphate groups) = 3

   Thus, the molecular formula is **C16H22O6P2S3**.

3. **Molecular weight calculation**:
   Using approximate atomic weights (C=12, H=1, O=16, P=31, S=32):
   - C16: 16 * 12 = 192
   - H22: 22 * 1 = 22
   - O6: 6 * 16 = 96
   - P2: 2 * 31 = 62
   - S3: 3 * 32 = 96
   Total = 192 + 22 + 96 + 62 + 96 = **468 g/mol**

4. **Verification with similar structures**:
   Looking at the dataset, a related molecule **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a property value of 367.86, which matches its approximate molecular weight (C12H16ClNO3PS2). My calculated value for the target molecule (468) is reasonable given the larger structure with two thiophosphate groups
==================================================
Iteration: 77
SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 139.11
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I can infer that the property being described is likely the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, given the numerical values associated with each molecule and their correspondence to the approximate molecular weights of the structures.

Let's analyze the given molecule for which the property needs to be predicted: **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O**. This SMILES notation represents a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a nitro group (-NO2) as substituents. Breaking it down:

- "c1cccc(c1)" indicates a benzene ring (C6H6, but hydrogens are adjusted based on substituents).
- "O" attached to "c1" indicates a hydroxyl group (-OH) on the first carbon.
- "N(=O)=O" attached to another carbon indicates a nitro group (-NO2).

This molecule is therefore **nitrophenol**, likely ortho-nitrophenol based on the SMILES structure (though the exact position might vary, it does not affect molecular weight). Now, let's calculate its molecular weight:

- Carbon (C): 6 atoms × 12.01 = 72.06
- Hydrogen (H): 5 atoms × 1.008 = 5.04 (benzene has 6 hydrogens, but one is replaced by -OH and one by -NO2, so 4 remain, plus 1 from -OH)
- Oxygen (O): 3 atoms × 16.00 = 48.00 (1 from -OH, 2 from -NO2)
- Nitrogen (N): 1 atom × 14.01 = 14.01

Total molecular weight = 72.06 + 5.04 + 48.00 + 14.01 = **139.11**

To confirm this reasoning, I note that in the provided dataset, there is a molecule **Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O** (nitrotoluene) with a property value of 137.138, which is very close to its molecular weight (C7H7NO2 = 137.14). The difference between nitrotoluene and nitrophenol is essentially the replacement of a methyl group (-CH3, 15.03) with a hydroxyl group (-OH, 17.01), which adds about 2 units to the molecular weight, aligning with my calculation of 139.11 for nitrophenol.

Therefore, the predicted property value for **Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O** is approximately **139.11**.

**Final Answer: 139.11**

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 504.4380000000001
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the given molecule, which appears to be a complex carbohydrate or oligosaccharide. The property values in the training data seem to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they align closely with the calculated molecular weights of the molecules when interpreted through their SMILES notation.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string for the molecule is:  
`OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O`

This string represents a complex sugar molecule, likely a trisaccharide or a derivative of sucrose with additional sugar units. Breaking it down:
- The structure contains multiple cyclic sugar units (indicated by numbers like 1, 2, 3 in the SMILES, which denote ring closures).
- There are multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups and ether linkages (-O-), typical of carbohydrates.
- The presence of "CO" and "OC" suggests alcohol groups and glycosidic bonds between sugar units.

This molecule appears to be a structure similar to raffinose or a related oligosaccharide, which consists of galactose, glucose, and fructose units linked together.

### Step 2: Estimate the Molecular Formula
To predict the molecular weight, I will estimate the molecular formula by counting the atoms based on the SMILES string:
- **Carbon (C)**: Each "C" in the SMILES represents a carbon atom. Counting the explicit "C" characters and considering the ring structures, there are approximately 17-18 carbon atoms (based on typical trisaccharide structures like raffinose, which has 17 carbons).
- **Oxygen (O)**: Each "O" represents an oxygen atom, often in hydroxyl groups or ether linkages. There are many "O" characters, suggesting around 12-14 oxygen atoms.
- **Hydrogen (H)**: Hydrogens are implied in SMILES for carbons that are not fully bonded. For a carbohydrate, the general formula is often close to Cn(H2O)n, but with adjustments for ring closures and linkages. I estimate around 30-34 hydrogens.

A reasonable molecular formula for a trisaccharide like raffinose is C18H32O16.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using the approximate molecular formula C18H32O16, I calculate the molecular weight:
- Carbon: 18 atoms × 12.01 g/mol = 216.18
- Hydrogen: 32 atoms × 1.008 g/mol = 32.256
- Oxygen: 16 atoms × 16.00 g/mol = 256.00
- Total = 216.18 + 32.256 + 256.00 = 504.436 g/mol

### Step 4: Compare with Training Data
Looking at the training data, the property values range from small molecules like CBr (94.939) to larger molecules like COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 (466.479). A trisaccharide with a molecular weight around 504 is plausible for a larger, complex molecule, as it exceeds the values of smaller organic compounds in the dataset.

### Step 5: Refine the Prediction
Raffinose, a common trisaccharide, has the exact formula C18H32O16 and a molecular weight of 504.437 g/mol, which matches my calculation. Given the complexity of the SMILES string and the presence of multiple sugar units, I am confident that the molecule is indeed a trisaccharide like raffinose or a very close analog.

### Final Prediction
The predicted property value (molecular weight) for the molecule `OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O` is **504.437**.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 54.09199999999999
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am tasked with predicting a property for the molecule CCC#C, which is propyne (CH3-C≡CH), using the examples given. The property values listed alongside the molecules appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) in g/mol, as they align closely with the calculated molecular weights of the compounds when considering their molecular formulas derived from the SMILES notation.

To confirm this hypothesis, let's examine a few examples:
- For CC1=C(CCCO1)C(=O)Nc2ccccc2, the molecular formula is C13H15NO2, and the calculated molecular weight is approximately 217.26 g/mol, matching the given value of 217.268.
- For N#Cc1ccccc1C#N (terephthalonitrile, C8H4N2), the molecular weight is approximately 128.13 g/mol, matching 128.134.
- For COc1ccccc1Cl (2-chloroanisole, C7H7ClO), the molecular weight is approximately 142.58 g/mol, matching 142.585.

This consistency suggests that the property being reported is indeed the molecular weight in g/mol.

Now, let's calculate the molecular weight for the target molecule CCC#C (propyne, CH3-C≡CH):
- Carbon (C): 3 atoms × 12.01 g/mol = 36.03 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms × 1.008 g/mol = 4.032 g/mol
- Total molecular weight = 36.03 + 4.032 = 40.062 g/mol

Therefore, the predicted property value (molecular weight) for CCC#C is approximately 40.06 g/mol. Given the precision in the provided data (typically to three decimal places), I will round this to 40.062.

**Predicted property value for CCC#C: 40.062**

Iteration: 80
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 333.60400000000004
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I can infer that the property being described in the examples is likely the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) of the compounds, given in g/mol. The values provided for each molecule closely match the calculated molecular weights based on their chemical formulas derived from the SMILES notation.

To predict the property (molecular weight) for the given molecule, **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**, I will manually calculate its molecular weight by interpreting the SMILES string to determine the molecular formula.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES string
The SMILES string **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** represents a molecule with the following components:
- **CCO**: An ethoxy group (C2H5O-).
- **P(=S)**: A phosphorus atom double-bonded to sulfur.
- **(CC)**: An ethyl group (C2H5-) attached to phosphorus.
- **O**: An oxygen atom linking to the aromatic ring.
- **c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: A benzene ring (C6H3) with three chlorine (Cl) atoms substituted at positions 2, 4, and 6 (based on the SMILES notation).

Breaking it down:
- The benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms, but 3 hydrogens are replaced by Cl atoms, so the ring contributes C6H3Cl3.
- The ethoxy group (CCO) is C2H5O-.
- The ethyl group (CC) is C2H5-.
- Phosphorus (P) and sulfur (S) are present, with P connected to S via a double bond and to the other groups.
- Another oxygen (O) connects P to the benzene ring.

Thus, the molecular formula is:
- Carbon (C): 6 (from benzene) + 2 (from ethoxy) + 2 (from ethyl) = 10
- Hydrogen (H): 3 (from benzene) + 5 (from ethoxy) + 5 (from ethyl) = 13
- Oxygen (O): 1 (from ethoxy) + 1 (linking to benzene) = 2
- Phosphorus (P): 1
- Sulfur (S): 1
- Chlorine (Cl): 3

So, the molecular formula is **C10H13O2PSCl3**.

### Step 2: Calculate the molecular weight
Using approximate atomic weights (rounded to common values for simplicity, as I’m not using external tools):
- C: 12 g/mol
- H: 1 g/mol
- O: 16 g/mol
- P: 31 g/mol
- S: 32 g/mol
- Cl: 35.5 g/mol

Now, calculate:
- C: 10 × 12 = 120
- H: 13 × 1 = 13
- O: 2 × 16 = 32
- P: 1 × 31 = 31
- S: 1 × 32 = 32
- Cl: 3 × 35.5 = 106.5

Total molecular weight = 120 + 13 + 32 + 31 + 32 + 106.5 = **334.5 g/mol**

### Step 3: Cross-check with similar molecules
Looking at the provided dataset, there are molecules with similar structural features (e.g., phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and aromatic rings). For instance:
- **COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1** has a molecular weight of 367.86 g/mol, which includes P, S, Cl, and additional groups.
- My calculated value of 334.5 g/mol for **C10H13O2PSCl3** seems reasonable, as it has fewer heavy atoms compared to the above molecule but includes three Cl atoms, which contribute significantly to the mass.

### Final Prediction
Based on my manual calculation and reasoning, I predict the property (molecular weight) for the molecule **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl** to be approximately **334.5 g/mol**. Rounding to match the precision in the dataset, I will report it as **334.5**.

**Predicted Property Value: 334.5**

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 137.14200000000002
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1`. The property values in the given dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they closely match the calculated molecular weights for many of the molecules listed (e.g., `C=C` with a value of 28.054, which matches the molecular weight of ethene, C₂H₄). Therefore, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight of the molecule.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1` represents a molecule. Let's break it down:
- `c1nccc...c1` indicates a six-membered ring with one nitrogen atom (pyridine ring), where `n` is nitrogen and `c` represents carbon atoms. The ring is closed with the number `1`.
- `C(=O)NN` indicates a substituent attached to one of the carbon atoms in the ring. This represents a carbonyl group (`C(=O)`) bonded to a hydrazine group (`NN`, which is likely `NH-NH₂`).
- The substituent is likely attached to the carbon adjacent to the nitrogen in the pyridine ring (position 2), as this is a common interpretation in SMILES for such structures unless specified otherwise.

Thus, the molecule is likely 2-pyridinecarbohydrazide, with the formula C₆H₇N₃O.

### Step 2: Calculate the Molecular Weight
To predict the property (molecular weight), I will calculate the molar mass of the molecule based on its atomic composition:
- Carbon (C): 6 atoms × 12.01 g/mol = 72.06 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 7 atoms × 1.008 g/mol = 7.056 g/mol
- Nitrogen (N): 3 atoms × 14.01 g/mol = 42.03 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 1 atom × 16.00 g/mol = 16.00 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 72.06 + 7.056 + 42.03 + 16.00 = 137.146 g/mol

### Step 3: Compare with Similar Molecules in the Dataset
To validate my prediction, I will compare this molecule to similar structures in the provided dataset:
- `Nc1ccccc1Cl` (2-chloropyridine or similar) has a value of 127.574, which is close to the molecular weight of C₅H₄NCl (113.54 g/mol, though there might be a discrepancy in interpretation or data).
- `O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23` (a more complex pyridine derivative) has a value of 226.235, which aligns with a higher molecular weight due to additional groups.
- `c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23` (quinoline-like structure) has a value of 180.21, matching a molecular weight of C₁₃H₈N₂.

My calculated value of 137.146 g/mol for `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1` seems reasonable for a small pyridine derivative with a hydrazide group, as it falls within the range of molecular weights for similar small aromatic nitrogen-containing compounds in the dataset (e.g., 127.574 for `Nc1ccccc1Cl` and 151.129 for `Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2`).

### Final Prediction
Based on the calculation and comparison with the dataset, I predict the property value (molecular weight) for the molecule `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1` to be approximately **137.15**.

**Predicted Property Value: 137.15**

Iteration: 82
SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 353.4900000000001
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C. Since the property is not explicitly named in the query, I will assume it is a physical or chemical property such as molecular weight, boiling point, or a related measurable characteristic, as these are commonly associated with SMILES notation datasets. Given the range of values in the examples (from ~42 to ~390), it seems most likely that the property is molecular weight (in g/mol) or boiling point (in °C), as these are typical ranges for such properties in organic molecules.

### Step 1: Analyze the Molecule
The SMILES string for the target molecule is CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C. Let's break it down to understand its structure:
- **CCCO** and **OCCC**: These represent two propoxy groups (C3H7O-) attached to a central atom.
- **P(=S)**: Indicates a phosphorus atom double-bonded to sulfur, suggesting a thiophosphate group.
- **SCC(=O)**: Represents a sulfur atom connected to a carbon chain with a carbonyl group.
- **N1CCCCC1C**: Indicates a piperidine ring (a six-membered ring with nitrogen) substituted with a methyl group or connected at a specific carbon.

Overall, this molecule appears to be an organophosphorus compound, likely a pesticide or related structure (e.g., similar to malathion or parathion derivatives), with a thiophosphate core, alkyl chains, and a cyclic amide group.

### Step 2: Hypothesize the Property
Looking at the example data:
- Simple molecules like CC=C (propene, 42.081) and CCS (ethanethiol, 62.137) have low values.
- Larger, more complex molecules like ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl (chlordane-like, 364.914) have higher values.
- The values correlate roughly with molecular size and complexity, which is consistent with properties like molecular weight or boiling point.

I will assume the property is **molecular weight (g/mol)** for this prediction, as it is the most straightforward to estimate based on atom count and structure without computational tools. If it were boiling point, additional factors like polarity and hydrogen bonding would need more detailed consideration, but the trend still often correlates with size.

### Step 3: Estimate Molecular Weight
Let's calculate the approximate molecular weight by counting atoms from the SMILES string:
- **Carbon (C)**: Count from CCCO (3), OCCC (3), SCC (2), N1CCCCC1C (7, including the extra C on the piperidine ring) = 3 + 3 + 2 + 7 = 15 carbons.
- **Hydrogen (H)**: Estimate based on typical valences. Propoxy groups (CCCO and OCCC) contribute ~7H each (14 total), SCC contributes ~2H, and the piperidine ring with a substituent (N1CCCCC1C) contributes ~11H (considering ring saturation and substitution). Total H ≈ 14 + 2 + 11 = 27H.
- **Oxygen (O)**: From CCCO (1), OCCC (1), P(=S) (none additional), SCC(=O) (1) = 3 oxygens.
- **Sulfur (S)**: From P(=S) (1), SCC (1) = 2 sulfurs.
- **Phosphorus (P)**: 1 phosphorus.
- **Nitrogen (N)**: 1 nitrogen from the piperidine ring.

Approximate molecular formula: C15H27O3PS2N

Now, calculate the molecular weight:
- C: 15 × 12.01 = 180.15
- H: 27 × 1.008 = 27.216
- O: 3 × 16.00 = 48.00
- P: 1 × 30.97 = 30.97
- S: 2 × 32.06 = 64.12
- N: 1 × 14.01 = 14.01

Total ≈ 180.15 + 27.216 + 48.00 + 30.97 + 64.12 + 14.01 = 364.446 g/mol

### Step 4: Compare with Examples
Looking at the provided data, molecules with similar complexity and atom counts have property values in a comparable range:
- ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)
==================================================
Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 114.232
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I can infer that the property being predicted is likely the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the molecules, as the values given correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the compounds when interpreted from their SMILES strings. Molecular weight is a fundamental property in chemistry, calculated as the sum of the atomic weights of all atoms in a molecule, and the values in the dataset match this interpretation (e.g., for "CC(Cl)Cl" which is 1,1-dichloroethane, the molecular weight is approximately 98.96 g/mol, matching the given value).

The molecule in question is represented by the SMILES string "CCCCCCCC", which corresponds to octane, a straight-chain alkane with 8 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms, having the molecular formula C₈H₁₈.

To predict the molecular weight of octane:
- Carbon (C) has an atomic weight of approximately 12.01 g/mol.
- Hydrogen (H) has an atomic weight of approximately 1.008 g/mol.
- Octane has 8 carbon atoms and 18 hydrogen atoms.
- Therefore, the molecular weight = (8 × 12.01) + (18 × 1.008) = 96.08 + 18.144 = 114.224 g/mol.

Looking at the provided dataset for similar alkanes to confirm the trend:
- "CCC(O)CC" (pentan-3-ol, C₅H₁₂O) has a value of 88.15, which matches its molecular weight.
- "CCCCCCCO" (heptan-1-ol, C₇H₁₆O) has a value of 116.204, matching its molecular weight.
- "CCCC/C=C/C" (heptene, C₇H₁₄) has a value of 98.189, matching its molecular weight.
- "CCCCCC1CCCC1" (hexylcyclopentane, C₁₁H₂₂) has a value of 140.27, matching its molecular weight.

For straight-chain alkanes specifically, while "CCCCCCCC" (octane) is not directly in the list, I can observe the pattern in smaller alkanes and extrapolate:
- The dataset does not have a direct straight-chain alkane of similar length, but the molecular weight calculation is straightforward and consistent with the pattern of the dataset.

Since the property values in the dataset are consistent with molecular weights rounded to three decimal places in most cases, I will round my calculation accordingly. The molecular weight of octane (C₈H₁₈) is approximately 114.23 g/mol when rounded.

Thus, the predicted property value for "CCCCCCCC" (octane) is **114.23**.

**Final Answer: 114.23**

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 314.42500000000007
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule with the SMILES notation `CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C`. The property values in the given dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they are consistent with the calculated molecular weights for many of the provided molecules when considering their atomic compositions.

### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule
The SMILES string `CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C` represents a complex organic molecule, likely a steroid derivative or a polycyclic compound, given the presence of multiple rings (indicated by numbers 1, 2, 3, 4) and functional groups such as a ketone (`=O`), hydroxyl groups (`O`), and a triple bond (`C#C`, indicating an alkyne). To predict the property (assumed to be molecular weight), I will estimate the molecular formula by interpreting the SMILES string and then calculate the approximate molecular weight.

### Step 2: Interpret the SMILES String
- `CC34`: Indicates a carbon chain or substituent (likely a methyl group) connected to carbons labeled 3 and 4 in a ring system.
- `CCC1`: A chain of carbons leading to a ring carbon labeled 1.
- `C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)`: A carbon connected to a ring system with a ketone (`=O`) and a hydroxyl group (`O`) on carbon 2 of the ring.
- `C3CCC4(O)`: Another ring system with a hydroxyl group on carbon 4.
- `C#C`: An alkyne group (triple bond between two carbons) attached to the structure.

This SMILES describes a steroid-like structure with four fused rings (common in steroids like testosterone or cortisol derivatives), a methyl group, two hydroxyl groups, a ketone, and an alkyne substituent. Comparing this to similar molecules in the dataset, such as `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` (molecular weight 288.431) and `CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO` (molecular weight 392.467), it is clear that the target molecule is structurally related to steroids.

### Step 3: Estimate the Molecular Formula
To predict the molecular weight, I will approximate the molecular formula based on the SMILES and comparison to similar compounds:
- A typical steroid backbone (like testosterone) has a formula around C19H28O2 (for testosterone, molecular weight ~288.431, as seen in the dataset).
- The target molecule has additional features:
  - An alkyne group (`C#C`), adding 2 carbons (C2, contributing ~24 Da).
  - Two hydroxyl groups (`O`), as indicated by `(O)` in the SMILES, contributing ~32 Da (16 Da each).
  - A ketone group (`=O`), contributing ~16 Da.
  - A methyl group or additional carbons, likely contributing to a formula similar to other steroids in the dataset.

Comparing to `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` (C19H28O2, 288.431 Da), the target molecule has an additional `C#C` (C2, +24 Da) and an extra hydroxyl group (`O`, +16 Da). Thus, a rough estimate of the molecular formula might be around C21H30O3.

### Step 4: Calculate Approximate Molecular Weight
Using the estimated formula C21H30O3:
- Carbon: 21 atoms × 12.01 Da = 252.21 Da
- Hydrogen: 30 atoms × 1.008 Da = 30.24 Da
- Oxygen: 3 atoms × 16.00 Da = 48.00 Da
- Total = 252.21 + 30.24 + 48.00 = 330.45 Da

This value is close to some steroid derivatives in the dataset, such as `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` (330.468 Da), which also has a similar backbone and functional groups.

### Step 5: Refine Prediction Based on Dataset Trends
Looking at the dataset, steroid-like molecules range from 288.431 Da to 392.467 Da, depending on substituents:
- `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` (C19H28O2

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 588.5620000000001
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the given molecule. The property values in the examples appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they are consistent with the calculated molecular weights of the molecules described by their SMILES strings. For instance, benzene (c1ccccc1) has a value of 78.114, which matches its molecular weight (C6H6 = 6*12.01 + 6*1.008 = 78.114 g/mol), and other examples like Oc1ccccc1Cl (chlorophenol, 128.558) also align with their molecular weights.

Thus, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight of the molecule given by the SMILES string: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string represents a complex organic molecule, likely a natural product or derivative with multiple rings and functional groups. Let's break it down to understand its structure:
- **COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)**: This indicates a benzene ring (c1...c1) with substituents: two methoxy groups (CO, OC) and a hydroxy group (O).
- **C6C2C(COC2=O)**: This suggests a lactone or cyclic ester structure with a bridge or fused ring system.
- **C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)**: This part indicates a sugar-like moiety or glycoside with multiple oxygen atoms, likely a pyranose or furanose ring with substituents.
- **c7cc5OCOc5cc67**: This represents another aromatic system, possibly a benzodioxole or similar structure, fused or connected to the rest of the molecule.

The molecule appears to be a flavonoid glycoside or a similar natural product, with aromatic rings, a sugar moiety, and various oxygen-containing functional groups.

### Step 2: Estimate the Molecular Formula
To predict the molecular weight, I will estimate the molecular formula by counting the atoms based on the SMILES string. SMILES notation represents atoms explicitly (C, O, N, etc.) and hydrogens implicitly (based on valence rules). Let's parse the string systematically (though without computational tools, this will be an approximation for such a complex molecule):

- **Carbon atoms**: Count the explicit 'C' and 'c' (aromatic carbons) in the SMILES string.
  - From COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O): 6 carbons (benzene ring) + 2 carbons (from CO and OC) = 8 C.
  - C6C2C(COC2=O): At least 4-5 carbons (C6, C2, etc., indicate ring closures, not additional atoms directly).
  - OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O: Several carbons in the sugar-like ring (likely 5-6 for a pyranose).
  - c7cc5OCOc5cc67: Another 6-8 carbons for the aromatic system.
  - Total carbons: Approximately 25-30 (exact count requires precise parsing, but this is a rough estimate).
- **Oxygen atoms**: Count explicit 'O' in the SMILES.
  - CO, OC, O (hydroxy), COC, multiple O in the sugar part, OCO, etc.
  - Total oxygens: Approximately 10-12.
- **Hydrogen atoms**: Implicit in SMILES, based on valence. Aromatic rings and sugar moieties will have several hydrogens.
  - Rough estimate: 20-25 hydrogens.

A reasonable molecular formula might be around C27H30O12 (as a starting guess for a flavonoid glycoside like structure).

### Step 3: Calculate Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (C = 12.01, H = 1.008, O = 16.00):
- C27: 27 * 12.01 = 324.27
- H30: 30 * 1.008 = 30.24
- O12: 12 * 16.00 = 192.00
- Total = 324.27 + 30.24 + 192.00 = 546.51 g/mol

However, comparing with the provided dataset, complex molecules like C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21 (a steroid-like structure) have a molecular weight of 414.63, which is lower than

Iteration: 86
SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 128.558
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am tasked with predicting a property for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, which is chlorophenol (a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group and a chlorine atom as substituents). The property values given in the examples appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they are consistent with the expected molecular weights calculated from the molecular formulas derived from the SMILES notations. For instance:

- Clc1ccccc1I (chloroiodobenzene) has a value of 238.455, which matches the approximate molecular weight of C6H4ClI (6*12 + 4*1 + 35.5 + 127 ≈ 238.5).
- Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (nitrophenol) has a value of 139.11, matching C6H5NO3 (6*12 + 5*1 + 14 + 3*16 ≈ 139).
- Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) has a value of 96.104, matching C6H5F (6*12 + 5*1 + 19 ≈ 96).

Thus, I conclude that the property being predicted is the molecular weight (in g/mol).

Now, let's determine the molecular formula for Oc1ccccc1Cl:
- The SMILES notation Oc1ccccc1Cl indicates a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) with a hydroxyl group (O) and a chlorine atom (Cl) attached.
- The benzene ring corresponds to C6H6, but since two hydrogens are replaced by the substituents (OH and Cl), the formula becomes C6H4(OH)Cl, or simply C6H5OCl (since OH is one oxygen and one hydrogen, but the hydrogen is already accounted for in the benzene adjustment).

Calculating the molecular weight:
- Carbon (C): 6 atoms * 12.01 = 72.06
- Hydrogen (H): 5 atoms * 1.008 = 5.04
- Oxygen (O): 1 atom * 16.00 = 16.00
- Chlorine (Cl): 1 atom * 35.45 = 35.45
- Total = 72.06 + 5.04 + 16.00 + 35.45 = 128.55 g/mol

To refine the prediction, I can compare this molecule to similar ones in the dataset:
- Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (nitrophenol, C6H5NO3) has a molecular weight of 139.11. Replacing NO2 (46 g/mol) with Cl (35.5 g/mol) suggests a lower molecular weight, roughly 139.11 - (46 - 35.5) ≈ 128.6, which aligns with my calculation.
- Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene, C6H5Cl) is not directly in the list, but Clc1ccccc1I (C6H4ClI) is 238.455, and replacing I (127) with H (1) would give approximately 238.455 - 126 ≈ 112.5 for C6H5Cl. Adding an OH group (17 g/mol) instead of H would give roughly 112.5 + 16 ≈ 128.5, again consistent.

Given the consistency of my calculation and cross-references with similar molecules, I predict the property (molecular weight) for Oc1ccccc1Cl to be approximately 128.55.

**Predicted Property Value: 128.55**

Iteration: 87
SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 258.104
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being described for each molecule is the molecular weight (or molar mass) in g/mol. The values given for the molecules correspond closely to their calculated molecular weights based on their chemical formulas derived from the SMILES notation. Therefore, I will predict the molecular weight for the given molecule, ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, by calculating its molar mass using the atomic weights of its constituent atoms.

Let's break down the SMILES string ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 to determine the molecular formula:

- **Cl**: Chlorine atom (1 Cl)
- **C**: Carbon atom, part of "ClC" (1 C so far)
- **C#C**: Two carbons with a triple bond (2 more C, total 3 C)
- **C**: Another carbon (total 4 C)
- **O**: Oxygen atom (1 O)
- **C(=O)**: Carbon double-bonded to oxygen (1 more C, total 5 C; 1 more O, total 2 O)
- **N**: Nitrogen atom (1 N)
- **c1cccc(Cl)c1**: A benzene ring with 6 carbons and a chlorine substituent (6 more C, total 11 C; 1 more Cl, total 2 Cl). The hydrogens on the benzene ring need to be counted: a standard benzene ring (C6H6) has 6 hydrogens, but one is replaced by the N from the previous part, and one position has Cl, so 4 hydrogens remain on the ring.

Now, let's count the total atoms:
- The chain before the ring: Cl-C-C#C-C-O-C(=O)-N
  - Cl: 1
  - C: 5 (from ClC, C#C, C, and C(=O))
  - H: For ClC (CH2Cl, 2H), C#C (no H due to triple bond), C (CH2, 2H), so total 4H in this part
  - O: 2 (one from O and one from C(=O))
  - N: 1
- The ring: c1cccc(Cl)c1, connected to N
  - C: 6
  - Cl: 1
  - H: 4 (since two positions are substituted: one by N and one by Cl)

Total molecular formula:
- C: 5 (chain) + 6 (ring) = 11
- H: 4 (chain) + 4 (ring) = 8
- Cl: 1 (chain) + 1 (ring) = 2
- O: 2
- N: 1

So, the molecular formula is C11H8Cl2NO2.

Now, calculate the molecular weight using standard atomic weights:
- C: 12.011 × 11 = 132.121
- H: 1.008 × 8 = 8.064
- Cl: 35.453 × 2 = 70.906
- N: 14.007 × 1 = 14.007
- O: 16.000 × 2 = 32.000

Total molecular weight = 132.121 + 8.064 + 70.906 + 14.007 + 32.000 = 257.098 g/mol

Therefore, the predicted property value (molecular weight) for the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 is approximately **257.10**.

Iteration: 88
SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 331.202
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being predicted for the given molecules is their **molecular weight** (or molar mass) in g/mol. The values listed alongside each SMILES string correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the respective molecules, as inferred from their chemical structures.

To predict the property (molecular weight) for the molecule represented by the SMILES string `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl`, I will manually analyze the structure and calculate its molecular weight based on the atomic composition.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string `OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl` describes a molecule with a central carbon atom bonded to:
- An oxygen atom (likely as part of a hydroxyl group, -OH),
- A chlorinated phenyl ring (`c1ccc(Cl)cc1`, which is a benzene ring with a chlorine substituent),
- A heterocyclic ring (`c2cncnc2`, which corresponds to pyrimidine, a six-membered ring with two nitrogen atoms),
- Another chlorinated phenyl ring (`c3ccccc3Cl`, another benzene ring with a chlorine substituent).

The central carbon is tertiary, connected to three aromatic groups and one hydroxyl group, forming a structure like Ar1-Ar2-Ar3-C-OH, where Ar1 and Ar3 are chlorinated phenyls, and Ar2 is pyrimidine.

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
Let's break down the structure into its constituent atoms:

1. **Central part**: The central carbon and hydroxyl group contribute:
   - 1 Carbon (C)
   - 1 Oxygen (O)
   - 1 Hydrogen (H) from the -OH group

2. **First chlorinated phenyl ring (`c1ccc(Cl)cc1`)**:
   - 6 Carbons (C6)
   - 4 Hydrogens (H4) (since one H is replaced by Cl and another by the bond to the central carbon)
   - 1 Chlorine (Cl)

3. **Pyrimidine ring (`c2cncnc2`)**:
   - Pyrimidine (C4H4N2) has 4 Carbons and 2 Nitrogens, but since it's connected to the central carbon, one hydrogen is replaced, so:
     - 4 Carbons (C4)
     - 3 Hydrogens (H3)
     - 2 Nitrogens (N2)

4. **Second chlorinated phenyl ring (`c3ccccc3Cl`)**:
   - 6 Carbons (C6)
   - 4 Hydrogens (H4) (one H replaced by Cl, one by the bond to the central carbon)
   - 1 Chlorine (Cl)

Now, summing up the atoms:
- Carbons: 1 (central) + 6 (first phenyl) + 4 (pyrimidine) + 6 (second phenyl) = 17 C
- Hydrogens: 1 (from OH) + 4 (first phenyl) + 3 (pyrimidine) + 4 (second phenyl) = 12 H
- Oxygens: 1 O
- Nitrogens: 2 N
- Chlorines: 2 Cl

Thus, the molecular formula is **C17H12O1N2Cl2**.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using approximate atomic masses (commonly used in chemistry for quick calculations):
- C: 12.01 g/mol
- H: 1.008 g/mol
- O: 16.00 g/mol
- N: 14.01 g/mol
- Cl: 35.45 g/mol

Now, calculate the total molecular weight:
- C: 17 × 12.01 = 204.17
- H: 12 × 1.008 = 12.096
- O: 1 × 16.00 = 16.00
- N: 2 × 14.01 = 28.02
- Cl: 2 × 35.45 = 70.90

Total = 204.17 + 12.096 + 16.00 + 28.02 + 70.90 = **331.186 g/mol**

### Step 4: Refine the Prediction
The calculated value of approximately 331.19 g/mol fits within the range of molecular weights provided in the dataset (from 70.091 to 394.423). To ensure accuracy, I cross-checked the SMILES interpretation, and the structure seems consistent with a tertiary alcohol bearing two chlorinated phenyl rings and a pyrimidine ring. The molecular weight aligns with similar complex aromatic molecules in the dataset, such as `ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC
==================================================
Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 102.13299999999998
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being measured for the molecules is their **molecular weight** (or molar mass) in g/mol. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that the values correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the given molecules in the SMILES notation format. For example:

- CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O corresponds to a molecular weight of approximately 180.163 g/mol (calculated as C8H8N2O3).
- CCCC(=O)OCC corresponds to a molecular weight of approximately 116.16 g/mol (calculated as C6H12O2).
- CCS corresponds to a molecular weight of approximately 62.137 g/mol (calculated as C2H6S).

Thus, the task is to predict the molecular weight of the molecule represented by the SMILES string **CCCCOC=O**.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string **CCCCOC=O** represents a molecule. Let's break it down:
- **CCCC** represents a chain of four carbon atoms (a butane chain).
- **O** represents an oxygen atom connected to the last carbon of the chain.
- **C=O** represents a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom, indicating a carbonyl group, likely part of a formate or ester group.

Reading the string as a whole, **CCCCOC=O** can be interpreted as **CCCC-O-C=O**, which corresponds to a butyl formate molecule (butyl group attached to a formate group). The structure is:
- A butane chain (C4H9-).
- An oxygen atom linking the butane chain to a formate group (-O-CHO).

Thus, the molecular formula is **C5H10O2**:
- 5 carbon atoms (4 from the butyl chain + 1 from the formate group).
- 10 hydrogen atoms (9 from the butyl chain + 1 from the formate group).
- 2 oxygen atoms (1 from the ester linkage and 1 from the carbonyl in formate).

### Step 2: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights:
- Carbon (C): 12.011 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 15.999 g/mol

Molecular weight of C5H10O2:
- Carbon: 5 × 12.011 = 60.055 g/mol
- Hydrogen: 10 × 1.008 = 10.08 g/mol
- Oxygen: 2 × 15.999 = 31.998 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 60.055 + 10.08 + 31.998 = **102.133 g/mol**

### Step 3: Cross-Check with Similar Molecules
To validate, let's compare with similar molecules from the provided data:
- **CCCC(=O)OCC** (ethyl butanoate, C6H12O2) has a molecular weight of 116.16 g/mol, which is higher due to an additional carbon and two hydrogens.
- **CCCCCC=O** (hexanal, C6H12O) has a molecular weight of 100.161 g/mol, which is close but differs due to the absence of the second oxygen and different structure.

The calculated value of 102.133 g/mol for **CCCCOC=O** (butyl formate, C5H10O2) seems reasonable as it fits the trend of molecular weights for similar ester or aldehyde compounds in the dataset.

### Final Prediction
The predicted property (molecular weight) for the molecule **CCCCOC=O** is approximately **102.133 g/mol**. Rounding to three decimal places as per the format of the provided data, the value is **102.133**.

**Predicted Property Value: 102.133**
==================================================
Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 84.93299999999999
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am tasked with predicting a property for the molecule ClCCl (which is dichloromethane, CH2Cl2, though the SMILES notation ClCCl implies the same structure when interpreted with implicit hydrogens). The property values given in the examples appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) in g/mol, as they closely match the calculated molecular weights of the respective molecules. Let me verify this assumption with a few examples:

1. **CCC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1**: This is N-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)propanamide. Approximate molecular weight calculation: C=9*12=108, H=9*1=9, N=14, O=16, Cl=2*35.5=71; total = 108+9+14+16+71 = 218 g/mol, which matches the given value of 218.083.
2. **CCCCCCCCBr**: This is 1-bromooctane. C=8*12=96, H=17*1=17, Br=80; total = 96+17+80 = 193 g/mol, matching 193.128.
3. **ClCCCl**: This is 1,2-dichloroethane. C=2*12=24, H=4*1=4, Cl=2*35.5=71; total = 24+4+71 = 99 g/mol, very close to 98.96.

Since the property values consistently align with molecular weights, I conclude that the property being predicted is the molecular weight (molar mass) in g/mol.

Now, for the molecule **ClCCl**, which represents dichloromethane (CH2Cl2):
- Carbon (C): 1 atom * 12.01 g/mol = 12.01 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 2 atoms * 1.008 g/mol = 2.016 g/mol
- Chlorine (Cl): 2 atoms * 35.45 g/mol = 70.9 g/mol
- Total molecular weight = 12.01 + 2.016 + 70.9 = 84.936 g/mol

Rounding to three decimal places, as is common in the provided data, the predicted property value (molecular weight) for ClCCl is approximately **84.936**.

However, I notice that for ClCCCl (1,2-dichloroethane), the value is 98.96, which matches CH2ClCH2Cl, not CH2Cl2. Since ClCCl in SMILES notation typically represents CH2Cl2 (dichloromethane) with implicit hydrogens, I will stick with this interpretation unless the context suggests otherwise. There is no molecule in the list that directly matches CH2Cl2, so my calculation should hold.

Thus, the predicted property value for ClCCl is **84.936**.
==================================================
Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: 122.167
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am assuming the property in question is the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values given (e.g., 86.134 for CC1CCCO1, which corresponds to tetrahydro-2-methylfuran) closely match the molecular weights of the molecules when calculated manually. Molecular weight is a fundamental property in chemistry that depends on the atomic composition of a molecule, and it is a reasonable assumption given the context of molecular structures and numerical values.

Now, let's predict the molecular weight for the molecule **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**, which corresponds to 2,6-dimethylphenol (a benzene ring with two methyl groups at positions 2 and 6, and a hydroxyl group at position 1).

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES string
- **Cc1cccc(C)c1O**:
  - "c1cccc1" represents a benzene ring (6 carbon atoms in a cyclic structure).
  - "C" before "c1" indicates a methyl group (-CH3) attached to the first carbon of the ring.
  - "C" after "cccc" indicates another methyl group (-CH3) attached to the carbon at position 6 of the ring.
  - "O" after "c1" indicates a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the first carbon of the ring (though in standard numbering, it may adjust based on substituents).
  - Thus, the molecule is a benzene ring with two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group.

### Step 2: Determine the molecular formula
- Benzene ring: C6H6, but since it's substituted, we adjust for the substituents.
- Two methyl groups (-CH3): Each contributes 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens, so 2 × (C1H3) = C2H6.
- One hydroxyl group (-OH): Contributes 1 oxygen and 1 hydrogen.
- In a substituted benzene, the hydrogens on the ring are replaced by substituents. Benzene (C6H6) with three substituents (two -CH3 and one -OH) means 3 hydrogens are replaced, leaving 3 hydrogens on the ring.
- Total:
  - Carbon: 6 (from benzene) + 2 (from two methyls) = 8 carbons.
  - Hydrogen: 3 (remaining on benzene) + 6 (from two methyls) + 1 (from -OH) = 10 hydrogens.
  - Oxygen: 1 (from -OH).
- Molecular formula: C8H10O.

### Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight
- Atomic weights (approximate values used for simplicity, as in many of the provided data points):
  - Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
  - Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
  - Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol
- Total molecular weight:
  - Carbon: 8 × 12.01 = 96.08
  - Hydrogen: 10 × 1.008 = 10.08
  - Oxygen: 1 × 16.00 = 16.00
  - Total = 96.08 + 10.08 + 16.00 = 122.16 g/mol

### Step 4: Compare with similar molecules in the dataset
To validate, let's look at similar molecules in the provided list:
- **CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O** (likely 2-methyl-4-isopropylphenol or similar, with formula C10H14O): Property value = 150.221. Calculating: 10C (120.1) + 14H (14.112) + 1O (16) = 150.212, which matches closely.
- **Oc1cccc(O)c1** (1,3-dihydroxybenzene, C6H6O2): Property value = 110.112. Calculating: 6C (72.06) + 6H (6.048) + 2O (32) = 110.108, which matches closely.
- My calculated value for C8H10O (122.16) fits the pattern of increasing molecular weight with more carbon atoms.

### Final Prediction
Based on the molecular formula C8H10O for **Cc1cccc(C)c1O** (2,6-dimethylphenol), the predicted property value (molecular weight) is approximately **122.16**.

Thus, the predicted specific property value is **122.16**.

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 291.992
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being described for each molecule is the molecular weight (or molar mass) in g/mol. The values given for the molecules correspond closely to their calculated molecular weights based on their chemical formulas derived from the SMILES notation. Therefore, I will predict the molecular weight for the given molecule: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl represents a biphenyl derivative with chlorine substituents. Let's break it down:
- "c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)" describes a benzene ring (c1 to c1 indicates a ring closure) with a chlorine (Cl) attached to one carbon and another substituent (the second ring) attached to an adjacent carbon.
- "c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl" describes a second benzene ring with two chlorine atoms attached.
- The connection between the two rings is a single bond, forming a biphenyl structure.
- Total chlorine atoms: 4 (two on each ring as interpreted from the SMILES).

The molecule is a 1,1'-biphenyl with chlorines at positions 2, 4 on one ring and 2', 4' on the other ring (or similar, based on SMILES parsing). For molecular weight, the exact positions don't matter; only the total number of atoms does.

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
- **Carbon atoms**: Each benzene ring has 6 carbons, and since it's a biphenyl, there are 12 carbons total (C12).
- **Hydrogen atoms**: In unsubstituted biphenyl (C6H5-C6H5), there are 10 hydrogens (5 per ring after accounting for the bond between rings). With 4 chlorine substituents, 4 hydrogens are replaced. Thus, hydrogens = 10 - 4 = 6 (H6).
- **Chlorine atoms**: There are 4 chlorine atoms (Cl4).

So, the molecular formula is C12H6Cl4.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (approximate values for simplicity, as the provided data seems to use rounded values):
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
- Chlorine (Cl): 35.45 g/mol

Now calculate:
- Carbon: 12 × 12.01 = 144.12 g/mol
- Hydrogen: 6 × 1.008 = 6.048 g/mol
- Chlorine: 4 × 35.45 = 141.8 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 144.12 + 6.048 + 141.8 = 291.968 g/mol

### Step 4: Compare with Similar Molecules in the Dataset
To ensure accuracy, let's compare with similar molecules from the provided list:
- Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (a biphenyl with 5 Cl atoms) has a value of 326.437. Formula is C12H5Cl5. Calculated: 12*12.01 + 5*1.008 + 5*35.45 = 144.12 + 5.04 + 177.25 = 326.41, which matches.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (a biphenyl with 6 Cl atoms) has a value of 360.882. Formula is C12H4Cl6. Calculated: 144.12 + 4.032 + 212.7 = 360.852, which matches closely.

For our molecule, C12H6Cl4, removing one Cl from C12H5Cl5 (326.437) should reduce the weight by ~35.45, giving ~290.987, which aligns with our calculation of 291.968 (slight differences due to rounding in atomic weights).

### Final Prediction
Based on the calculation and comparison with similar molecules, the predicted property (molecular weight) for the molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is approximately **291.97 g/mol**. Rounding to three decimal places as in the dataset, the value is **291.968**.

**Predicted Property Value: 291.968**
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 70.13499999999999
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being listed next to each molecule is the molecular weight (or molar mass) in g/mol. The values correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the molecules when considering their chemical formulas derived from the SMILES notation. Therefore, I will predict the molecular weight for the given molecule, CC=C(C)C, using my knowledge of chemistry and molecular structures.

The SMILES notation CC=C(C)C represents a molecule with the structure of 2-methylpropene (or isobutene). Let's break it down:
- "C" represents a carbon atom.
- "CC=" indicates a carbon chain with a double bond between the second and third carbon.
- "=C(C)" indicates that the third carbon is double-bonded to another carbon, which has a methyl group (C) attached.
- The structure is thus: CH3-CH=C(CH3), but interpreting it correctly, it is (CH3)2C=CH2, which is 2-methylpropene.

Now, let's calculate the molecular formula:
- Carbon atoms: There are 4 carbon atoms (from CC=C(C), where the last C is a branch on the third carbon).
- Hydrogen atoms: Let's assign hydrogens based on valency.
  - The first carbon (CH3-) has 3 hydrogens.
  - The second carbon (=CH-) is part of a double bond, so it has 1 hydrogen.
  - The third carbon (=C<) is double-bonded and has a methyl group, so it has no hydrogens.
  - The fourth carbon (the branch, -CH3) has 3 hydrogens.
- Total: C4H8.

Now, calculate the molecular weight:
- Carbon: 12.011 g/mol × 4 = 48.044 g/mol
- Hydrogen: 1.008 g/mol × 8 = 8.064 g/mol
- Total molecular weight = 48.044 + 8.064 = 56.108 g/mol

Looking at the provided dataset, the molecular weights are often rounded to three decimal places. Therefore, I will round my calculation accordingly:
- 56.108 g/mol rounded to three decimal places is 56.108.

To confirm, let's compare with similar molecules in the dataset:
- Molecules with similar carbon counts, like CCCC (butane, though not in the list directly), or other small alkenes, should have comparable weights.
- For instance, CCCC=C (1-pentene) is not in the list, but CCCCCC=C (1-heptene) has a molecular weight of 98.186 (not listed, but calculable). A smaller alkene should have a lower weight, and C4H8 fits at 56.108.

Thus, my predicted property value (molecular weight) for CC=C(C)C is **56.108**.

**Final Answer: 56.108**

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 84.93299999999999
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, which is dichloromethane (CH₂Cl₂). The property values in the dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (in g/mol), as they align closely with the calculated molecular weights of the given molecules. For instance, C=CCCC=C (1-hexene) has a property value of 82.146, which matches its molecular weight (C₆H₁₂ = 6*12.01 + 12*1.008 = 84.16, approximately), and other examples like CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1 (acetanilide) at 135.166 also align with molecular weight calculations.

To predict the property for ClCCl (CH₂Cl₂), I will calculate its molecular weight:
- Carbon (C): 1 atom * 12.01 g/mol = 12.01 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 2 atoms * 1.008 g/mol = 2.016 g/mol
- Chlorine (Cl): 2 atoms * 35.45 g/mol = 70.90 g/mol
- Total molecular weight = 12.01 + 2.016 + 70.90 = 84.926 g/mol

Looking at the dataset, the property values are often rounded or slightly adjusted, but they are very close to the actual molecular weights. For example, ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl (tetrachloroethylene, C₂Cl₄) has a property value of 165.834, which is very close to its molecular weight (2*12.01 + 4*35.45 = 165.82 g/mol). Thus, I expect the property value for ClCCl to be close to its molecular weight.

Therefore, my predicted property value for ClCCl (CH₂Cl₂) is approximately **84.93**.

True Property: 197.448
Predicted Property:

Based on the provided data, I will predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, which represents 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group and three chlorine atoms at positions 2, 4, and 6). The property values in the dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) in g/mol, as the values match closely with the calculated molecular weights of the given molecules. For example:

- C1CC=CC1 (cyclopentene) has a property value of 68.119, which matches its molecular weight (C5H8: 5*12.01 + 8*1.008 = 68.11).
- CC(C)C (isobutane) has a property value of 58.124, matching its molecular weight (C4H10: 4*12.01 + 10*1.008 = 58.12).
- Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (2,4,6-trichlorophenol) in the dataset has a property value of 197.448, which aligns with its molecular weight (C6H3Cl3O: 6*12.01 + 3*1.008 + 3*35.45 + 16.00 = 197.45).

Since the molecule in question, **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl**, is also 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (the SMILES notation indicates a benzene ring with OH at position 1 and Cl at positions 2, 4, and 6), it is chemically identical to the molecule already in the dataset with the property value of 197.448.

Therefore, the predicted property value for **Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl** is **197.448**.

True Property: 588.5620000000001
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the given molecule. The property values in the dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they are consistent with the calculated molecular weights of the molecules when considering their SMILES representations. For instance, CCC(C)(C)CO (2-methyl-2-butanol) has a value of 102.177, which matches its approximate molecular weight (C6H14O = 102.17 g/mol), and C#C (ethyne) has a value of 26.038, matching its molecular weight (C2H2 = 26.04 g/mol). Therefore, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight of the molecule.

The molecule in question is represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67. This is a complex organic molecule, likely a natural product or derivative with multiple rings and functional groups, including methoxy groups, hydroxyl groups, ester/lactone functionalities, and sugar-like moieties.

To predict the molecular weight, I will break down the SMILES string into its constituent parts to estimate the molecular formula, though I will not perform an exact atom-by-atom count due to the complexity and the instruction to rely solely on knowledge without external tools. Instead, I will compare the structural features of this molecule to similar molecules in the dataset and estimate based on typical molecular weights of such compounds.

### Step 1: Analyze the SMILES String
- **COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)**: This part indicates a benzene ring with substituents: two methoxy groups (OCH3) and one hydroxyl group (OH). This is a tri-substituted benzene, likely a catechol or resorcinol derivative.
- **C6C2C(COC2=O)**: This suggests a bicyclic or bridged structure with a lactone ring (COC=O indicates a cyclic ester).
- **C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)**: This part indicates a glycosidic or sugar-like moiety with multiple oxygen atoms, likely a pyranose or furanose ring with additional substituents like a methyl group (C) and hydroxyl groups (O).
- **c7cc5OCOc5cc67**: This indicates another aromatic system, possibly a benzodioxole or similar structure with a methylene dioxy bridge (OCO).

Overall, the molecule appears to be a flavonoid glycoside or a lignan derivative with a sugar moiety attached, common in natural products like plant-derived compounds.

### Step 2: Estimate Molecular Weight
Given the complexity, I will estimate the molecular weight by comparing it to similar molecules in the dataset with comparable structural features:
- **OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O (342.297)**: This is a disaccharide (likely sucrose), with multiple hydroxyl groups and oxygen atoms.
- **CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO (362.466)**: This is a steroid derivative with multiple rings and oxygen-containing functional groups.
- **O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (380.444)**: This is a barbiturate derivative with multiple rings and heteroatoms.

The molecule in question has:
- At least two aromatic rings (one benzene, one possibly benzodioxole-like).
- A sugar-like moiety (similar to a hexose or pentose, contributing ~150-180 g/mol).
- Multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (methoxy, hydroxyl, lactone, etc.).
- A bicyclic or bridged system connecting the aromatic and sugar parts.

### Step 3: Rough Calculation
- A typical flavonoid aglycone (like quercetin) has a molecular weight of ~300 g/mol.
- Adding a sugar moiety (like glucose, ~180 g/mol, but minus water for glycosidic bond, ~162 g/mol) brings it to ~460 g/mol.
- However, the SMILES suggests additional substituents (methoxy groups, lactone, etc.), which may add another 30-60 g/mol.
- The benzodioxole-like structure and additional rings suggest a slightly higher weight than a simple flavonoid glycoside.

Considering the dataset, molecules with similar complexity (e.g., steroid derivatives or glycosides) have molecular weights in the range of 300-400 g/mol. Given the additional sugar and substituents, I estimate the molecular weight to be in the higher range.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 214.294
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am tasked with predicting a property for the molecule with the SMILES notation `CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C`. The property values in the given dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they are consistent with the expected molecular weights calculated from the atomic compositions of the molecules. For instance, methanol (`CO`) has a value of 32.042, which matches its molecular weight (C: 12.01, O: 16.00, H: 1.008 × 2 = 32.026, rounded to 32.042). Similarly, other examples like benzene (`c1ccccc1O` as phenol, 94.113) and simple alkanes match their molecular weights. Therefore, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight of the molecule.

Now, let's calculate the molecular weight of the target molecule `CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C` by breaking down its structure based on the SMILES notation.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES string
The SMILES `CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C` describes the molecular structure as follows:
- `CS`: A methyl group (CH₃) attached to a sulfur atom (S).
- `c1nnc`: A heterocyclic ring starting with a carbon (c1), followed by two nitrogens (nn), and another carbon (c), closing the ring (1). This suggests a 1,2,3,4-tetrazole-like or triazole-like structure, but we need to interpret the ring closure and substituents.
- `c(=O)n1N`: Attached to the ring carbon is a carbonyl group (`c(=O)`) and a nitrogen (`n1`) that closes the ring, with an additional nitrogen (`N`) likely as a substituent or part of a hydrazine-like group.
- `C(C)(C)C`: A tert-butyl group (a carbon with three methyl groups) attached to the ring.

After careful parsing, the structure appears to be a 1,2,4-triazole or similar heterocycle with:
- A methylthio group (`CH₃S-`) attached to one position.
- A carbonyl group and an additional nitrogen (possibly as part of a hydrazone or similar).
- A tert-butyl group (`-C(CH₃)₃`) attached to another position.

### Step 2: Determine the molecular formula
Let's count the atoms based on the SMILES:
- **Carbons (C)**:
  - `CS`: 1 carbon (from CH₃).
  - `c1` and `c` in the ring: 2 carbons.
  - `C(C)(C)C`: 4 carbons (1 central carbon + 3 methyl carbons).
  - Total C: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 carbons.
- **Hydrogens (H)**:
  - `CS`: CH₃ contributes 3 hydrogens.
  - Ring carbons: In SMILES, lowercase `c` implies aromatic carbons, but hydrogens depend on substitution. Given the structure, ring carbons may not have explicit hydrogens if fully substituted.
  - `C(C)(C)C`: Tert-butyl group is -C(CH₃)₃, so central carbon has no H, and each methyl has 3 H, total 9 H.
  - Additional `N` (likely NH₂ or NH): If it's a hydrazine-like group, it may contribute 2 H.
  - Total H (tentative): 3 (from CH₃S) + 9 (from tert-butyl) + 2 (from NH₂) = 14 H (subject to confirmation of nitrogen substitution).
- **Nitrogens (N)**:
  - `nn` in ring: 2 nitrogens.
  - `n1`: 1 nitrogen in ring.
  - `N`: 1 additional nitrogen.
  - Total N: 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 nitrogens.
- **Sulfur (S)**: 1 sulfur from `CS`.
- **Oxygen (O)**: 1 oxygen from `c(=O)`.

So, the tentative molecular formula is C₇H₁₄N₄OS. However, I need to verify the ring structure and hydrogen count, as triazole rings or similar heterocycles may adjust hydrogen counts based on aromaticity or tautomerism.

### Step 3: Calculate molecular weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded for simplicity):
- C: 12.01 × 7 = 84.07
- H: 1.008 × 14 = 14.112
- N: 14.007 × 4
==================================================
Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 150.177
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, which is ethyl benzoate. The property in question appears to be the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values given in the examples correspond closely to the molecular weights of the respective molecules when calculated based on their chemical formulas.

### Step 1: Analyze the given data
The examples provided include SMILES notations of molecules and their corresponding property values. For instance:
- CC (ethane) has a value of 30.07, which matches its molecular weight (C2H6, 2*12.01 + 6*1.008 = 30.068).
- Nc1ccccc1 (aniline) has a value of 93.129, which matches its molecular weight (C6H7N, 6*12.01 + 7*1.008 + 14.01 = 93.128).
- OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O (glucose) has a value of 180.156, matching its molecular weight (C6H12O6, 6*12.01 + 12*1.008 + 6*16.00 = 180.156).

This confirms that the property being predicted is the molecular weight of the molecule in g/mol.

### Step 2: Determine the molecular formula of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
The SMILES notation CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 represents ethyl benzoate. Let's break it down:
- "CCO" represents the ethyl group attached to an oxygen (part of the ester group): C2H5O-.
- "C(=O)" represents a carbonyl group (C=O).
- "c1ccccc1" represents a benzene ring (C6H5- in this context, as one carbon is part of the ester group).

Thus, the molecule is an ester formed from benzoic acid and ethanol, with the structure C6H5-C(=O)-O-C2H5. The molecular formula is:
- Carbon: 6 (from benzene) + 1 (from carbonyl) + 2 (from ethyl) = 9 carbons.
- Hydrogen: 5 (from benzene, since one H is replaced) + 5 (from ethyl) = 10 hydrogens.
- Oxygen: 1 (from carbonyl) + 1 (from ester linkage) = 2 oxygens.

So, the molecular formula is C9H10O2.

### Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight
Using standard atomic weights:
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol

Molecular weight of C9H10O2:
- Carbon: 9 * 12.01 = 108.09
- Hydrogen: 10 * 1.008 = 10.08
- Oxygen: 2 * 16.00 = 32.00

Total molecular weight = 108.09 + 10.08 + 32.00 = 150.17 g/mol

### Step 4: Compare with similar molecules in the dataset
To validate, I can look at structurally similar molecules in the provided list:
- CCCC(=O)OCC (butyl acetate, C6H12O2) has a value of 130.187, which matches its molecular weight.
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 (a more complex molecule) has a higher value, consistent with additional atoms.

Since ethyl benzoate (C9H10O2) has more carbon atoms due to the benzene ring compared to butyl acetate, a molecular weight of around 150 seems reasonable.

### Final Prediction
The predicted property value (molecular weight) for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is **150.17**.

**Answer: 150.17**
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 179.101
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane). The property values in the dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they closely match the calculated molar masses for the given SMILES strings. For instance:

- CSSC (dimethyldisulfide) has a property value of 94.204, which matches its molar mass (C2H6S2: 2*12.01 + 6*1.008 + 2*32.06 = 94.20 g/mol).
- CCCC(=O)CCC (heptan-2-one) has a value of 114.188, matching its molar mass (C7H14O: 7*12.01 + 14*1.008 + 16.00 = 114.19 g/mol).
- Cc1ccc(N)cc1 (p-toluidine) has a value of 107.156, matching its molar mass (C7H9N: 7*12.01 + 9*1.008 + 14.01 = 107.16 g/mol).

Thus, I conclude that the property being reported is the **molecular weight** (in g/mol).

Now, let's calculate the molecular weight for **CCCCCCCBr** (1-bromoheptane, C7H15Br):
- Carbon (C): 7 atoms * 12.01 g/mol = 84.07 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 15 atoms * 1.008 g/mol = 15.12 g/mol
- Bromine (Br): 1 atom * 79.90 g/mol = 79.90 g/mol
- Total molecular weight = 84.07 + 15.12 + 79.90 = **179.09 g/mol**

To refine the prediction, I observe that the dataset values are often rounded to three decimal places. Additionally, looking at similar compounds:
- CCCCCCCO (1-heptanol, C7H16O) has a value of 116.204, close to its molar mass of 116.20 g/mol.
- Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (2-bromonaphthalene) has a value of 207.07, matching its molar mass.

Given the consistency with molar mass and the structure of **CCCCCCCBr** as a straight-chain alkane with a bromine substituent, I predict the property value to be very close to the calculated molar mass.

Therefore, my predicted property value for **CCCCCCCBr** is **179.090**.

**Final Answer: 179.090**
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 32.042
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being listed next to each molecule is the molecular weight (or molar mass) in grams per mole (g/mol). The values correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the molecules based on their chemical formulas, as derived from their SMILES notations. For example:

- For CN2C(=O)CN=C(c1ccccc1)c3cc(ccc23)N(=O)=O, the value is 295.298, which matches the approximate molecular weight of the compound.
- For CCC (propane, C3H8), the value is 44.097, which is the molecular weight of propane.
- For CC#C (propyne, C3H4), the value is 40.065, which matches its molecular weight.

Thus, I will assume the property to predict for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide) is its molecular weight.

### Step-by-Step Prediction for CO:
- The molecular formula of CO is carbon monoxide, which consists of one carbon atom (C) and one oxygen atom (O).
- Atomic weight of carbon (C) = 12.011 g/mol
- Atomic weight of oxygen (O) = 15.999 g/mol
- Molecular weight of CO = 12.011 + 15.999 = 28.010 g/mol

### Predicted Property Value for CO:
The predicted molecular weight for CO is **28.010 g/mol**.
==================================================
Iteration: 4
SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 346.46700000000016
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the given molecule, which appears to be a steroid-like structure with functional groups such as a hydroxyl group, a ketone, and an aldehyde or alcohol group at the end of a side chain. The property values in the provided dataset seem to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as the values are consistent with the calculated molecular weights of the molecules when considering their SMILES representations.

### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule
The SMILES string for the target molecule is `CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO`. Let's break it down to understand its structure:
- This SMILES represents a complex polycyclic structure, likely a steroid backbone (four fused rings, typical of steroids like cholesterol or cortisol).
- Key functional groups include:
  - `CC12...`: Indicates a carbon framework with methyl groups and ring fusions.
  - `CC(O)...`: Indicates a hydroxyl group (`-OH`) on a carbon in the ring.
  - `C(=O)CCC...`: Indicates a ketone group (`C=O`) in one of the rings.
  - `C(=O)CO`: Indicates a side chain with a carbonyl group (`C=O`) and a terminal alcohol (`-OH`), likely forming an aldehyde or a similar group, though it might represent a ketone with a hydroxymethyl group based on SMILES interpretation.

This structure resembles a corticosteroid or a derivative of cholesterol, with a molecular formula that can be derived by counting the atoms.

### Step 2: Estimate the Molecular Formula
To predict the molecular weight (the property in question), I will estimate the molecular formula of the molecule based on the SMILES string:
- The steroid backbone typically has a structure like C19 (for androstane) or C21 (for pregnane derivatives), with additional functional groups.
- Let's count the carbons and other atoms:
  - The SMILES `CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO` suggests a pregnane-like structure (C21 base) with additional carbons in the side chain.
  - Base structure (steroid nucleus): Likely C21H32O (for a pregnane derivative with one ketone).
  - Functional groups:
    - `CC(O)`: Hydroxyl group adds 1 oxygen.
    - `C(=O)` in ring: Already accounted for in base structure.
    - `C(=O)CO`: Side chain likely adds 2 carbons and 2 oxygens (one from carbonyl, one from alcohol).
  - Total estimation:
    - Carbons: ~21 (base) + 2 (side chain) = 23 carbons.
    - Hydrogens: ~30–32 (base, adjusted for unsaturation and functional groups) - 2 (for hydroxyl and carbonyl) + 2 (side chain) ≈ 30 hydrogens.
    - Oxygens: 1 (ring ketone) + 1 (hydroxyl) + 2 (side chain carbonyl and alcohol) = 4 oxygens.
  - Molecular formula: Approximately C23H30O4 (rough estimate).

### Step 3: Calculate Approximate Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (C = 12.01, H = 1.008, O = 16.00):
- C23: 23 * 12.01 = 276.23
- H30: 30 * 1.008 = 30.24
- O4: 4 * 16.00 = 64.00
- Total: 276.23 + 30.24 + 64.00 = 370.47 g/mol

However, steroid structures often have more hydrogens due to the saturated nature of many rings. Revising the hydrogen count based on a typical pregnane derivative (e.g., cortisol-like structure, C21H30O5, MW ~362), and considering the side chain, the formula might be closer to C21H30O4 or C22H32O4.

Looking at a similar molecule in the dataset:
- `CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C`, with a property value of 314.469, corresponds to C20H30O2 (calculated MW = 302.45, but likely adjusted or typo in data; it might be C21H30O2 or similar).

Adjusting for the target molecule, which has additional oxygen-containing groups (`C(=O)CO` and `O`), I estimate:
- Base structure similar to C21H30O2 (MW ~314).
- Add side chain `C(=O)CO`: + C2H2O2 (MW = 58).
- Total rough estimate: 314 + 58 = 372, but hydrogens need adjustment.

### Step 4: Refine Prediction
Given the complexity, I cross-check with typical molecular weights of steroids:
- Cortisol (C21H30O5) has MW = 362.46.
- The target molecule lacks one oxygen compared to cortisol (no additional hydroxyl on side chain) but has a similar backbone.
- Likely formula: C21H30O4 (MW = 346.46) or C22H32O4 (MW = 360.49).

Considering the dataset's closest analog (MW = 314.469 for a simpler steroid), and adding the side chain and hydroxyl, I predict a value slightly higher than 314 but lower than cortisol's 362.

### Final Prediction
After careful consideration of the SMILES and comparison with dataset examples, I predict the property value (molecular weight) for the molecule `CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO` to be approximately **346.46**. However, aligning with the precision in the dataset, I will round it to three decimal places as seen in most examples.

**Predicted Property Value: 346.460**

This value is based on an estimated molecular formula of C21H30O4, which fits a corticosteroid-like structure with the described functional groups. If the exact structure differs slightly (e.g., additional hydrogens or misinterpretation of the side chain), the value might be adjusted slightly, but this is my best prediction based on the given information.
==================================================
Iteration: 5
SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 310.687
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule `Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2`. The property values in the given dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (in g/mol), as they align closely with the calculated molar masses of the molecules listed. Therefore, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES notation `Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2` describes a molecule with the following structural features:
- A benzene ring substituted with two fluorine (F) atoms at positions 1 and 3 (or meta positions relative to each other).
- A carbonyl group (C=O) attached to the benzene ring, forming part of an amide or urea-like linkage.
- A urea group (NC(=O)N) connecting the fluorinated benzene ring to a second benzene ring.
- The second benzene ring is substituted with a chlorine (Cl) atom at the para position relative to the urea linkage.

Breaking it down:
- `Fc1cccc(F)c1`: A benzene ring (c1...c1) with F at positions 1 and 3.
- `C(=O)NC(=O)N`: A urea linkage with two carbonyl groups.
- `c2ccc(Cl)cc2`: A second benzene ring with Cl at the para position.

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
To predict the molecular weight, I will calculate the molecular formula by counting the atoms:
- **Carbon (C)**: 
  - First benzene ring: 6 carbons.
  - Second benzene ring: 6 carbons.
  - Carbonyl carbons in urea linkage: 2 carbons (one for each C=O).
  - Total C = 6 + 6 + 2 = 14.
- **Hydrogen (H)**:
  - First benzene ring: Normally 6 H, but 2 are replaced by F, and 1 position is substituted by the urea group, so 6 - 2 - 1 = 3 H.
  - Second benzene ring: Normally 6 H, but 1 is replaced by Cl, and 1 position is substituted by the urea group, so 6 - 1 - 1 = 4 H.
  - Nitrogen atoms in urea (NC(=O)N): Each N is bonded to one H (as in a typical urea structure), so 2 H.
  - Total H = 3 + 4 + 2 = 9.
- **Nitrogen (N)**: In the urea linkage (NC(=O)N), there are 2 N atoms.
- **Oxygen (O)**: In the urea linkage, there are 2 O atoms (one per carbonyl).
- **Fluorine (F)**: 2 F atoms on the first benzene ring.
- **Chlorine (Cl)**: 1 Cl atom on the second benzene ring.

Thus, the molecular formula is **C14H9N2O2F2Cl**.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded to three decimal places for precision):
- C: 12.011 g/mol
- H: 1.008 g/mol
- N: 14.007 g/mol
- O: 15.999 g/mol
- F: 18.998 g/mol
- Cl: 35.453 g/mol

Now, calculate the molecular weight:
- C: 14 × 12.011 = 168.154 g/mol
- H: 9 × 1.008 = 9.072 g/mol
- N: 2 × 14.007 = 28.014 g/mol
- O: 2 × 15.999 = 31.998 g/mol
- F: 2 × 18.998 = 37.996 g/mol
- Cl: 1 × 35.453 = 35.453 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 168.154 + 9.072 + 28.014 + 31.998 + 37.996 + 35.453 = **310.687 g/mol**.

### Step 4: Cross-Check with Dataset Trends
Looking at the provided dataset, the property values match closely with molecular weights for various molecules. For instance:
- `CCCCCCCCBr` (C8H17Br): Calculated MW ≈ 193.13, given as 193.128.
- `CCCC(O)CC` (C6H14O): Calculated MW ≈ 102.17, given as 102.177.
- `BrC(Br)(Br)Br` (CBr4): Calculated MW ≈ 331.63, given as 331.627.

The values are consistent with molecular weights, confirming my assumption. Additionally, for molecules with similar functional groups (e.g., urea or amide linkages like `CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O` with MW 198.222), the property aligns with molecular weight.

### Final Prediction
For the molecule `Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2`, the predicted property value (molecular weight) is approximately **310.687**. Rounding to three decimal places as per the dataset format, the value is **310.687**.

**Predicted Property Value: 310.687**
==================================================
Iteration: 7
SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 261.119
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**. The property values in the given dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they are consistent with the calculated molecular weights of the molecules when considering their SMILES representations. Therefore, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight (in g/mol).

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string for the target molecule is **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O**. Let's break it down to understand the molecular structure:
- **CCC(C)** represents a butyl group with a branch, specifically a 2-methylpropyl group (or isobutyl), which is a chain of 3 carbons with a methyl branch on the second carbon, totaling 4 carbons.
- **n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O** describes a heterocyclic ring, specifically a pyrimidine-like structure with two carbonyl groups (indicating a barbituric acid derivative or similar), a methyl group (**C**), and a bromine atom (**Br**) as substituents on the ring.
- The ring is a 6-membered heterocycle with nitrogens at positions 1 and 3, and carbonyls at positions 2 and 6, with the methyl and bromine on the carbons between them.

This structure is likely a 5-bromo-4-methyl-1-(1-methylpropyl)-2,6-dioxopyrimidine or a similar derivative of uracil/barbituric acid.

### Step 2: Calculate the Molecular Formula
To predict the molecular weight, I will determine the molecular formula by counting the atoms:
- **Carbon (C)**:
  - From **CCC(C)**: 4 carbons (isobutyl group).
  - From the ring and substituents: The ring has 4 carbons (positions 2, 4, 5, 6 in pyrimidine, but 2 and 6 are part of carbonyls), plus 1 carbon from the methyl group (**c(C)**), totaling 5 carbons in the ring system.
  - Total carbons = 4 (from alkyl chain) + 5 (from ring and substituent) = 9 carbons.
- **Hydrogen (H)**:
  - From **CCC(C)**: The isobutyl group (C4H9) has 9 hydrogens.
  - From the ring: The ring has an **nH** (1 hydrogen on nitrogen), and the methyl group (**c(C)**) contributes 3 hydrogens. The ring carbons at positions 4 and 5 may have hydrogens, but since position 4 has a methyl substituent and position 5 has bromine, no additional hydrogens are on those carbons.
  - Total hydrogens = 9 (from alkyl chain) + 1 (from nH) + 3 (from methyl) = 13 hydrogens.
- **Nitrogen (N)**: The ring has 2 nitrogens (positions 1 and 3 in pyrimidine).
- **Oxygen (O)**: There are 2 carbonyl groups (**=O**) in the ring, so 2 oxygens.
- **Bromine (Br)**: There is 1 bromine atom as a substituent on the ring.

Thus, the molecular formula is **C9H13N2O2Br**.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded to common values for simplicity, as the provided data seems to use such approximations):
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol × 9 = 108.09 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol × 13 = 13.104 g/mol
- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol × 2 = 28.02 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol × 2 = 32.00 g/mol
- Bromine (Br): 79.90 g/mol × 1 = 79.90 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 108.09 + 13.104 + 28.02 + 32.00 + 79.90 = **261.114 g/mol**

### Step 4: Compare with Dataset Trends
Looking at the provided dataset, the property values match closely with molecular weights for the given SMILES strings. For example:
- **c1ccoc1** (furan, C4H4O) has a property of 68.075, close to the calculated 68.07 g/mol.
- **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl** (1,2,3-trichlorobenzene, C6H3Cl3) has a property of 181.449, close to 181.45 g/mol.
- **CC(C)CCO** (C5H12O) has a property of 88.15, matching 88.15 g/mol.

This confirms that the property is indeed molecular weight. My calculated value of 261.114 g/mol for **C9H13N2O2Br** is consistent with the precision and rounding in the dataset (typically to 3 decimal places).

### Step 5: Final Prediction
Considering the structure and the dataset's precision, I will round the molecular weight to three decimal places, as is common in the provided data.

**Predicted property value: 261.114**

This value is reasonable when compared to similar molecules in the dataset, such as **CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1** (C8H8NOBr, property 214.062, close to calculated 214.06 g/mol), where the presence of bromine contributes significantly to the mass, as it does in my target molecule.

Thus, the predicted property value for the molecule **CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O** is **261.114**.

True Property: 238.28699999999995
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I am tasked with predicting a property for the molecule with the SMILES notation `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C`. The property values given in the examples appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they are consistent with the expected molecular weights calculated from the atomic compositions of the molecules. For instance, `Clc1ccccc1` (chlorobenzene) has a value of 112.559, which matches its molecular weight (C6H5Cl: 6*12 + 5*1 + 35.5 ≈ 112.5), and `CC(C)C` (isobutane) has a value of 58.124, matching its molecular weight (C4H10: 4*12 + 10*1 = 58). Therefore, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight of the molecule.

Now, let's analyze the target molecule `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C` to determine its molecular formula and calculate its molecular weight.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES notation
The SMILES string `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C` describes a cyclic molecule with substituents. Let's break it down:
- `O=C1` indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a carbon atom labeled as 1, which is part of a ring.
- `NC(=O)` indicates a nitrogen atom connected to the previous carbon, and this nitrogen is also part of a carbonyl group (likely an amide or imide structure).
- `NC(=O)` repeats, suggesting another nitrogen with a carbonyl, indicating a cyclic structure with multiple carbonyls, likely a barbituric acid-like structure or a similar heterocycle.
- `C1` closes the ring back to the first carbon.
- `(C(C)CCC)` is a branch attached to the carbon labeled 1, representing a carbon atom with a methyl group (`C(C)`) and a propyl chain (`CCC`), so it's a butyl-like group with a branch, specifically a 1-methylbutyl group or similar.
- `CC=C` is another substituent, likely an allyl or propenyl group attached to the same carbon.

Upon closer inspection, this SMILES likely represents a barbituric acid derivative (a six-membered ring with three carbonyls and two nitrogens) with two substituents on the carbon at position 5 (since barbituric acid is often numbered with carbonyls at 2,4,6 and nitrogens at 1,3, and the carbon between the nitrogens at 5). The substituents are:
- `C(C)CCC`, which is a pentyl chain with a methyl branch, likely representing a 1-methylbutyl group (i.e., -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3).
- `CC=C`, which is a propenyl group, likely -CH2-CH=CH2 (allyl group).

So, the base structure is barbituric acid (C4H4N2O3), and we add the substituents at carbon 5, replacing two hydrogens.

### Step 2: Determine the molecular formula
- **Base structure (barbituric acid without substituents at C5):** C4H4N2O3.
- In barbituric acid, carbon 5 has two hydrogens (C5H2). When substituents are added, these hydrogens are replaced.
- **First substituent: C(C)CCC** → This is interpreted as -CH(CH3)CH2CH2CH3, which is a 5-carbon chain with a methyl branch, so total C5H11 (since -CH- has one H, methyl is CH3, and the chain CH2CH2CH3 contributes the rest). Molecular formula contribution: C5H11.
- **Second substituent: CC=C** → This is -CH2-CH=CH2 (allyl group), which is C3H5.
- At carbon 5, originally C5H2 in barbituric acid, it becomes C5(R1)(R2), where R1 and R2 are the substituents, so we remove 2H from the base and add the substituents.

Base formula: C4H4N2O3.
Carbon 5 in barbituric acid is CH2, so its contribution is C1H2. When substituted, it becomes C1 (no H), plus substituents C5H11 and C3H5.
- Remove H2 from base: C4H2N2O3.
- Add substituents: C5H11 + C3H5 = C8H16.
- Total formula: C4H2N2O3 + C8H16 = C12H18N2O3.

### Step 3: Calculate molecular weight
- Carbon (C): 12 atoms * 12.011 = 144.132
- Hydrogen (H): 18 atoms * 1.008 = 18.144
- Nitrogen (N): 2 atoms * 14.007 = 28.014
- Oxygen (O): 3 atoms * 15.999 = 47.997
- Total molecular weight = 144.132 + 18.144 + 28.014 + 47.997 = 238.287

### Step 4: Cross-check with similar molecules
Looking at the provided data, there is a similar molecule: `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C`, with a property value of 182.179.
- Base: C4H4N2O3.
- Substituents at C5: `C` (methyl, CH3, C1H3) and `CC=C` (allyl, C3H5).
- Adjust base to C4H2N2O3 (remove 2H), add C1H3 + C3H5 = C4H8.
- Total: C8H10N2O3.
- Molecular weight: (8*12.011) + (10*1.008) + (2*14.007) + (3*15.999) = 96.088 + 10.08 + 28.014 + 47.997 = 182.179, which matches.

In my target molecule, the substituent `C(C)CCC` is larger than `C` (methyl). Specifically, `C(C)CCC` is C5H11 vs. `C` as C1H3, so an increase of C4H8, which should add about (4*12 + 8*1) = 56 to the molecular weight.
- 182.179 (for the smaller molecule) + 56 ≈ 238, which aligns with my calculation of 238.287.

### Final Prediction
Based on the molecular formula C12H18N2O3 and the calculated molecular weight, I predict the property value (molecular weight) for the molecule `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C` to be approximately **238.287**.

**Predicted Property Value: 238.287**
==================================================
Iteration: 14
SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 180.156
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I can infer that the property being predicted is likely the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) of the molecules, as the values given in the examples correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the compounds when interpreted using their SMILES notation. Molecular weight is a fundamental property in chemistry, calculated as the sum of the atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule, and it fits the pattern of the numerical values provided (e.g., values like 360.45, 328.843, etc., are consistent with molecular weights in g/mol).

Now, let's analyze the molecule in question with the SMILES notation: **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O**. This represents a cyclic sugar-like structure, specifically a six-membered ring with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups, which is characteristic of a hexose sugar such as glucose in its cyclic form (pyranose form).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Interpret the SMILES string**:
   - "C1" and "C1" indicate a ring closure, forming a six-membered ring (since there are 5 carbons and 1 oxygen in the ring based on the notation).
   - "OCC1" indicates a -CH2OH group attached to the first carbon of the ring.
   - "OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O" describes the ring structure with an oxygen atom in the ring and multiple hydroxyl groups attached to the carbons.
   - This structure corresponds to a cyclic hexose, likely glucose or a similar sugar, with the formula C6H12O6.

2. **Determine the molecular formula**:
   - Carbons (C): 6 (5 in the ring + 1 from the -CH2OH group).
   - Hydrogens (H): 12 (based on the structure of a hexose sugar, with -OH and -CH2OH groups).
   - Oxygens (O): 6 (1 in the ring + 5 from hydroxyl groups).
   - Molecular formula: C6H12O6.

3. **Calculate the molecular weight**:
   - Atomic masses (approximate values used in chemistry):
     - Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol
     - Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
     - Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol
   - Molecular weight = (6 × 12.01) + (12 × 1.008) + (6 × 16.00)
     - Carbon contribution: 6 × 12.01 = 72.06
     - Hydrogen contribution: 12 × 1.008 = 12.096
     - Oxygen contribution: 6 × 16.00 = 96.00
     - Total = 72.06 + 12.096 + 96.00 = 180.156 g/mol

4. **Cross-check with provided data**:
   - In the provided list, a similar molecule, **OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO**, which represents the linear form of a hexose (e.g., glucose), has a property value of 182.172. This is very close to the calculated molecular weight of C6H12O6 (180.156), with slight variation possibly due to rounding or specific isotopic considerations in the dataset.
   - Since the cyclic form (OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O) and linear form have the same molecular formula (C6H12O6), their molecular weights should be identical.

5. **Prediction**:
   - Given the consistency in the dataset and the calculated molecular weight, the property value for **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** should be approximately 180.156 g/mol.
   - Adjusting for the slight variation seen in the dataset (e.g., 182.172 for the linear form), I will predict a value close to this, considering possible rounding or dataset-specific conventions.

### Final Predicted Property Value:
I predict the property value for the molecule **OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O** to be **180.156**. However, aligning with the precision and slight variation in the provided data (e.g., 182.172 for a similar molecule), I will round it to **180.16** to match the typical format of the dataset.

**Predicted Value: 180.16**
==================================================
Iteration: 16
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 290.44699999999995
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O. The property values in the given dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (in g/mol), as they align closely with the calculated molecular weights of the molecules based on their SMILES notations. For instance, Brc1ccccc1 (bromobenzene) has a property value of 157.01, which matches its molecular weight, and ClCCl (dichloromethane) has a value of 84.933, also matching its molecular weight. Therefore, I will assume the property being predicted is the molecular weight.

To predict the molecular weight of the target molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O, I will interpret its SMILES notation to determine its structure and calculate the molecular weight based on the atomic composition.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES Notation
The SMILES string CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O represents a polycyclic structure, likely a steroid or similar compound, given the presence of multiple rings (indicated by numbers 1, 2, 3, 4) and functional groups like a ketone (=O) and a hydroxyl group (O at the end). Let's break it down:

- **C** represents carbon atoms.
- Numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) indicate ring closures, showing how atoms are connected to form cyclic structures.
- **=O** indicates a double bond to oxygen, representing a carbonyl group (ketone).
- **O** at the end likely represents a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to carbon 4 in the ring system.

This SMILES string describes a molecule with a steroid-like backbone, consisting of four fused rings (three six-membered and one five-membered, typical of steroids), with a methyl group (CC), a ketone on one of the rings, and a hydroxyl group.

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
To calculate the molecular weight, I need the molecular formula (i.e., the count of each type of atom). Let's analyze the structure:

- The SMILES suggests a steroid nucleus, which typically has 17 carbon atoms in the core structure (e.g., androstane or pregnane skeleton).
- The "CC" at the beginning likely represents additional carbon atoms, possibly methyl groups attached to the steroid core (common at positions like C10 or C13 in steroids).
- The numbers (1,2,3,4) indicate the connectivity of the rings, confirming a tetracyclic structure.
- "CC(=O)" indicates a ketone group, contributing one oxygen atom.
- "O" at the end indicates a hydroxyl group, contributing another oxygen atom and a hydrogen atom.

Counting the atoms based on a typical steroid structure (e.g., testosterone or similar):
- Base structure of a steroid like androstane has C19H30 (for a structure with two methyl groups at C10 and C13).
- However, the SMILES starts with "CC34", suggesting additional carbons or a different numbering, but likely still around C19 or C21 if it includes an extra side chain or methyl groups.
- Let's count the explicit carbons in the SMILES string: there are multiple "C" characters, and considering the ring closures, it aligns with a C19 or C20 base structure.
- Functional groups:
  - Ketone (CC(=O)) adds 1 oxygen.
  - Hydroxyl (O) adds 1 oxygen and 1 hydrogen.

A similar molecule in the dataset, CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O, has a property value of 272.388, which corresponds to C19H28O2 (molecular weight = 272.38 g/mol). This suggests a structure like testosterone or a similar steroid.

For the target molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O, the structure appears very similar, likely also C19H28O2, as it has a ketone and a hydroxyl group like testosterone.

### Step 3: Calculate Molecular Weight
Assuming the molecular formula is C19H28O2 (based on similarity to testosterone or androsterone-like structures in the dataset):
- Carbon: 19 atoms × 12.011 = 228.209 g/mol
- Hydrogen: 28 atoms × 1.008 = 28.224 g/mol
- Oxygen: 2 atoms × 15.999 = 31.998 g/mol
- Total = 228.209 + 28.224 + 31.998 = 288.431 g/mol

However, the dataset value for a similar molecule is 272.388, which suggests I may have miscalculated the hydrogens. Let's correct this:
- Testosterone (C19H28O2) has a molecular weight of 288.42, but the dataset shows 272.388 for a similar structure, which might be C19H28O2 minus a small discrepancy or a different isomer.
- Recalculating for C19H28O2: 19*12 + 28*1 + 2*16 = 228 + 28 + 32 = 288, which doesn't match the dataset's 272.388 for the similar molecule. The dataset molecule CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O likely has an aromatic ring (indicated by lowercase "c"), reducing the hydrogen count (e.g., C19H26O2 = 286.41, still not 272.388, suggesting a possible typo or different interpretation).

Upon rechecking, the target SMILES lacks lowercase "c", indicating no aromaticity, so it should be a fully saturated or partially unsaturated steroid. Let's finalize the formula as C19H30O2 (if fully saturated with two extra hydrogens):
- C19H30O2 = 19*12 + 30*1 + 2*16 = 228 + 30 + 32 = 290.44 g/mol

But comparing to the dataset, the closest structure's property is 272.388, suggesting C18H24O2 or an error. Let's trust the pattern and predict based on similarity.

### Step 4: Predict Based on Similarity
Since the SMILES is very similar to CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O (property = 272.388), and despite the aromatic difference, the structures are likely analogous in carbon count. However, the target molecule lacks aromaticity, so it may have more hydrogens. Given the discrepancy, I will predict a value close to 288 (C19H28O2), but adjust based on dataset trends.

Looking at the dataset, steroid-like molecules have property values around 270-290. Thus, I predict the property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O to be approximately **288.42**, aligning with C19H28O2, typical for a molecule like testosterone.

### Final Answer
The predicted property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O is **288.42**.
==================================================
Iteration: 17
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 180.163
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being predicted is the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the molecules, as the values given correspond closely to the molecular weights of the compounds listed (in g/mol). For example:

- COc1ccc(C=O)cc1 (anisaldehyde) has a molecular weight of approximately 136.15 g/mol.
- CC(C)C(C)O (3-methyl-2-butanol) has a molecular weight of approximately 88.15 g/mol.
- O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (nitrobenzene) has a molecular weight of approximately 123.11 g/mol.

Thus, I will predict the molecular weight of the target molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O using my knowledge of molecular structures and atomic weights.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES string
The SMILES string CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O represents a molecule. Let's break it down:
- CC(=O) indicates an acetyl group (CH3C=O).
- N indicates a nitrogen atom connected to the acetyl group, forming an amide bond.
- c1ccc(cc1) represents a benzene ring (c1 to c6, with c1 connected back to c6).
- N(=O)=O indicates a nitro group (-NO2) attached to the benzene ring.
- The structure is interpreted as acetanilide with a nitro group on the benzene ring. Specifically, since it's cc1 (para or meta position not explicitly specified in SMILES, but based on standard interpretation, it's likely para due to symmetry in "cc1ccc(cc1)"), the nitro group is para to the amide group.

Thus, the molecule is 4-nitroacetanilide (CH3C(O)NH-C6H4-NO2, with NO2 at the para position).

### Step 2: Calculate the molecular formula
- Carbon (C): 
  - 2 from the acetyl group (CH3CO).
  - 6 from the benzene ring.
  - Total C = 8.
- Hydrogen (H):
  - 3 from the methyl group (CH3).
  - 4 from the benzene ring (since two positions are substituted by NH and NO2, leaving 4 hydrogens).
  - 1 from the NH group.
  - Total H = 3 + 4 + 1 = 8.
- Nitrogen (N):
  - 1 from the amide (NH).
  - 1 from the nitro group (NO2).
  - Total N = 2.
- Oxygen (O):
  - 1 from the carbonyl (C=O).
  - 2 from the nitro group (NO2).
  - Total O = 3.

Molecular formula: C8H8N2O3.

### Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight
Using approximate atomic weights:
- C: 12.01 g/mol
- H: 1.008 g/mol
- N: 14.01 g/mol
- O: 16.00 g/mol

Molecular weight = (8 × 12.01) + (8 × 1.008) + (2 × 14.01) + (3 × 16.00)
= 96.08 + 8.064 + 28.02 + 48.00
= 180.164 g/mol

Rounding to three decimal places (as in the provided data), the molecular weight is approximately 180.164 g/mol.

### Step 4: Cross-check with similar molecules
Looking at the provided data:
- O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (nitrobenzene, C6H5NO2) has a molecular weight of 123.111 g/mol.
- COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (nitroanisole, C7H7NO3) has a molecular weight of 153.137 g/mol.
- My calculated value for C8H8N2O3 (180.164 g/mol) seems consistent as it includes an additional acetylamide group compared to nitrobenzene, which reasonably increases the mass.

### Final Prediction
The predicted property (molecular weight) for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is **180.164**.

Iteration: 18
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 367.8160000000001
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12. From the context of the examples, it appears that the property being predicted is likely the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values correspond closely to the molecular weights of the molecules described by their SMILES strings.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 represents a molecule with the following structural components:
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)**: This indicates a thiophosphate group with two ethoxy groups (OCC) attached to a phosphorus atom, which is double-bonded to sulfur (=S).
- **SC**: A sulfur atom connected to a carbon, likely part of a linker.
- **n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12**: This represents a heterocyclic ring system, specifically an oxazolidinone or isoxazoline-like structure fused to a benzene ring with a chlorine (Cl) substituent.

Breaking it down further:
- The molecule contains a thiophosphate ester group, a sulfur-containing linker, and a chlorinated benzoxazolidinone-like moiety.

### Step 2: Estimate the Molecular Formula
To predict the molecular weight, I will approximate the molecular formula by counting the atoms based on the SMILES string:
- **Carbon (C)**: 
  - From CCOP: 2 (from CCO) + 2 (from OCC) = 4
  - From SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12: The ring system and substituents contribute approximately 7 carbons (6 from the benzene ring + 1 from the heterocyclic ring).
  - Total C ≈ 11
- **Hydrogen (H)**:
  - From CCOP(OCC): Each ethyl group (CCO) has 5H (2 from CH2, 3 from CH3), so 2 ethyl groups = 10H.
  - From the ring system: The benzene ring with substitutions (Cl and fusion) has approximately 4H (since Cl replaces one H and fusion may reduce H count).
  - Total H ≈ 14
- **Oxygen (O)**:
  - From CCOP(=S)(OCC): 2 O (one per ethoxy group).
  - From c(=O)o in the ring: 2 O.
  - Total O = 4
- **Sulfur (S)**:
  - From P(=S): 1 S.
  - From SC: 1 S.
  - Total S = 2
- **Phosphorus (P)**: 1 P (from the thiophosphate group).
- **Nitrogen (N)**: 1 N (from the heterocyclic ring, indicated by "n1").
- **Chlorine (Cl)**: 1 Cl (from the benzene ring substituent).

Approximate molecular formula: C11H14O4S2PNCl

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded for simplicity):
- C: 12.01 × 11 = 132.11
- H: 1.008 × 14 = 14.11
- O: 16.00 × 4 = 64.00
- S: 32.06 × 2 = 64.12
- P: 30.97 × 1 = 30.97
- N: 14.01 × 1 = 14.01
- Cl: 35.45 × 1 = 35.45

Total molecular weight ≈ 132.11 + 14.11 + 64.00 + 64.12 + 30.97 + 14.01 + 35.45 = 354.77 g/mol

### Step 4: Refine the Prediction
The calculated value of approximately 354.77 seems reasonable, but I will cross-check by comparing the molecule to similar structures in the provided dataset. The molecule contains a thiophosphate group, a chlorinated aromatic ring, and a heterocyclic system, which are somewhat similar to compounds like CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 (MW = 298.367) and Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (MW = 147.004). However, the presence of phosphorus and additional sulfur and oxygen atoms suggests a higher molecular weight.

I notice that my carbon count might be slightly off due to the complexity of the heterocyclic ring. Recounting the SMILES string CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12:
- CCOP(OCC): 4 C (2 per ethyl group).
- SC: 0 C (just sulfur and a bond to carbon in the ring).
- n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12: The "c2...c12" indicates a benzene ring (6 C) fused to a heterocyclic ring. The heterocyclic part "n1c(=O)o" suggests 1 additional C in the ring.
- Total C = 4 (from ethyls) + 6 (benzene) + 1 (heterocycle) = 11 C (confirmed).

Hydrogen count:
- Each ethyl group (CCO) is CH3-CH2-O, so 5H each × 2 = 10H.
- Benzene ring (c2cc(Cl)ccc12): Normally 6H, but Cl replaces 1H, and fusion/heterocycle connections reduce H count. Likely 3-4H remain.
- Total H ≈ 13-14.

Recalculating with H=13:
- C11: 132.11
- H13: 13.10
- O4: 64.00
- S2: 64.12
- P1: 30.97
- N1: 14.01
- Cl1: 35.45
- Total ≈ 353.76

This is very close to my initial estimate.

### Step 5: Final Prediction
Given the molecular complexity and similarity to other organophosphorus compounds or chlorinated heterocycles in the dataset, I predict the property (molecular weight) to be approximately **353.8**. Rounding to match the precision of the provided data (typically three decimal places or whole numbers), I will finalize the value as **354.0**.

**Predicted Property Value: 354.0**

This value is based on my manual calculation of the molecular weight from the interpreted SMILES string and comparison with the dataset's trends. If the property is not molecular weight, the prediction would need adjustment, but the context strongly suggests it is.
==================================================
Iteration: 19
SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 88.14999999999999
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I will predict the property value for the molecule **CC(C)(C)CO**. From the context of the examples, it appears that the property being measured is likely the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the molecules when interpreted using their SMILES notation.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string for the target molecule is **CC(C)(C)CO**, which represents a branched alcohol. Let's break it down:
- **CC(C)(C)** indicates a central carbon atom bonded to three methyl groups (i.e., a tert-butyl group).
- **CO** indicates that the central carbon is also bonded to a -CH2OH group (a hydroxymethyl group).
- Therefore, the molecule is **2-methyl-2-propanol** or **tert-butanol** with the structure (CH3)3C-CH2OH. However, upon closer inspection, the correct interpretation of **CC(C)(C)CO** is actually (CH3)3C-OH, where the central carbon is bonded to three methyl groups and one hydroxyl group (tert-butanol). I will proceed with this interpretation.

### Step 2: Calculate the Molecular Weight
To predict the property (assuming it is molecular weight), I will calculate the molar mass of **CC(C)(C)CO**, which is tert-butanol, (CH3)3C-OH:
- Carbon (C): 4 atoms × 12.01 g/mol = 48.04 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 10 atoms × 1.008 g/mol = 10.08 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 1 atom × 16.00 g/mol = 16.00 g/mol
- Total molecular weight = 48.04 + 10.08 + 16.00 = **74.12 g/mol**

### Step 3: Cross-Check with Similar Molecules
Looking at the provided dataset, there are similar alcohols with known property values:
- **CC(C)CO** (isobutanol, (CH3)2CHCH2OH): Property value = 74.123
- **CCCC(O)CCC** (4-heptanol): Property value = 116.204
- **CCCCCCC(C)O** (2-octanol): Property value = 130.231
- **CCCCCCCC(C)O** (2-nonanol): Property value = 144.258

For **CC(C)CO**, which is isobutanol (C4H10O), the molecular weight is indeed approximately 74.12 g/mol, matching the provided value of 74.123. Similarly, my calculated value for **CC(C)(C)CO** (tert-butanol, also C4H10O) is 74.12 g/mol, which is consistent with the molecular formula.

### Step 4: Predict the Property Value
Since **CC(C)(C)CO** corresponds to tert-butanol (C4H10O), and its calculated molecular weight is 74.12 g/mol, I predict the property value to be very close to that of similar molecules with the same molecular formula in the dataset (e.g., **CC(C)CO** at 74.123).

Thus, my predicted property value for **CC(C)(C)CO** is **74.12**.

### Final Answer

Iteration: 20
SMILES: O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 
True Property: 136.114
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule with the SMILES notation `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12`. The property values in the given dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (in g/mol), as they align closely with the calculated molecular weights of the molecules based on their atomic compositions.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES Notation
The SMILES string `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` represents a heterocyclic compound, likely a purine-like structure or a related imidazo[4,5-d]imidazole derivative. Let's break it down:
- `O=c1` indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) connected to a ring.
- `[nH]` represents a nitrogen atom with a hydrogen attached, part of the ring.
- `cnc` and `nc[nH]c` indicate a fused bicyclic structure with alternating carbon and nitrogen atoms.
- The numbers `1` and `2` denote ring closures, indicating a fused ring system.

This structure corresponds to a molecule with a formula likely to be C₅H₄N₄O (based on counting atoms in the SMILES and considering the fused ring system).

### Step 2: Calculate the Molecular Weight
To predict the property (molecular weight), I will calculate the approximate molecular weight based on the atomic composition:
- Carbon (C): 5 atoms × 12.01 g/mol = 60.05 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 4 atoms × 1.008 g/mol = 4.032 g/mol
- Nitrogen (N): 4 atoms × 14.01 g/mol = 56.04 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 1 atom × 16.00 g/mol = 16.00 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 60.05 + 4.032 + 56.04 + 16.00 = **136.122 g/mol**

### Step 3: Compare with Similar Molecules in the Dataset
Looking at the provided dataset, I can identify molecules with similar structural features (e.g., heterocyclic rings, nitrogen-rich structures) to validate my prediction:
- `Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F` (likely 5-fluorouracil or a related compound) has a property value of 129.094 g/mol, which is close to its molecular weight (C₄H₃FN₂O₂ = 130.08 g/mol).
- `Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1` (likely uracil) has a property value of 111.104 g/mol, close to its molecular weight (C₄H₄N₂O₂ = 112.09 g/mol).
- `COc2ncc1nccnc1n2` (a purine-like derivative) has a property value of 162.152 g/mol, consistent with a molecular weight for a similar nitrogen-rich heterocycle.

My calculated value of 136.122 g/mol for `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` fits within the range of molecular weights for nitrogen-rich heterocyclic compounds in the dataset.

### Step 4: Final Prediction
Given the consistency between the calculated molecular weight and the property values in the dataset, I predict the property value for the molecule `O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12` to be approximately **136.12 g/mol**. Rounding to three decimal places (as seen in the dataset), the predicted value is **136.122**.

**Predicted Property Value: 136.122**

Iteration: 25
SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 333.266
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the given molecule, which appears to be the molecular weight (in g/mol) based on the context of the examples provided. The examples list various organic molecules alongside numerical values that correspond closely to their molecular weights, a common property in chemistry related to molecular structure.

The molecule in question is: **CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**. Let's break down the structure to estimate its molecular weight by identifying the atoms and functional groups present.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES notation describes the molecular structure. Let's parse it:
- **CCN(CC(C)=C)**: This indicates a nitrogen atom (N) connected to two ethyl groups (CC) and a propenyl group (CC(C)=C), suggesting a tertiary amine.
- **c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**: This describes a benzene ring (c1...c1) with substituents:
  - Two nitro groups (N(=O)=O) at positions 1 and 2 (or similar, based on the notation).
  - A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) at another position on the ring.
  - The nitrogen from the amine is connected to the benzene ring.

The structure is a benzene ring substituted with two nitro groups (-NO₂), a trifluoromethyl group (-CF₃), and a tertiary amine group with ethyl and propenyl substituents.

### Step 2: Count the Atoms
Let's calculate the molecular formula by counting each type of atom:
- **Carbon (C)**:
  - From the amine part: CCN (2 carbons from one ethyl), CC (2 carbons from another ethyl), CC(C)=C (4 carbons from the propenyl group) = 8 carbons.
  - From the benzene ring: 6 carbons.
  - From the trifluoromethyl group: 1 carbon.
  - Total C = 8 + 6 + 1 = 15 carbons.
- **Hydrogen (H)**:
  - From the amine part: First ethyl (CC) is C₂H₅ (5H, but one H is replaced by N connection, so effectively part of the chain), second ethyl (CC) similarly, and propenyl (CC(C)=C) has 7H but adjusts for connections.
    - First ethyl: C₂H₅ → 5H.
    - Second ethyl: C₂H₅ → 5H.
    - Propenyl: CC(C)=C → interpret as C₄H₇ (since it's a chain with a double bond and a methyl branch).
    - Total from amine substituents: 5 + 5 + 7 = 17H, but since it's a tertiary amine connected to the ring, no additional H on N.
  - Benzene ring: Normally C₆H₆, but with 4 substituents (2 NO₂, 1 CF₃, 1 amine), only 2 hydrogens remain on the ring.
  - Total H = 17 (from amine substituents) + 2 (from benzene) = 19H.
- **Nitrogen (N)**:
  - From the amine: 1 N.
  - From two nitro groups: 2 N.
  - Total N = 1 + 2 = 3 nitrogens.
- **Oxygen (O)**:
  - From two nitro groups: Each NO₂ has 2 oxygens, so 2 × 2 = 4 O.
  - Total O = 4 oxygens.
- **Fluorine (F)**:
  - From trifluoromethyl (C(F)(F)F): 3 F.
  - Total F = 3 fluorines.

So, the molecular formula is **C₁₅H₁₉N₃O₄F₃**.

### Step 3: Calculate Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded for simplicity):
- C: 12.01 g/mol × 15 = 180.15
- H: 1.008 g/mol × 19 = 19.152
- N: 14.01 g/mol × 3 = 42.03
- O: 16.00 g/mol × 4 = 64.00
- F: 19.00 g/mol × 3 = 57.00

Total molecular weight = 180.15 + 19.152 + 42.03 + 64.00 + 57.00 = **362.332 g/mol**.

### Step 4: Compare with Examples
Looking at the provided data, the property values match closely with molecular weights of the molecules (e.g., CCN(CC)c1ccccc1 = 149.237, close to calculated MW of ~149.23 for C₁₀H₁₅N). The slight deviations are likely due to rounding or specific isotopic considerations, but the trend confirms the property is molecular weight.

### Final Prediction
For the molecule **CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**, the predicted property value (molecular weight) is approximately **362.33**.

**Predicted Property Value: 362.33**
==================================================
Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 122.16699999999996
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being described for each molecule is the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) in g/mol. This conclusion is drawn from the consistent correlation between the molecular formulas (represented in SMILES notation) and the numerical values, which match the expected molecular weights of the compounds when calculated manually for several examples. For instance:

- CO (methanol) has a value of 32.042, which matches its molecular weight (C: 12.01, O: 16.00, H: 1.008 × 2 = 32.026, rounded to 32.042).
- CC(C)C (isobutane) has a value of 58.124, matching its molecular weight (C: 12.01 × 4, H: 1.008 × 10 = 58.124).
- c1ccccc1O (phenol) has a value of 94.113, matching its molecular weight (C: 12.01 × 6, H: 1.008 × 6, O: 16.00 = 94.114, rounded to 94.113).

Thus, the task is to predict the molecular weight of the molecule **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1**, which represents 2,4-dimethylphenol (a benzene ring with two methyl groups at positions 2 and 4, and a hydroxyl group at position 1).

### Step-by-Step Calculation of Molecular Weight for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
The SMILES notation **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** corresponds to a benzene ring (C6H6) substituted with:
- Two methyl groups (-CH3), each contributing 1 carbon and 3 hydrogens.
- One hydroxyl group (-OH), contributing 1 oxygen and 1 hydrogen.

Let's break down the molecular formula:
- **Carbon atoms**: 
  - Benzene ring: 6 carbons.
  - Two methyl groups: 2 carbons.
  - Total carbons = 6 + 2 = 8.
- **Hydrogen atoms**:
  - Benzene ring (C6H6) has 6 hydrogens, but with 3 substituents (2 methyls and 1 hydroxyl), 3 hydrogens are replaced.
  - Remaining hydrogens on benzene: 6 - 3 = 3.
  - Two methyl groups: 2 × 3 = 6 hydrogens.
  - Hydroxyl group: 1 hydrogen.
  - Total hydrogens = 3 + 6 + 1 = 10.
- **Oxygen atoms**: 
  - From hydroxyl group: 1 oxygen.

Thus, the molecular formula is **C8H10O**.

Now, calculate the molecular weight using standard atomic masses:
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol × 8 = 96.08 g/mol.
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol × 10 = 10.08 g/mol.
- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol × 1 = 16.00 g/mol.
- Total molecular weight = 96.08 + 10.08 + 16.00 = **122.16 g/mol**.

### Cross-Verification with Similar Molecules
To ensure accuracy, I can compare this with similar molecules from the provided list:
- **c1ccccc1O** (phenol, C6H6O): 94.113 g/mol. This has 6 carbons, 6 hydrogens, and 1 oxygen.
- **Cc1cccc(C)c1** (m-xylene, C8H10, not in the list but inferred): would be around 106.17 g/mol (8C + 10H). Adding an oxygen (as in hydroxyl) would increase it by ~16, bringing it close to 122, which matches our calculation.
- **c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC** (a substituted phenol with a long chain): 194.274 g/mol, which includes additional carbons and hydrogens but supports the base weight of phenol derivatives.

Since 2,4-dimethylphenol (C8H10O) is structurally similar to phenol but with two additional methyl groups, the calculated increase in mass (2 × CH3 = 2 × 15.035 = ~30.07) from phenol (94.113 + 30.07 ≈ 124.183, adjusted for exact values to 122.16) aligns with expectations.

### Predicted Property Value
Therefore, the predicted molecular weight for **Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1** is **122.16 g/mol**. Given the precision in the provided data (typically to 3 decimal places), I will round it accordingly.

**Final Answer: 122.160**
==================================================
Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 278.335
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**. The property in question appears to be related to molecular weight (or molar mass, in g/mol), as the values provided in the examples closely match the calculated molecular weights of the respective molecules. For instance:

- OC1CCCCC1 (cyclohexanol) has a property value of 100.161, which matches its molecular weight (C6H12O = 100.16 g/mol).
- Cc1ccc(O)c(C)c1 (2,5-dimethylphenol) has a value of 122.167, matching its molecular weight (C8H10O = 122.16 g/mol).
- CCOC=O (ethyl formate) has a value of 74.079, matching its molecular weight (C3H6O2 = 74.08 g/mol).

Thus, I will assume the property is molecular weight and calculate it for the target molecule based on its structure.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** represents a molecule with the following components:
- **COP(=S)(OC)O-**: This indicates a thiophosphate group, where a phosphorus atom is bonded to a sulfur atom (double bond, =S), two methoxy groups (OCH3), and one oxygen that connects to the aromatic ring.
- **-c1ccc(SC)c(C)c1**: This represents a benzene ring with substituents. The ring has:
  - A connection to the oxygen of the thiophosphate at position 1.
  - A thiomethyl group (-SCH3) at position 4 (based on the SMILES order).
  - A methyl group (-CH3) at position 5 (based on the SMILES order).

So, the molecule is a thiophosphate ester with a substituted benzene ring (1-oxythiophosphate-4-thiomethyl-5-methylbenzene).

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
Let's break down the atoms in the molecule:
- **Carbon (C)**:
  - Benzene ring: 6 carbons.
  - Two methyl groups on the thiophosphate (OCH3): 2 carbons.
  - Methyl group on the benzene ring: 1 carbon.
  - Thiomethyl group (-SCH3) on the benzene ring: 1 carbon.
  - Total C = 6 + 2 + 1 + 1 = **10 carbons**.
- **Hydrogen (H)**:
  - Benzene ring: Normally 6H, but with 3 substituents (O-, -SCH3, -CH3), only 3H remain on the ring.
  - Two methoxy groups (OCH3): Each has 3H, so 2 × 3 = 6H.
  - Methyl group on benzene (-CH3): 3H.
  - Thiomethyl group (-SCH3): 3H.
  - Total H = 3 + 6 + 3 + 3 = **15 hydrogens**.
- **Oxygen (O)**:
  - Two methoxy groups (OCH3): 2 oxygens.
  - One oxygen connecting phosphorus to the benzene ring: 1 oxygen.
  - Total O = 2 + 1 = **3 oxygens**.
- **Phosphorus (P)**: 1 phosphorus atom (from the thiophosphate group).
- **Sulfur (S)**:
  - One sulfur double-bonded to phosphorus (=S): 1 sulfur.
  - One sulfur in the thiomethyl group (-SCH3): 1 sulfur.
  - Total S = 1 + 1 = **2 sulfurs**.

Thus, the molecular formula is **C10H15O3PS2**.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded to three decimal places for precision):
- C: 12.011 g/mol
- H: 1.008 g/mol
- O: 15.999 g/mol
- P: 30.974 g/mol
- S: 32.06 g/mol

Now, calculate the total molecular weight:
- C: 10 × 12.011 = 120.11
- H: 15 × 1.008 = 15.12
- O: 3 × 15.999 = 47.997
- P: 1 × 30.974 = 30.974
- S: 2 × 32.06 = 64.12

Total = 120.11 + 15.12 + 47.997 + 30.974 + 64.12 = **278.321 g/mol**

### Step 4: Compare with Similar Molecules in the Dataset
To validate, I note that the dataset includes similar thiophosphate compounds, such as:
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: Property value = 321.549 (molecular weight of C8H9Cl3O3PS ≈ 321.55 g/mol).
- **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl**: Property value = 366.0 (molecular weight of C8H9BrCl2O3PS ≈ 366.00 g/mol).

These confirm that the property is indeed molecular weight. My calculated value of 278.321 for **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** is reasonable, as it lacks heavy halogens (Cl, Br, I) present in the other examples, which increase molecular weight. Instead, it has lighter substituents (-SCH3 and -CH3), leading to a lower value.

### Final Prediction
The predicted property value (molecular weight) for the molecule **COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1** is approximately **278.321**.

**Final Answer: 278.321**
==================================================
Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 144.21399999999997
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being predicted for the molecules is their **molecular weight** (or molar mass) in g/mol. This conclusion is drawn from the consistent correlation between the molecular structures (given in SMILES notation) and the numerical values, which align with typical molecular weights for organic compounds.

Now, let's predict the molecular weight for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC**, which is represented in SMILES notation.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES string
The SMILES string **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** describes a molecule as follows:
- **CCCCCC** represents a chain of 6 carbon atoms (hexane backbone).
- **(=O)** indicates a double bond to an oxygen atom, suggesting a carbonyl group (C=O), which, in this context, is part of an ester group since it is followed by **OCC**.
- **OCC** indicates an oxygen atom connected to a two-carbon chain (ethyl group).
- Therefore, the molecule is an ester, specifically **hexanoic acid ethyl ester** (ethyl hexanoate), with the structure CH₃(CH₂)₄C(=O)OCH₂CH₃.

### Step 2: Calculate the molecular formula
Let's break down the atoms in the molecule:
- Carbon (C): There are 6 carbons in the hexanoic acid part (CCCCCC) and 2 carbons in the ethyl part (CC), so total C = 6 + 2 = 8.
- Hydrogen (H): 
  - In the hexanoic acid chain, CH₃(CH₂)₄C(=O)-, the carbons are arranged as CH₃- (3H), (CH₂)₄ (4 × 2H = 8H), and the carbonyl carbon has no H, so 3 + 8 = 11H for the acid part.
  - In the ethyl group, -OCH₂CH₃, there are 2H on the first carbon and 3H on the second carbon, so 2 + 3 = 5H.
  - Total H = 11 + 5 = 16.
- Oxygen (O): There are 2 oxygen atoms, one in the carbonyl group (=O) and one in the ester linkage (-O-).

Thus, the molecular formula is **C₈H₁₆O₂**.

### Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight
Using standard atomic weights (approximated to common values used in chemistry):
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol × 8 = 96.08 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol × 16 = 16.128 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): 16.00 g/mol × 2 = 32.00 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 96.08 + 16.128 + 32.00 = **144.208 g/mol**

### Step 4: Compare with similar molecules in the dataset
To validate, let's look at similar molecules in the provided list:
- **CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC** (methyl nonanoate, C₁₀H₂₀O₂): 172.268 g/mol. This has 2 more carbons than our molecule (8 vs. 10), and a methyl ester instead of ethyl, so the difference should be roughly 2 × 14 (for 2 CH₂ groups) = 28 g/mol less for our molecule, i.e., 172.268 - 28 ≈ 144 g/mol, which matches.
- **CCOC(=O)C** (ethyl acetate, C₄H₈O₂): 88.106 g/mol (not in the list exactly, but close to **CCOC(=O)N** at 89.094, which is different). Our molecule has 4 more carbons (4 × 14 = 56), so 88 + 56 = 144 g/mol, again consistent.

### Final Prediction
Based on the molecular formula and calculation, the predicted property (molecular weight) for the molecule **CCCCCC(=O)OCC** is approximately **144.21 g/mol**. Rounding to three decimal places as in the dataset, the value is **144.208**.

**Predicted Property Value: 144.208**
==================================================
Iteration: 39
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 393.85400000000016
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I will predict the property value for the molecule with the SMILES notation `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O`. The property values in the given dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they are consistent with the expected molecular weights calculated from the atomic compositions of the molecules. For example:

- `c1ccc2ccccc2c1` (naphthalene) has a property value of 128.174, which matches its molecular weight (C10H8 = 10*12.01 + 8*1.008 = 128.17).
- `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) has a value of 165.834, matching its molecular weight (C2Cl4 = 2*12.01 + 4*35.45 = 165.83).
- `C` (methane, likely intended as CH4) has a value of 16.043, matching CH4 (12.01 + 4*1.008 = 16.042).

Thus, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight of the molecule.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` represents a complex organic molecule. Let's break it down to identify the atoms and structure:

- `CCO` represents an ethoxy group (C2H5O-).
- `P(=S)` indicates a phosphorus atom double-bonded to sulfur.
- `(OCC)` indicates another ethoxy group attached to phosphorus.
- `S` is a sulfur atom.
- `C(CCl)` represents a carbon atom with a chlorine atom attached (likely -CH2Cl since it's a common motif).
- `N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` indicates a nitrogen atom in a cyclic structure, likely part of an imide or phthalimide-like structure (a benzene ring fused with a five-membered ring containing nitrogen and two carbonyl groups).

This molecule appears to be a derivative of a phthalimide structure with a thiophosphate group attached via a sulfur linker and a chlorinated carbon.

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
To predict the molecular weight, I will derive the molecular formula by counting the atoms from the SMILES string:

- **Carbon (C):** 
  - `CCO` contributes 2 carbons.
  - `OCC` contributes 2 carbons.
  - `C(CCl)` contributes 1 carbon.
  - `c1ccccc1` (benzene ring in phthalimide) contributes 6 carbons.
  - Total carbons = 2 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 11.

- **Hydrogen (H):**
  - `CCO` (as C2H5O-) contributes 5 hydrogens (assuming it's ethoxy).
  - `OCC` (as -OC2H5) contributes 5 hydrogens.
  - `C(CCl)` as -CH2Cl contributes 2 hydrogens.
  - `c1ccccc1` in phthalimide contributes 4 hydrogens (since two carbons are part of the imide ring and don't have hydrogens).
  - Total hydrogens = 5 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 16.

- **Oxygen (O):**
  - Two `O` from the ethoxy groups (`CCO` and `OCC`).
  - Two `O` from the carbonyl groups in `C(=O)` and `C2=O`.
  - Total oxygens = 2 + 2 = 4.

- **Nitrogen (N):**
  - One `N` from `N2` in the imide ring.
  - Total nitrogens = 1.

- **Phosphorus (P):**
  - One `P` from `P(=S)`.
  - Total phosphorus = 1.

- **Sulfur (S):**
  - One `S` from `P(=S)`.
  - One `S` from `SC(CCl)`.
  - Total sulfurs = 2.

- **Chlorine (Cl):**
  - One `Cl` from `CCl`.
  - Total chlorines = 1.

Thus, the molecular formula is **C11H16O4NPS2Cl**.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded to three decimal places for consistency with the dataset):
- C: 12.011
- H: 1.008
- O: 15.999
- N: 14.007
- P: 30.974
- S: 32.06
- Cl: 35.45

Molecular weight = (11 * 12.011) + (16 * 1.008) + (4 * 15.999) + (1 * 14.007) + (1 * 30.974) + (2 * 32.06) + (1 * 35.45)
= 132.121 + 16.128 + 63.996 + 14.007 + 30.974 + 64.12 + 35.45
= 356.796

### Step 4: Cross-Check with Dataset Trends
The calculated value of approximately 356.8 fits within the range of molecular weights in the dataset (from 16.043 for methane to 504.438 for a complex sugar derivative). Additionally, comparing to similar molecules in the dataset:
- `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a molecular weight of 367.86, which is close to my calculated value and contains similar functional groups (thiophosphate, sulfur linker, chlorine).
- My molecule has fewer carbons and hydrogens but a similar complexity, so a value around 356 seems reasonable.

### Final Prediction
The predicted property value (molecular weight) for the molecule `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` is **356.796**.

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 289.545
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**. The property values in the dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they are consistent with the calculated molecular weights of the given SMILES strings when considering standard atomic masses (e.g., C=12, H=1, O=16, Cl=35.5, etc.). Therefore, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** represents a molecule with two aromatic rings connected by an oxygen atom (ether linkage). Let's break it down:
- **O**: An oxygen atom, likely part of a hydroxyl group (OH) attached to the first ring.
- **c1cc(Cl)ccc1**: A benzene ring (c1...c1 indicates a ring closure) with a chlorine (Cl) substituent.
- **O**: Another oxygen atom, likely forming an ether linkage between the two rings.
- **c2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl**: A second benzene ring with two chlorine (Cl) substituents.

Thus, the molecule is a diphenyl ether derivative with one hydroxyl group and three chlorine atoms distributed across the two rings.

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
To predict the molecular weight, I need to count the number of each type of atom in the molecule:
- **Carbon (C)**: Each benzene ring has 6 carbon atoms, and there are two rings, so 6 + 6 = 12 carbons.
- **Hydrogen (H)**: A benzene ring (C6H6) has 6 hydrogens, but substituents replace hydrogens:
  - First ring: Starts as C6H6, but has two substituents (OH and O-ether), so 6 - 2 = 4 hydrogens. Additionally, the OH group adds 1 hydrogen, so total for first ring = 4 + 1 = 5 hydrogens.
  - Second ring: Starts as C6H6, has three substituents (O-ether and two Cl), so 6 - 3 = 3 hydrogens.
  - Total hydrogens = 5 (first ring) + 3 (second ring) = 8 hydrogens.
- **Oxygen (O)**: There are two oxygen atoms (one from OH and one from the ether linkage).
- **Chlorine (Cl)**: There are three chlorine atoms (one on the first ring, two on the second ring).

So, the molecular formula is **C12H8O2Cl3**.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using approximate atomic masses (commonly used in chemistry for quick calculations):
- C: 12 g/mol
- H: 1 g/mol
- O: 16 g/mol
- Cl: 35.5 g/mol

Now, calculate:
- Carbon: 12 × 12 = 144
- Hydrogen: 8 × 1 = 8
- Oxygen: 2 × 16 = 32
- Chlorine: 3 × 35.5 = 106.5

Total molecular weight = 144 + 8 + 32 + 106.5 = **290.5 g/mol**

### Step 4: Cross-Check with Similar Molecules in the Dataset
To ensure accuracy, I can compare this molecule to similar ones in the provided dataset:
- **Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl** (molecular weight = 163.003): This is a single benzene ring with one OH and two Cl substituents. Its formula is C6H3OCl2. Calculated: (6×12) + (3×1) + 16 + (2×35.5) = 72 + 3 + 16 + 71 = 162, which matches closely with 163.003.
- **Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2** (molecular weight = 223.102): This is a biphenyl with two Cl substituents. Formula is C12H8Cl2. Calculated: (12×12) + (8×1) + (2×35.5) = 144 + 8 + 71 = 223, which matches.
- My molecule has two rings like biphenyl but includes an ether oxygen and an additional OH group, plus three Cl atoms. The calculated value of 290.5 seems reasonable as it is higher than biphenyl derivatives due to additional oxygen and chlorine atoms.

### Final Prediction
Based on the molecular formula **C12H8O2Cl3** and the calculated molecular weight, I predict the property value (molecular weight) for the molecule **Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl** to be approximately **290.5**.

However, to align with the precision in the dataset (typically three decimal places), and considering slight variations in atomic masses used (e.g., Cl is sometimes approximated as 35.45), I will round it to **290.500** or check if a more precise calculation is needed. Using Cl=35.45:
- Chlorine: 3 × 35.45 = 106.35
- Total = 144 + 8 + 32 + 106.35 = 290.35

Given the dataset values (e.g., 163.003 for C6H3OCl2 suggests Cl≈35.5), I will stick with **290.5**.

Thus, the predicted property value is **290.5**.
==================================================
Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 88.14999999999999
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being described for each molecule is the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) in g/mol. This conclusion is drawn from the consistent correlation between the molecular formulas (represented in SMILES notation) and the numerical values, which match the expected molecular weights of the compounds when calculated manually for several examples. For instance:

- CC(C)O (isopropanol) has a molecular weight of approximately 60.096 g/mol.
- CC#C (propyne) has a molecular weight of approximately 40.065 g/mol.
- C (methane) has a molecular weight of approximately 16.043 g/mol.

Thus, the task is to predict the molecular weight of the molecule CCCOCC, which is represented in SMILES notation.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string CCCOCC represents a linear organic molecule. Breaking it down:
- "C" represents a carbon atom.
- "O" represents an oxygen atom.
- The sequence indicates the connectivity: three carbon atoms (CCC), followed by an oxygen atom (O), followed by two more carbon atoms (CC).

This corresponds to the molecular formula C5H12O, which is likely the structure of dipropyl ether (CH3-CH2-CH2-O-CH2-CH2-CH3).

### Step 2: Calculate the Molecular Weight
To calculate the molecular weight, we sum the atomic masses of all atoms in the molecule:
- Carbon (C): Atomic mass ≈ 12.011 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): Atomic mass ≈ 1.008 g/mol
- Oxygen (O): Atomic mass ≈ 15.999 g/mol

For C5H12O:
- Carbon: 5 atoms × 12.011 = 60.055 g/mol
- Hydrogen: 12 atoms × 1.008 = 12.096 g/mol
- Oxygen: 1 atom × 15.999 = 15.999 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 60.055 + 12.096 + 15.999 = 88.150 g/mol

### Step 3: Cross-Check with Similar Molecules
To ensure accuracy, I can compare this with similar molecules from the provided list:
- CCC(O)CC (pentan-3-ol, C5H12O) has a molecular weight of 88.15 g/mol, which matches our calculation for CCCOCC (also C5H12O, though a different isomer, dipropyl ether). This confirms that the molecular weight should be the same since isomers with the same molecular formula have identical molecular weights.

### Final Prediction
The predicted property value (molecular weight) for the molecule CCCOCC is **88.150 g/mol**. For consistency with the precision in the provided data, I will round it to three decimal places as seen in most examples.

**Predicted Property Value: 88.150**

Iteration: 44
SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 268.36
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being predicted is the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the molecules, as the values correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the given SMILES strings in the examples. For instance, "CCC=O" (propanal) has a value of 58.08, which matches its molecular weight (C3H6O = 58.08 g/mol), and "C" (methane) has a value of 16.043, matching CH4's molecular weight. Therefore, I will predict the molecular weight of the target molecule using my knowledge of chemistry and molecular structure.

The target molecule is given by the SMILES string: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2. Let's break this down to determine its chemical formula and calculate its molecular weight.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
- **CN**: This represents a carbon atom (C) bonded to a nitrogen atom (N), likely indicating a methyl group (CH3) attached to nitrogen, as hydrogens are implied in SMILES.
- **(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)**: This is a branch indicating a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to the nitrogen (N) from the previous part. The carbonyl is also bonded to another nitrogen (N), which is further connected to a tertiary carbon (C(C)(C)) with two methyl groups, and this carbon is bonded to a phenyl ring (c1ccccc1, representing C6H5).
- **c2ccccc2**: This represents a second phenyl ring (C6H5) directly attached to the first nitrogen (N).

Putting it together, the structure is:
- A nitrogen atom (N) connected to:
  1. A methyl group (CH3).
  2. A carbonyl group (C=O), which is also bonded to another nitrogen (NH, implied hydrogen) that connects to a tertiary carbon bearing two methyl groups (C(CH3)2) and a phenyl ring (C6H5).
  3. A second phenyl ring (C6H5).

This suggests the molecule is a urea derivative with the formula resembling (CH3)N(C6H5)C(=O)NH(C(CH3)2C6H5).

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
Let's count the atoms:
- **Carbon (C)**:
  - 1 from the methyl group (CH3 on N).
  - 1 from the carbonyl (C=O).
  - 2 from the two methyl groups on the tertiary carbon (C(CH3)2).
  - 1 from the tertiary carbon itself.
  - 6 from the first phenyl ring (c1ccccc1).
  - 6 from the second phenyl ring (c2ccccc2).
  - Total C = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 6 = 17.
- **Hydrogen (H)**:
  - 3 from the methyl group (CH3 on N).
  - 6 from the two methyl groups on the tertiary carbon (2 × CH3).
  - 5 from the first phenyl ring (C6H5, as it's monosubstituted).
  - 5 from the second phenyl ring (C6H5, as it's monosubstituted).
  - 1 from the NH group (implied in SMILES as NC(=O)).
  - Total H = 3 + 6 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 20.
- **Nitrogen (N)**:
  - 2 nitrogens (one from CN and one from NC(=O)).
- **Oxygen (O)**:
  - 1 oxygen from the carbonyl (C=O).

Thus, the molecular formula is C17H20N2O.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded to three decimal places for consistency with the data):
- C: 12.011 g/mol
- H: 1.008 g/mol
- N: 14.007 g/mol
- O: 15.999 g/mol

Molecular weight = (17 × 12.011) + (20 × 1.008) + (2 × 14.007) + (1 × 15.999)
- C: 17 × 12.011 = 204.187
- H: 20 × 1.008 = 20.160
- N: 2 × 14.007 = 28.014
- O: 1 × 15.999 = 15.999
- Total = 204.187 + 20.160 + 28.014 + 15.999 = 268.360 g/mol

### Step 4: Cross-Check with Similar Molecules
Looking at the provided dataset, molecules with similar structures (e.g., containing phenyl rings, urea-like groups, or tertiary carbons) have molecular weights in a comparable range. For instance:
- CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 has a value of 298.367, which includes two phenyl rings and additional heteroatoms.
- CCOC(=O)CC(=O)OCC is 160.169, a smaller molecule without rings.

My calculated value of 268.360 for C17H20N2O seems reasonable, as it has two phenyl rings (contributing significantly to the mass) and a urea-like structure, fitting between smaller and larger molecules in the dataset.

### Final Prediction
The predicted property (molecular weight) for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is **268.360**.

**Answer: 268.360**

Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 238.159
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2. From the context of the examples, it appears that the property being measured is the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the given SMILES strings.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 represents a specific molecular structure. Let's break it down:
- "O=C2" indicates a carbonyl group (C=O) connected to a carbon (labeled as 2 for ring closure).
- "CN" indicates a carbon-nitrogen bond in the ring.
- "N(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)" indicates a nitrogen atom in the ring, which is connected to another nitrogen via a double bond (N=N), and this second nitrogen is connected to a carbon that is part of a furan-like ring (o1 indicates oxygen in a five-membered ring) with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to the furan ring.
- "C(=O)N2" indicates another carbonyl group connected to a nitrogen, closing the ring at position 2.

This structure appears to be a cyclic compound, likely a hydantoin or imidazolidine-2,4-dione derivative, with a substituent containing a furan ring and a nitro group.

### Step 2: Estimate the Molecular Formula
To predict the molecular weight, I will deduce the approximate molecular formula from the SMILES string:
- The core structure seems to be a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and nitrogens, resembling hydantoin (C3H4N2O2).
- The substituent "N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O" adds a furan ring (C4H3O) with a nitro group (NO2) and a connecting imine (N=C), contributing additional atoms.

Counting the atoms:
- Core ring (hydantoin-like): C3H4N2O2 (but adjust for substitution).
- In the SMILES, "CN(N=...)" suggests one carbon and two nitrogens in the ring, with two carbonyls (O=C...C(=O)), so likely C3N2O2 for the core, with hydrogens adjusted based on substitution.
- Substituent: "N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O" includes:
  - N (imine nitrogen)
  - C (imine carbon)
  - Furan ring: c1ccc(o1) is C4H3O
  - Nitro group: N(=O)=O is NO2
- Total substituent: N + C + C4H3O + NO2 = C5H3N2O3

However, combining with the core, I need to avoid double-counting atoms at connection points. The core nitrogen connects to the imine nitrogen, so the total is approximately:
- Core: C3H2N2O2 (adjusting hydrogens for substitution)
- Substituent: C5H3N2O3
- Total (approximate): C8H5N4O5 (after accounting for connections and valences).

### Step 3: Calculate Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (C=12.01, H=1.008, N=14.01, O=16.00):
- C8: 8 * 12.01 = 96.08
- H5: 5 * 1.008 = 5.04
- N4: 4 * 14.01 = 56.04
- O5: 5 * 16.00 = 80.00
- Total = 96.08 + 5.04 + 56.04 + 80.00 = 237.16

### Step 4: Refine Prediction with Analogy
Looking at the provided dataset, molecules with similar functional groups (nitro groups, cyclic structures, and carbonyls) have molecular weights in a comparable range. For instance:
- OCC1OC(C(O)C1O)n2cnc3c(O)ncnc23 (268.229) has multiple nitrogens and oxygens.
- OC(Cn1cncn1)(c2ccc(F)cc2)c3ccccc3F (301.296) includes nitrogens and aromatic rings.

My calculated value of 237.16 seems reasonable for a molecule with 8 carbons, 4 nitrogens, and 5 oxygens, considering the presence of a nitro group and cyclic structures.

### Step 5: Final Prediction
After cross-checking the atom count and ensuring the structure interpretation aligns with typical molecular weights in the dataset, I predict the property (molecular weight) for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 to be approximately **237.16**.

**Predicted Property Value: 237.16**
==================================================
Iteration: 50
SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: 182.179
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I can infer that the property being described for each molecule is likely the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) in g/mol, as the values correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the given SMILES strings. Molecular weight is a fundamental property of a molecule, determined by summing the atomic masses of all atoms in the molecule, and it matches the pattern of the provided values (e.g., ethyne, C#C, has a value of 26.038, which is very close to its molecular weight of 26.04 g/mol).

Now, I will predict the molecular weight for the target molecule with the SMILES string **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2**. Let's break down the structure and calculate its molecular formula to estimate the molecular weight.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2** describes a cyclic molecule. Let's decode it:
- **O=C2**: A carbonyl group (C=O) where the carbon is labeled as atom 2.
- **N**: A nitrogen atom connected to carbon 2.
- **C(=O)**: Another carbonyl group connected to the nitrogen.
- **C1(CCCC1)**: A cyclopentane ring (five carbons in a ring, labeled as 1, with the first carbon of the ring connected to the previous atom).
- **C(=O)**: Another carbonyl group connected to the cyclopentane carbon.
- **N2**: A nitrogen atom that closes the ring by connecting back to carbon 2.

This structure corresponds to a **barbituric acid derivative** with a cyclopentane ring fused or substituted at one of the carbons. Specifically, it is a six-membered heterocyclic ring with two nitrogens and three carbonyls (a pyrimidine-trione structure) where one carbon of the ring is part of a cyclopentane ring. The molecular formula can be derived as follows:
- The pyrimidine-trione core (without substitution) is C4H2N2O3.
- The cyclopentane ring (C5H10) is integrated such that one carbon is shared with the core, so we add only the additional atoms from the cyclopentane (C4H8, since one carbon is already counted in the core).
- Total formula: C4H2N2O3 (core) + C4H8 (cyclopentane contribution) = **C8H10N2O3**.

### Step 2: Calculate Molecular Weight
Now, calculate the molecular weight based on the formula C8H10N2O3 using approximate atomic masses (C = 12, H = 1, N = 14, O = 16):
- Carbon: 8 × 12 = 96
- Hydrogen: 10 × 1 = 10
- Nitrogen: 2 × 14 = 28
- Oxygen: 3 × 16 = 48
- Total = 96 + 10 + 28 + 48 = **182 g/mol**

### Step 3: Compare with Similar Molecules
To validate, I can compare this molecule to similar structures in the provided dataset:
- **O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC** (SMILES from dataset) has a value of 226.276, which corresponds to a molecular weight of a barbituric acid derivative with additional alkyl chains.
- **O=C1N(COC(=O)CC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3** has a value of 338.363, another barbituric acid derivative with phenyl substitutions.
- My target molecule is simpler, lacking large substituents, so a molecular weight around 182 seems reasonable.

### Final Prediction
Based on the molecular formula C8H10N2O3 and the calculated molecular weight, I predict the property value (molecular weight) for the molecule **O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2** to be approximately **182.18 g/mol**. Using more precise atomic masses (C = 12.011, H = 1.008, N = 14.007, O = 15.999):
- Carbon: 8 × 12.011 = 96.088
- Hydrogen: 10 × 1.008 = 10.08
- Nitrogen: 2 × 14.007 = 28.014
- Oxygen: 3 × 15.999 = 47.997
- Total = 96.088 + 10.08 + 28.014 + 47.997 = **182.179 g/mol**

Thus, the predicted property value is **182.179**.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 257.547
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being described for each molecule is the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) in g/mol. The values given for the example molecules correspond closely to their calculated molecular weights based on their chemical formulas derived from the SMILES notation. Therefore, I will predict the molecular weight for the given molecule: **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl**.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** represents a molecule with two benzene rings connected by a single bond (biphenyl structure), with chlorine atoms substituted at specific positions:
- The first ring (c1ccc(cc1)) is a benzene ring with a chlorine atom attached to one carbon (position 1).
- The second ring (c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl) is another benzene ring with chlorine atoms at two positions (likely positions 2 and 6 relative to the connection point).
- The molecule is a 4,2',6'-trichlorobiphenyl (or similar, depending on exact numbering).

Breaking it down:
- Two benzene rings: C6H5-C6H5 (biphenyl base structure).
- Three chlorine atoms (Cl) are present, replacing hydrogen atoms.

### Step 2: Calculate the Molecular Formula
- Base structure (biphenyl): C12H10 (two benzene rings connected, with 10 hydrogens total).
- Three chlorine atoms replace three hydrogens, so the formula becomes C12H7Cl3.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded to three decimal places for consistency with the provided data):
- Carbon (C): 12.011 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 g/mol
- Chlorine (Cl): 35.453 g/mol

Now, calculate:
- 12 carbons: 12 × 12.011 = 144.132 g/mol
- 7 hydrogens: 7 × 1.008 = 7.056 g/mol
- 3 chlorines: 3 × 35.453 = 106.359 g/mol

Total molecular weight = 144.132 + 7.056 + 106.359 = **257.547 g/mol**

### Step 4: Compare with Similar Molecules in the Dataset
To validate, I can compare this molecule to similar ones in the provided list:
- **Clc1ccccc1Cl** (1,2-dichlorobenzene): 147.004 g/mol (C6H4Cl2)
- **Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl** (a chlorinated biphenyl derivative): 354.491 g/mol (C14H9Cl5)

My calculated value of 257.547 g/mol for C12H7Cl3 fits logically between these, as it has more carbons than dichlorobenzene but fewer substituents and carbons than the more complex chlorinated biphenyl derivative.

### Final Prediction
Based on the molecular formula C12H7Cl3 and the calculated molecular weight, I predict the property value (molecular weight) for the molecule **Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl** to be approximately **257.547 g/mol**. Rounding to three decimal places for consistency with the provided data, the predicted value is **257.547**.

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 288.255
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule `Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3`. From the context of the examples, the property appears to be the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the given SMILES strings in the dataset. Therefore, I will interpret the property as molecular weight and calculate it for the target molecule.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string `Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3` represents a flavonoid-like structure, likely a derivative of quercetin or a similar compound. Let's break it down:
- The string describes a fused ring system with a flavone backbone (two benzene rings connected via a heterocyclic ring with a carbonyl group).
- There are multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups attached to the aromatic rings, as indicated by the "O" symbols.
- The numbering (c1, c2, c3) indicates ring closures and connectivity between the atoms.

This molecule appears to be quercetin, a well-known flavonoid with the molecular formula C₁₅H₁₀O₇.

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
Let's count the atoms based on the SMILES and the implied structure of quercetin:
- **Carbon (C):** 15 atoms (based on the flavone structure with two benzene rings and a central heterocyclic ring).
- **Hydrogen (H):** 10 atoms (accounting for the aromatic hydrogens and adjusting for the hydroxyl groups).
- **Oxygen (O):** 7 atoms (2 in the flavone backbone, including the carbonyl, and 5 from hydroxyl groups).

Thus, the molecular formula is C₁₅H₁₀O₇.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded to three decimal places for consistency with the dataset):
- Carbon: 12.011 g/mol
- Hydrogen: 1.008 g/mol
- Oxygen: 15.999 g/mol

Molecular weight = (15 × 12.011) + (10 × 1.008) + (7 × 15.999)
= 180.165 + 10.080 + 111.993
= 302.238 g/mol

### Step 4: Compare with Dataset Trends
Looking at the provided dataset, the property values align closely with molecular weights. For example:
- `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (glucose, C₆H₁₂O₆) has a value of 180.156, matching its molecular weight.
- `Oc1cccc(O)c1` (catechol, C₆H₆O₂) has a value of 110.112, matching its molecular weight.
- Quercetin-like structures or flavonoids in the dataset, such as `c1cc2ccc(OC)c(CC=C(C)(C))c2oc1=O` (244.29), are consistent with their molecular weights.

Given this, the predicted property value for `Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3` (quercetin) should be approximately 302.238.

### Final Prediction
The predicted property value for the molecule is **302.238**.

Iteration: 56
SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 183.169
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I can infer that the property being described for each molecule is most likely the **molecular weight** (or molar mass) in g/mol, as the values correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the given compounds when considering their chemical formulas.

To predict the property (molecular weight) for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**, I will first interpret the SMILES-like notation to determine the molecular formula, then calculate the molecular weight based on the atomic masses of the constituent atoms.

### Step 1: Interpret the Molecular Structure
The given notation is **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC**. Let's break it down:
- **C**: Carbon atom.
- **O**: Oxygen atom.
- **P**: Phosphorus atom.
- **(=O)**: Indicates a double bond to oxygen, typically attached to phosphorus in this context.
- **N**: Nitrogen atom.
- **(NC(C)=O)**: Suggests an amide group, where nitrogen is bonded to a carbon that is part of an acetyl group (C(C)=O, likely CH3C=O).
- **S**: Sulfur atom.
- **SC**: Likely indicates sulfur bonded to a carbon, probably a methyl group (CH3) given the context of similar structures.

A reasonable interpretation of the structure is:
- Phosphorus (P) is the central atom.
- P is double-bonded to one oxygen (=O).
- P is single-bonded to three groups: 
  - **O-C**, likely a methoxy group (OCH3).
  - **N-C(=O)-C**, likely an acetylamino group (NH-C(=O)-CH3).
  - **S-C**, likely a methylthio group (SCH3).

Thus, the molecular formula can be derived as follows:
- Phosphorus: 1
- Oxygen: 3 (one from =O, one from OCH3, one from C=O in the amide)
- Carbon: 3 (one from OCH3, one from CH3 in SCH3, one from CH3 in the amide + one carbonyl carbon in the amide = 2 carbons, but let's count carefully)
  - OCH3: 1C
  - SCH3: 1C
  - NC(=O)CH3: 2C (one from carbonyl, one from CH3)
  - Total Carbon: 4
- Hydrogen: 
  - OCH3: 3H
  - SCH3: 3H
  - NC(=O)CH3: 3H (from CH3) + 1H (from NH) = 4H
  - Total Hydrogen: 3 + 3 + 4 = 10H
- Nitrogen: 1
- Sulfur: 1

Molecular formula: C4H10NO3PS

### Step 2: Calculate Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic masses (rounded to three decimal places for consistency with the data):
- C: 12.011 g/mol
- H: 1.008 g/mol
- N: 14.007 g/mol
- O: 15.999 g/mol
- P: 30.974 g/mol
- S: 32.06 g/mol

Now, calculate:
- Carbon: 4 × 12.011 = 48.044
- Hydrogen: 10 × 1.008 = 10.08
- Nitrogen: 1 × 14.007 = 14.007
- Oxygen: 3 × 15.999 = 47.997
- Phosphorus: 1 × 30.974 = 30.974
- Sulfur: 1 × 32.06 = 32.06

Total molecular weight = 48.044 + 10.08 + 14.007 + 47.997 + 30.974 + 32.06 = **183.162 g/mol**

### Step 3: Cross-Check with Similar Molecules
Looking at the provided dataset, molecules with similar functional groups (e.g., phosphorus-containing compounds like COP(=S)(OC)OC or COP(=O)(OC)OC) have molecular weights in a comparable range. For instance:
- COP(=S)(OC)OC (likely dimethyl methylphosphonothioate) has a molecular weight around 156 (not in the list exactly, but similar structures like COP(=O)(OC)OC derivatives are around 365.964 when more complex). My calculated value of 183.162 seems reasonable for a smaller phosphorus compound with additional groups.

### Final Prediction
Based on the molecular formula C4H10NO3PS and the calculated molecular weight, I predict the property value for the molecule **COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC** to be approximately **183.162**.

**Predicted Property Value: 183.162**
==================================================
Iteration: 59
SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 372.80800000000016
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being referred to is the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values given correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the molecules represented by their SMILES strings. Molecular weight is a fundamental property in chemistry that can be estimated by summing the atomic masses of the atoms in a molecule, and the provided values are consistent with this interpretation (e.g., CSC corresponds to dimethyl sulfide with a molecular weight of approximately 62.137 g/mol).

Now, I will predict the molecular weight of the target molecule, represented by the SMILES string: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23. To do this, I will break down the SMILES string into its constituent atoms and calculate the approximate molecular weight based on standard atomic masses (rounded to common values for simplicity: C=12, H=1, O=16, N=14, Cl=35.5).

### Step 1: Parse the SMILES String
The SMILES string is: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23

- **OCC(O)CO**: This represents a glycerol-like fragment with an ester linkage. Breaking it down:
  - O (oxygen)
  - C (carbon, likely CH2 since it's a chain)
  - C(O) (carbon with an OH group, likely CH(OH))
  - CO (carbon, likely CH2, connected to oxygen of ester)
- **C(=O)**: Carbonyl group of an ester.
- **c1ccccc1**: Benzene ring (6 carbons, aromatic).
- **N**: Nitrogen, likely an amine linkage.
- **c2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23**: A fused heterocyclic system, likely a quinoline derivative with a chlorine substituent.
  - c2ccnc3: Pyridine ring fused with another ring.
  - cc(Cl)ccc23: Benzene ring with Cl substituent, fused to the pyridine.

### Step 2: Count the Atoms
Let's interpret the structure and count the atoms:
- **Glycerol ester part (OCC(O)CO)**:
  - Carbons: 3 (from glycerol backbone)
  - Hydrogens: 6 (CH2-CH(OH)-CH2, adjusted for ester linkage)
  - Oxygens: 3 (two from OH groups, one from ester linkage)
- **Ester carbonyl (C(=O))**: 
  - Carbon: 1
  - Oxygen: 1 (double-bonded)
- **Benzene ring (c1ccccc1)**:
  - Carbons: 6
  - Hydrogens: 5 (one H replaced by ester, one by N linkage)
- **Nitrogen (N)**: 1
- **Quinoline-like system with Cl (c2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23)**:
  - Carbons: 9 (quinoline has 9 carbons in two fused rings)
  - Hydrogens: 5 (one position substituted by Cl, one by N linkage to benzene)
  - Nitrogen: 1 (in pyridine ring)
  - Chlorine: 1

Total atom count:
- Carbon: 3 (glycerol) + 1 (carbonyl) + 6 (benzene) + 9 (quinoline) = 19
- Hydrogen: 6 (glycerol, adjusted) + 5 (benzene) + 5 (quinoline) = 16
- Oxygen: 3 (glycerol/ester) + 1 (carbonyl) = 4
- Nitrogen: 1 (amine) + 1 (quinoline) = 2
- Chlorine: 1

### Step 3: Calculate Molecular Weight
Using approximate atomic masses:
- C: 12 × 19 = 228
- H: 1 × 16 = 16
- O: 16 × 4 = 64
- N: 14 × 2 = 28
- Cl: 35.5 × 1 = 35.5

Total molecular weight = 228 + 16 + 64 + 28 + 35.5 = 371.5

### Step 4: Refine and Cross-Check
I notice that the SMILES string suggests a specific connectivity (e.g., ester linkage and substitution patterns). Let's double-check the hydrogen count, as aromatic rings and substitutions can be tricky:
- Glycerol part (OCC(O)CO): After esterification, it's -OCH2-CH(OH)-CH2OH, so C3H7O3 (one H less due to ester bond).
- Benzene ring: Substituted at two positions (ester and N), so C6H4.
- Quinoline part: Standard quinoline is C9H7N, but with Cl substitution (replacing one H) and N linkage to benzene (replacing another H), so C9H5NCl.

Recalculating:
- Glycerol ester: C3H7O3
- Carbonyl of ester: CO (but already counted in ester linkage)
- Benzene: C6H4
- Amine: N
- Quinoline-Cl: C9H5NCl

Total:
- C: 3 + 6 + 9 = 18
- H: 7 + 4 + 5 = 16
- O: 3 (from glycerol ester) + 1 (from carbonyl) = 4
- N: 1 + 1 = 2
- Cl: 1

Molecular weight = (18 × 12) + (16 × 1) + (4 × 16) + (2 × 14) + (1 × 35.5) = 216 + 16 + 64 + 28 + 35.5 = 359.5

### Step 5: Final Prediction
After refining the atom count, the molecular weight is approximately 359.5. Given the context of the provided data, where values are often rounded to three decimal places, and considering possible minor errors in hydrogen counting due to SMILES interpretation without software, I will round to a reasonable value. The provided dataset shows molecular weights with three decimal places, so I predict a value close to 359.5.

However, to align with the precision in the dataset and considering I might have missed a hydrogen or substitution, I will check against similar molecules. For instance, complex molecules in the dataset like "CCN(CC)C(=O)C(C)Oc1cccc2ccccc12" have a molecular weight of 271.36, and larger polycyclic systems reach up to 300.36. My calculated value of ~359 seems plausible for a molecule with 18 carbons, multiple heteroatoms, and a chlorine.

Thus, my predicted property value (molecular weight) for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 is **359.500**.

**Final Answer: 359.500**
==================================================
Iteration: 61
SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 267.306
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1**. The property in question appears to be the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values given in the examples are consistent with molecular weights calculated from the molecular formulas derived from the SMILES notations.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES Notation
The SMILES string **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1** represents a molecule. Let's break it down to understand its structure:
- **CC1=**: Indicates a carbon atom (C) connected to a methyl group (C) and part of a ring (denoted by the number 1).
- **C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)**: A carbon atom in the ring is double-bonded to another carbon that is part of a carbonyl group (C(=O)) and connected to a nitrogen (N) which is bonded to a phenyl group (c2ccccc2, a benzene ring).
- **S(=O)(=O)**: A sulfur atom with two double bonds to oxygen atoms, indicating a sulfonyl group (SO₂).
- **CCO1**: Two carbon atoms and an oxygen atom closing the ring (denoted by the number 1, connecting back to the first carbon).

This describes a six-membered heterocyclic ring containing sulfur and oxygen, with a methyl substituent, a sulfonyl group, and an amide linkage to a phenyl group. The ring is likely a 1,2-oxathiin (a six-membered ring with one oxygen and one sulfur), and the sulfonyl group indicates the sulfur is in a higher oxidation state (SO₂).

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
To predict the molecular weight, I will derive the molecular formula by counting the atoms:
- **Carbon (C)**: 
  - From the ring and substituents: CC1=C...CCO1 suggests 4 carbons in the ring structure (two from CC and two from CCO1, but adjusted for ring closure).
  - Ring structure: C1, C (double bond), C (with substituent), C, C, O1 (total 5 carbons in ring + substituents, but let's count explicitly).
  - Methyl group (CC1): 1 carbon.
  - Ring carbons: C1, C=, C(C(=O)...), C (from CCO1), C (from CCO1) = 5 carbons in ring + 1 methyl = 6 carbons.
  - Phenyl group (c2ccccc2): 6 carbons.
  - Total carbons = 6 (ring + methyl) + 6 (phenyl) = 12 carbons.
- **Hydrogen (H)**:
  - Methyl group (CC1): 3 hydrogens.
  - Ring: Need to check saturation. C1 (connected to methyl, likely CH), C= (double bond, no H), C(C(=O)...) (substituted, no H), C (in CCO1, likely CH₂), C (in CCO1, likely CH₂).
    - CH (1 H), CH₂ (2 H), CH₂ (2 H) = 5 hydrogens from ring.
  - Phenyl group: 5 hydrogens (one position substituted by N).
  - Nitrogen in amide (Nc2): 1 hydrogen.
  - Total hydrogens = 3 (methyl) + 5 (ring) + 5 (phenyl) + 1 (amide) = 14 hydrogens.
- **Oxygen (O)**:
  - Ring oxygen (O1): 1 oxygen.
  - Carbonyl in amide (C(=O)): 1 oxygen.
  - Sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)): 2 oxygens.
  - Total oxygens = 1 (ring) + 1 (carbonyl) + 2 (sulfonyl) = 4 oxygens.
- **Nitrogen (N)**: 1 nitrogen from the amide.
- **Sulfur (S)**: 1 sulfur from the sulfonyl group.

Molecular formula: **C₁₂H₁₄N₁O₄S₁**

### Step 3: Calculate Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded to three decimal places for consistency with the data):
- Carbon (C): 12.011 × 12 = 144.132
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 × 14 = 14.112
- Nitrogen (N): 14.007 × 1 = 14.007
- Oxygen (O): 16.000 × 4 = 64.000
- Sulfur (S): 32.06 × 1 = 32.06

Total molecular weight = 144.132 + 14.112 + 14.007 + 64.000 + 32.06 = **268.311**

### Step 4: Cross-Check with Similar Molecules
Looking at the provided data, molecules with similar functional groups (sulfonyl, amide, aromatic rings) have molecular weights in a comparable range:
- **CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O**: 291.265 (contains sulfur, oxygen, nitro group, aromatic ring).
- **CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C**: 345.401 (sulfur, amide-like structure, aromatic ring).

My calculated value of 268.311 seems reasonable for a molecule with a sulfonyl group, an amide, a phenyl ring, and a heterocyclic ring, as it falls within the expected range based on the complexity and atom count.

### Final Prediction
The predicted property value (molecular weight) for the molecule **CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1** is approximately **268.311**.
==================================================
Iteration: 62
SMILES: COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C 
True Property: 346.33900000000017
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the given molecule, which appears to be related to molecular weight (given the context of the numerical values and the SMILES notation of the molecules). The property values in the examples are consistent with molecular weights calculated from the atomic composition of the molecules.

Let's analyze the target molecule: **COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES notation describes the molecular structure. Let's break it down:
- **COC(=O)**: This represents a methyl ester group (–COOCH₃).
- **C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C**: This describes a cyclic structure (likely a pyridine or related heterocycle) with substituents:
  - A methyl group (C) on the ring.
  - A phenyl ring (c2ccccc2) substituted with a nitro group (N(=O)=O).
  - Another methyl ester group (C(=O)OC) on the ring.
- The structure appears to be a dihydropyridine or similar ring system with two ester groups, a methyl substituent, and a nitrophenyl group.

### Step 2: Estimate the Molecular Formula
To predict the molecular weight, I will approximate the molecular formula by counting the atoms:
- **Carbon (C)**: 
  - From COC(=O): 2 (one from CO, one from CH₃).
  - From the second ester C(=O)OC: 2.
  - From the ring C1=C(C)NC=C: approximately 5 carbons in the ring (considering it's a 6-membered ring with one N).
  - From the phenyl ring (c2ccccc2): 6 carbons.
  - From the methyl substituent (C): 1.
  - Total C ≈ 16.
- **Hydrogen (H)**:
  - From COC (CH₃): 3.
  - From the second ester OC (CH₃): 3.
  - From the ring and substituents: estimate based on saturation (dihydropyridine-like structure, phenyl ring, etc.), approximately 9–11 H.
  - Total H ≈ 14 (rough estimate).
- **Oxygen (O)**:
  - From two ester groups (C(=O)OC): 4 (2 per ester).
  - From nitro group (N(=O)=O): 2.
  - Total O = 6.
- **Nitrogen (N)**:
  - From the ring (NC): 1.
  - From the nitro group (N(=O)=O): 1.
  - Total N = 2.

Approximate molecular formula: C₁₆H₁₄N₂O₆ (this is a rough estimate and may need slight adjustment based on exact ring structure and saturation).

### Step 3: Calculate Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (C = 12.01, H = 1.008, N = 14.01, O = 16.00):
- C₁₆: 16 × 12.01 = 192.16
- H₁₄: 14 × 1.008 = 14.11
- N₂: 2 × 14.01 = 28.02
- O₆: 6 × 16.00 = 96.00
- Total ≈ 192.16 + 14.11 + 28.02 + 96.00 = 330.29

### Step 4: Refine Prediction Using Examples
Looking at the provided dataset, molecules with similar complexity (e.g., multiple functional groups, aromatic rings, esters, nitro groups) have molecular weights in the range of 300–400. For instance:
- **CCN2c1nc(N(C)(CCO))ccc1NC(=O)c3cccnc23**: 313.361 (contains multiple nitrogens, oxygen, and rings).
- **CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O**: 335.282 (nitro groups, multiple functional groups).
- **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C**: 316.485 (complex structure with oxygen).

Given the presence of two ester groups, a nitro group, and a heterocyclic ring with a phenyl substituent, the molecular weight should be close to 330–340. My initial calculation of ~330.29 seems reasonable, but I will cross-check the exact structure. The molecule resembles a 1,4-dihydropyridine derivative (common in pharmaceuticals like nifedipine), which often has molecular weights in this range. For example, nifedipine (C₁₇H₁₈N₂O₆) has a molecular weight of 346.33.

Adjusting for the exact structure (likely C₁₇H₁₈N₂O₆ or close), recalculating:
- C₁₇: 17 × 12.01 = 204.17
- H₁₈: 18 × 1.008 = 18.14
- N₂: 2 × 14.01 = 28.02
- O₆: 6 × 16.00 = 96.00
- Total ≈ 346.33

This matches the structure of a typical dihydropyridine with two methyl esters, a nitro-substituted phenyl, and a methyl group on the ring.

### Final Prediction
Based on the analysis and comparison with similar molecules in the dataset, I predict the property value (molecular weight) for the molecule **COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C** to be approximately **346.3**.

**Predicted Property Value: 346.3**
==================================================
Iteration: 70
SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 312.118
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, it appears that the property being predicted is the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the molecules, as the values given correspond closely to the molecular weights of the compounds when calculated manually. The molecular weight is a fundamental property of a molecule, determined by summing the atomic weights of all atoms in the molecule, and it fits the context of the numerical values provided (e.g., 198.134 for Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O, which matches the molecular weight of 2,4-dinitrophenol).

Now, let's predict the molecular weight for the given molecule: **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**. I'll break down the molecular formula by interpreting the SMILES string and calculating the molecular weight step by step using standard atomic weights (C: 12.01, H: 1.008, N: 14.01, O: 16.00, F: 19.00, Cl: 35.45).

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES string
The SMILES string **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O** describes a molecule with:
- A benzene ring (c1cccc(c1)) substituted with a trifluoromethyl group (FC(F)(F)) and a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring.
- The nitrogen (N2) is part of a five-membered lactam ring (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O), where the ring contains two chlorine atoms (one on a carbon as CCl and one on another carbon as C(Cl)) and a carbonyl group (=O).

Breaking it down:
- **FC(F)(F)**: A trifluoromethyl group (-CF₃), contributing 3 F atoms.
- **c1cccc(c1)**: A benzene ring, contributing 6 C atoms and 5 H atoms (since one H is replaced by a substituent).
- **N2**: A nitrogen atom, part of the lactam ring.
- **CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O**: A five-membered ring including the nitrogen (N2), with 4 C atoms, one of which has a -CH₂Cl group (CCl), another with a Cl substituent (C(Cl)), and a carbonyl group (=O). The ring closure at "2" connects back to the nitrogen.
- The benzene ring is connected to the nitrogen of the lactam ring.

### Step 2: Determine the molecular formula
- **Carbon (C)**: 
  - 6 from benzene ring.
  - 1 from -CF₃ group.
  - 4 from the lactam ring (including the carbons in CC(CCl)C(Cl)).
  - Total C = 6 + 1 + 4 = 11.
- **Hydrogen (H)**:
  - Benzene ring: Normally 6 H, but one is replaced by -CF₃ and another by the lactam nitrogen, so 4 H remain on the benzene.
  - Lactam ring: CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O. Let's assign:
    - First C (connected to N): CH₂ (2 H, but one bond to N, so likely CH if part of ring, but in SMILES, it's CC, so interpret as CH₂).
    - Second C: CH (1 H, connected to first C and third C).
    - Third C (CCl): CHCl (1 H, since it's a branch with Cl).
    - Fourth C (C(Cl)): CHCl (1 H, connected to N and third C).
    - However, standard lactam interpretation (e.g., pyrrolidone-like) suggests fewer H due to ring constraints. After ring closure and considering N and =O, it's a 5-membered ring with N-C-C-C-C, where N is tertiary (connected to benzene), so:
      - N (no H).
      - First C after N: CH₂ (2 H).
      - Second C (CCl): CHCl (1 H + Cl branch).
      - Third C (C(Cl)): CHCl (1 H + Cl).
      - Fourth C (carbonyl carbon): C=O (no H).
    - Total H in lactam ring = 2 (from CH₂) + 1 (from CHCl) + 1 (from CHCl) = 4 H.
  - Benzene H = 4.
  - Total H = 4 (benzene) + 4 (lactam) = 8.
- **Nitrogen (N)**: 1 (from N2).
- **Oxygen (O)**: 1 (from =O in lactam).
- **Fluorine (F)**: 3 (from -CF₃).
- **Chlorine (Cl)**: 2 (one from CCl, one from C(Cl)).

So, the molecular formula is **C₁₁H₈N₁O₁F₃Cl₂**.

### Step 3: Calculate the molecular weight
Using approximate atomic weights:
- C: 12.01 × 11 = 132.11
- H: 1.008 × 8 = 8.064
- N: 14.01 × 1 = 14.01
- O: 16.00 × 1 = 16.00
- F: 19.00 × 3 = 57.00
- Cl: 35.45 × 2 = 70.90

Total molecular weight = 132.11 + 8.064 + 14.01 + 16.00 + 57.00 + 70.90 = **298.084**

Rounding to three decimal places (as in the provided data), the predicted molecular weight is approximately **298.084**.

### Step 4: Cross-check with similar molecules
Looking at the provided dataset, molecules with similar functional groups (e.g., chlorine, fluorine, aromatic rings, and nitrogen-containing rings) have molecular weights in a comparable range. For instance:
- **CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl**: 333.604 (contains P, S, Cl, O, aromatic).
- **ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2**: 320.046 (multiple Cl and aromatic rings).
My predicted value of ~298 fits within a reasonable range for a molecule with two Cl, three F, and a smaller ring system.

### Final Prediction
The predicted property (molecular weight) for the molecule **FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O** is **298.084**.

Iteration: 75
SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 327.1230000000001
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O`. The property values in the given dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (in g/mol), as they align closely with the calculated molecular weights of the molecules when considering their structural formulas. Therefore, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight.

### Step 1: Analyze the Target Molecule
The SMILES string `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O` represents a molecule with the following structural features:
- A phenolic ring (benzene ring with an -OH group) substituted with a chlorine atom (Cl) and a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to an amide (-NH-) linkage.
- The amide is connected to a second benzene ring, which is substituted with a chlorine atom (Cl) and a nitro group (-NO2).

Breaking it down:
- `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1`: This represents a benzene ring with an -OH group (phenol) and a Cl substituent.
- `C(=O)N`: This indicates a carbonyl group attached to a nitrogen, forming an amide bond.
- `c2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O`: This represents a second benzene ring with a Cl substituent and a nitro group (-NO2).

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
To predict the molecular weight, I will deduce the molecular formula by counting the atoms in the structure:
- **Carbon (C)**: There are two benzene rings, each with 6 carbons, so 12 carbons total. No additional carbons are present outside the rings.
- **Hydrogen (H)**: 
  - First benzene ring (phenol with Cl and amide substituent): A benzene ring (C6H6) loses 3 hydrogens due to substitutions (-OH, -Cl, and -C(=O)N-), leaving 3H.
  - Second benzene ring (with Cl and -NO2): A benzene ring loses 3 hydrogens due to substitutions (-NH-, -Cl, and -NO2), leaving 3H.
  - The amide group contributes 1H from -NH-.
  - Total H = 3 (first ring) + 3 (second ring) + 1 (amide) = 7H.
- **Oxygen (O)**: 
  - 1 from -OH (phenol).
  - 1 from C=O (amide).
  - 2 from -NO2 (nitro group).
  - Total O = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4O.
- **Nitrogen (N)**: 
  - 1 from the amide (-NH-).
  - 1 from the nitro group (-NO2).
  - Total N = 1 + 1 = 2N.
- **Chlorine (Cl)**: 
  - 1 from the first ring.
  - 1 from the second ring.
  - Total Cl = 2Cl.

Thus, the molecular formula is **C12H7Cl2N2O4**.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded to three decimal places for consistency with the dataset):
- C: 12.011 g/mol
- H: 1.008 g/mol
- O: 15.999 g/mol
- N: 14.007 g/mol
- Cl: 35.453 g/mol

Molecular weight = (12 × 12.011) + (7 × 1.008) + (4 × 15.999) + (2 × 14.007) + (2 × 35.453)
= 144.132 + 7.056 + 63.996 + 28.014 + 70.906
= 314.104 g/mol

### Step 4: Cross-Check with Dataset Trends
Looking at similar molecules in the dataset:
- Molecules with two benzene rings, chlorine substituents, and oxygen/nitrogen-containing groups (e.g., `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl`, property = 289.545) have molecular weights in the range of 250–350 g/mol.
- The presence of nitro groups and amide linkages (e.g., `Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O`, property = 157.556) adds significant mass due to oxygen and nitrogen atoms.
- My calculated value of 314.104 fits within the expected range for a molecule with two rings, two chlorines, and multiple heteroatoms.

### Final Prediction
Based on the molecular formula and calculated molecular weight, I predict the property value (molecular weight) for the molecule `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O` to be approximately **314.10**.

**Predicted Property Value: 314.10**

Iteration: 82
SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 353.4900000000001
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C. Since the property is not explicitly named in the query, I will assume it is a physical or chemical property such as molecular weight, boiling point, or a similar measurable characteristic, as the values provided in the examples (e.g., 96.173, 226.101) suggest a numerical property likely related to molecular mass, boiling point, or a related descriptor.

### Step 1: Analyze the Molecule
The molecule is given in SMILES notation as CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C. Let's break it down to understand its structure:
- **CCCO** and **OCCC**: These represent two propoxy groups (C3H7O-) attached to a central atom.
- **P(=S)**: This indicates a phosphorus atom double-bonded to sulfur, suggesting a thiophosphoryl group.
- **SCC(=O)**: This represents a thioacetate-like linkage with a carbonyl group.
- **N1CCCCC1C**: This is a piperidine ring (a six-membered ring with nitrogen) substituted with a methyl group (C) at one of the carbons.

Overall, this molecule appears to be an organophosphorus compound, likely a pesticide or related compound (e.g., similar to malathion or parathion), with a thiophosphoryl group, ester linkages, and a cyclic amide structure.

### Step 2: Hypothesize the Property
Given the range of values in the provided data (from 42.081 to 390.564), the property could be molecular weight (in g/mol) or boiling point (in °C). Let's first test the hypothesis that the property is molecular weight by calculating it for a few example molecules:
- For CC1=CCCCC1 (cyclohexene), the molecular weight is approximately 82.14 g/mol, but the given value is 96.173, which doesn't match.
- For CCCCCCCI (1-iodooctane), the molecular weight is approximately 240.17 g/mol, but the given value is 226.101, which is close but not exact.
- For CC=C (propene), the molecular weight is 42.08 g/mol, and the given value is 42.081, which matches closely.

Since some values match molecular weight closely (e.g., CC=C) while others do not, the property might not be molecular weight. It could be boiling point or another property. Boiling points for hydrocarbons like CC1=CCCCC1 (cyclohexene) are around 83°C, close to 96.173, suggesting the property might be boiling point in °C.

### Step 3: Estimate Molecular Weight as a Starting Point
Since boiling point prediction without computational tools is challenging and depends on intermolecular forces, functional groups, and molecular weight, I will first calculate the approximate molecular weight of the target molecule to guide the prediction.

- **CCCO**: C3H7O (propoxy) = 59 g/mol
- **OCCC**: Another C3H7O = 59 g/mol
- **P(=S)**: Phosphorus (31) + Sulfur (32) = 63 g/mol
- **SCC(=O)**: S (32) + C (12) + C(=O) (28) = 72 g/mol (approximate)
- **N1CCCCC1C**: Piperidine ring with a methyl substituent = N (14) + 6C (72) + 11H (11) = ~97 g/mol

Total approximate molecular weight = 59 + 59 + 63 + 72 + 97 = ~350 g/mol. Let's calculate precisely:
- Full formula: Count atoms from SMILES CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
  - Carbons: 3 (first CCC) + 3 (second CCC) + 2 (SC) + 7 (piperidine with methyl) = 15C
  - Hydrogens: 7 (first CCCO) + 7 (second OCCC) + 2 (SC) + 11 (piperidine with methyl) = 27H
  - Oxygen: 3 (two O in propoxy, one in C=O)
  - Phosphorus: 1
  - Sulfur: 2 (one in P=S, one in S)
  - Nitrogen: 1
- Molecular formula: C15H27O3PS2N
- Molecular weight = (15*12) + (27*1) + (3*16) + (31) + (2*32) + (14) = 180 + 27 + 48 + 31 + 64 + 14 = 364 g/mol

### Step 4: Compare with Similar Molecules
Looking at the provided data, molecules with similar complexity and molecular weight:
- COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (DDT-like structure), MW ~354 g/mol, property value = 345.653
- CC12CC(=O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO, MW ~360 g/mol, property value = 360.45
- c1(C(=O)OCCCCCC(C)(C))c(C(=O)OCCCCCC(C)(C))cccc1, MW ~390 g/mol, property value = 390.564

If the property is molecular weight, my calculated value of 364 g/mol for the target molecule suggests a property value around 364. However, for some molecules, the property value deviates slightly from molecular weight, and organophosphorus compounds often have boiling points or other properties influenced by polarity and hydrogen bonding.

If the property is boiling point, organophosphorus pesticides like malathion (MW 330 g/mol) have boiling points around 156°C at reduced pressure, but under standard conditions, they decompose before boiling. Given the values in the dataset are higher (e.g., 345–390 for similar MW), it’s likely not boiling point.

### Step 5: Final Prediction
Since many values in the dataset closely match molecular weight (especially for complex molecules), and my calculated molecular weight for CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is approximately 364 g/mol, I will predict the property value to be close to this number. Adjusting for the trend in the dataset where property values sometimes slightly deviate from exact MW (e.g., 345.653 for a molecule with MW ~354), I will predict a value slightly below the calculated MW.

However, to be precise and noting that for some molecules the property matches MW exactly (e.g., 360.45 for MW 360), I will predict:

**Predicted Property Value: 364.0**

This assumes the property is molecular weight or a closely related descriptor. If the property is boiling point or another characteristic, the value might differ, but based on the pattern and my chemical intuition, 364.0 is a reasonable estimate for this organophosphorus compound.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 314.42500000000007
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the molecule with the SMILES notation `CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C`. The property values in the given dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (in g/mol), as they align closely with the calculated molecular weights of the molecules based on their SMILES strings. For instance, methanol (CO) has a property value of 32.042, which matches its molecular weight, and ethene (C=C) has a value of 28.054, also matching its molecular weight. Therefore, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight.

To predict the molecular weight of the target molecule, I will analyze its structure based on the SMILES string and compare it to similar molecules in the dataset, particularly those with steroid-like structures, as the target molecule appears to be a derivative of a steroid backbone with additional functional groups.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string `CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C` describes a complex polycyclic structure, likely a steroid derivative. Let's break it down:
- `CC34` indicates a carbon atom connected to another carbon, with numbers 3 and 4 indicating ring closures.
- `CCC1` and subsequent numbers suggest a series of carbon atoms forming rings, typical of a steroid backbone (four fused rings: three six-membered and one five-membered).
- `C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)` indicates a ring with a ketone group (`=O`) and a hydroxyl group (`O` likely represents `-OH` in this context, as oxygen alone in SMILES often implies a hydroxyl when attached to carbon in such structures).
- `C3CCC4(O)C#C` suggests another ring with a hydroxyl group (`O`) and a terminal alkyne (`C#C`).

This structure resembles a steroid nucleus (like testosterone or cortisol derivatives) with two hydroxyl groups and an alkyne substituent.

### Step 2: Identify Similar Molecules in the Dataset
Looking at the dataset, several molecules have steroid-like structures with similar SMILES patterns and property values (molecular weights):
- `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` has a property value of 288.431 g/mol. This appears to be a steroid with a ketone and a hydroxyl group, likely testosterone or a similar compound (C19H28O2, calculated MW ≈ 288.42 g/mol).
- `CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO` has a property value of 392.467 g/mol, likely a corticosteroid like dexamethasone (C22H29FO5, calculated MW ≈ 392.46 g/mol).
- `CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` has a property value of 330.468 g/mol, possibly a derivative like cortisone (C21H30O4, calculated MW ≈ 330.46 g/mol).

These examples confirm that the property is molecular weight and that steroid derivatives in the dataset have molecular weights ranging from approximately 288 to 392 g/mol, depending on substituents like hydroxyls, ketones, and halogens.

### Step 3: Estimate the Molecular Formula of the Target Molecule
To predict the molecular weight, I will estimate the molecular formula of `CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C`:
- **Steroid backbone**: A typical steroid nucleus (like cholesterol without side chains) has a formula of C17H28 (four fused rings). However, based on the SMILES and comparison to testosterone (C19H28O2), the base structure likely includes additional carbons in the rings or side chains.
- Counting carbons in the SMILES string:
  - `CC34` → 2 carbons.
  - `CCC1` → 3 carbons.
  - `C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)` → 7 carbons (CCC2, C, C, CCC12).
  - `C3CCC4(O)C#C` → 5 carbons (C3, CCC4, C#C).
  - Total carbons ≈ 17–19, consistent with a steroid backbone (likely C19 as in testosterone).
- **Oxygen atoms**: Two `O` atoms in the SMILES, likely representing hydroxyl groups (`-OH`), and one `=O` (ketone), so 3 oxygen atoms total.
- **Hydrogen atoms**: In steroids, hydrogens adjust based on saturation and functional groups. For C19 with two `-OH` and one `=O`, the formula might be close to C19H28O3 (similar to testosterone C19H28O2 but with an extra oxygen).
- **Alkyne group (`C#C`)**: Adds 2 carbons, likely as `-C≡CH`, contributing C2H.

Tentative molecular formula:
- Base steroid (like testosterone): C19H28O2.
- Extra hydroxyl: +O, -H (since `-OH` replaces a hydrogen).
- Alkyne (`-C≡CH`): +C2H.
- Adjusted formula: C21H29O3 (C19 + C2, H28 + H1 - H2 for functional groups, O2 + O1).

Calculating molecular weight for C21H30O3 (adjusting hydrogens for proper valency):
- C: 21 × 12.011 = 252.231
- H: 30 × 1.008 = 30.24
- O: 3 × 15.999 = 47.997
- Total ≈ 330.468 g/mol

This matches the molecular weight of a similar compound in the dataset (`CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C`, 330.468 g/mol), which also has a C21H30O4-like structure.

However, rechecking the SMILES, the alkyne is `C#C`, likely `-C≡CH`, and the base structure may have fewer hydrogens due to unsaturation. Comparing to `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O` (C19H28O2, 288.431 g/mol), adding `C2H` (alkyne) and one `O` (hydroxyl) suggests:
- C19H28O2 → C21H29O3 (adding C2H and O, adjusting H for valency).
- Recalculated MW for C21H28O3 (steroid unsaturation reduces H):
  - C: 21 × 12.011 = 252.231
  - H: 28 × 1.008 = 28.224
  - O: 3 × 15.999 = 47.997
  - Total ≈ 328.452 g/mol

### Step 4: Final Prediction
Given the similarity to other steroid derivatives and the calculated molecular weight, I predict the property value (molecular weight) for the molecule `CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C` to be approximately **328.45 g/mol**. This accounts for a C21H28O3 formula, consistent with a steroid backbone, two hydroxyls, one ketone, and a terminal alkyne.

**Predicted Property Value: 328.45**

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 588.5620000000001
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the given molecule. From the context of the examples, it appears that the property being measured is likely the molecular weight (or molar mass) of the compounds, as the values correspond closely to the calculated molecular weights of the molecules described by their SMILES strings.

The molecule in question is represented by the SMILES string: `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67`. This string describes a complex organic molecule, likely a natural product or derivative with multiple rings, ether linkages, and hydroxyl groups, possibly resembling a flavonoid glycoside or a similar structure.

To predict the molecular weight, I will break down the SMILES string into its constituent parts to estimate the molecular formula and calculate the approximate molar mass. Let's analyze the structure:

1. **Core Structure Analysis**:
   - The SMILES string indicates a central aromatic ring with methoxy (`CO`) and hydroxy (`O`) substituents.
   - There are additional cyclic structures, including a lactone-like moiety (`COC2=O`), a sugar-like moiety (`OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O`), and a fused ring system with a methylenedioxy group (`OCOc5`).
   - The molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic compound with oxygen-containing functional groups, likely a glycosylated flavonoid or a related natural product.

2. **Approximate Atom Count**:
   - From the SMILES string, I can infer the presence of multiple carbon atoms (likely around 25–30), oxygen atoms (around 10–12), and hydrogen atoms (around 20–25). There are no indications of nitrogen, halogens, or other heteroatoms beyond oxygen.
   - The sugar moiety (`OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O`) suggests a hexose sugar derivative (like glucose or a similar sugar), which typically contributes around 6 carbons and 5–6 oxygens.
   - The core structure with `C6C2C` and fused rings suggests a flavonoid-like backbone with additional oxygen-containing rings.

3. **Molecular Weight Estimation**:
   - A typical flavonoid backbone (like quercetin or kaempferol) has a molecular weight of around 300–320 g/mol (e.g., C15H10O7 for quercetin is 302.24 g/mol).
   - Adding a sugar moiety (like a hexose, C6H12O6, minus water for glycosidic linkage, roughly 162 g/mol) would increase the weight by approximately 150–160 g/mol.
   - Additional methoxy groups (`CO`, adding about 31 g/mol each) and the methylenedioxy group (`OCO`, adding about 44 g/mol) contribute further to the mass.
   - Summing these up: flavonoid core (~300) + sugar (~160) + 2 methoxy groups (~62) + methylenedioxy (~44) suggests a molecular weight in the range of 550–600 g/mol.

4. **Comparison with Training Data**:
   - Looking at the provided data, complex molecules with multiple rings and oxygen atoms, such as `C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21` (molecular weight 414.63), are lighter because they lack a sugar moiety.
   - The target molecule has additional complexity due to the sugar and substituents, so its molecular weight should be higher than 414.63 but likely less than 600, given the compact nature of the fused rings.

5. **Final Prediction**:
   - Based on the structural analysis and comparison with similar molecules in the dataset, I estimate the molecular weight of the given molecule to be approximately **542.5 g/mol**. This value accounts for a flavonoid-like core, a sugar moiety, and the additional substituents (methoxy and methylenedioxy groups).

Thus, the predicted property value (molecular weight) for the molecule `COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67` is **542.5**.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 588.5620000000001
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data and my expertise in molecular structures, I will predict the property value for the given molecule. The property values in the examples appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the compounds, as they align closely with the calculated molecular weights of the molecules when interpreted via their SMILES notation. For instance, CCC(C)(C)CO (2-methyl-2-butanol) has a listed value of 102.177, which matches its approximate molecular weight (C6H14O = 102.17 g/mol), and C#C (ethyne) has a value of 26.038, matching its molecular weight (C2H2 = 26.04 g/mol). Therefore, I will assume the property to predict is the molecular weight of the molecule.

The molecule in question is represented by the SMILES string: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67. This is a complex organic molecule, likely a natural product or derivative with multiple rings and functional groups, possibly related to flavonoids or lignans with sugar moieties.

To predict the molecular weight, I will break down the SMILES string into its constituent atoms by interpreting the structure:

1. **Parse the SMILES string**: The string describes a molecule with aromatic rings, ether linkages, hydroxyl groups, and a sugar-like moiety. It includes:
   - Methoxy groups (CO, OC)
   - Phenolic hydroxyl (O)
   - Aromatic rings (c1, c2, etc.)
   - A lactone or cyclic ester (COC2=O)
   - A sugar moiety (OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)
   - Additional fused rings with ether bridges (OCOc5)

2. **Estimate the molecular formula**: By carefully counting the atoms from the SMILES string (though this is an approximation without computational tools), I interpret the structure as follows:
   - The core structure appears to be a lignan or flavonoid-like scaffold with multiple oxygen-containing functional groups.
   - The sugar moiety (likely a hexose derivative) contributes approximately C6H12O6 or a modified version.
   - The presence of multiple methoxy (OCH3) and hydroxyl (OH) groups adds to the oxygen count.
   - The aromatic and aliphatic carbons form the backbone.

   After a rough count:
   - Carbons: Approximately 25–30 (considering the aromatic rings, sugar, and aliphatic chains).
   - Hydrogens: Approximately 20–30 (accounting for aromatic hydrogens, sugar hydrogens, and methoxy groups).
   - Oxygens: Approximately 10–12 (from methoxy, hydroxyl, ether, and carbonyl groups).

   A plausible molecular formula might be around C27H28O11 (as an educated guess based on similar natural products like glycosylated flavonoids or lignans).

3. **Calculate the approximate molecular weight**:
   - C27: 27 × 12 = 324
   - H28: 28 × 1 = 28
   - O11: 11 × 16 = 176
   - Total = 324 + 28 + 176 = 528 g/mol

4. **Compare with similar molecules in the dataset**: Looking at the provided examples, complex molecules with sugar moieties and multiple rings have molecular weights in the range of 300–400 g/mol (e.g., OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O at 342.297, a disaccharide). My estimated formula yields a higher value, which is reasonable given the additional aromatic rings and functional groups in the target molecule. Adjusting for a slightly lower carbon or oxygen count (e.g., C25H26O10), the molecular weight would be:
   - C25: 25 × 12 = 300
   - H26: 26 × 1 = 26
   - O10: 10 × 16 = 160
   - Total = 300 + 26 + 160 = 486 g/mol

5. **Final prediction**: Given the complexity of the molecule and comparing it to the dataset (where the highest molecular weight is 380.444 for a molecule with two phenyl rings and fewer oxygens), I believe the molecular weight should be in the range of 450–500 g/mol. Fine-tuning based on the structural complexity and the presence of a glycoside-like moiety, I will predict a value closer to the middle of this range.

**Predicted property value (molecular weight): 486.5**

This is an approximation based on my interpretation of the SMILES string and comparison with the provided dataset. Without computational tools to confirm the exact molecular formula, this value reflects my best estimate as an experienced chemist.

Iteration: 97
SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 214.294
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided data, I will predict the property for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**. The property values in the given dataset appear to correspond to molecular weights (or molar masses) of the molecules, as they are consistent with the calculated molar masses for many of the provided SMILES strings when considering standard atomic weights (e.g., C=12, H=1, O=16, N=14, Cl=35.5, etc.). For instance:

- **c1ccccc1O** (phenol) has a property value of 94.113, which matches its molecular weight (C6H6O = 6*12 + 6*1 + 16 = 94).
- **CO** (methanol) has a property value of 32.042, which matches its molecular weight (CH4O = 12 + 4*1 + 16 = 32).
- **CC(C)Br** (isopropyl bromide) has a property value of 122.993, which is close to its molecular weight (C3H7Br = 3*12 + 7*1 + 80 ≈ 123).

Thus, I will assume the property being predicted is the **molecular weight** of the molecule.

### Step 1: Interpret the SMILES String
The SMILES string for the target molecule is **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**. Let's break it down to determine the molecular formula:

- **CS**: This represents a carbon atom (C) bonded to a sulfur atom (S), likely as a methylthio group (CH3-S-).
- **c1nnc**: This indicates a ring structure starting with a carbon atom (c1), followed by two nitrogen atoms (n, n), and another carbon atom (c) that closes the ring (indicated by the number 1). This suggests a 1,2,3-triazole or similar heterocyclic ring.
- **(c(=O)n1N)**: This indicates a carbonyl group (c=O) attached to the ring carbon, and the ring is closed with a nitrogen (n1) that has an additional nitrogen (N) attached, likely indicating a hydrazine-like structure or part of a larger heterocycle. This suggests the ring is a 1,2,4-triazole or tetrazole derivative with a carbonyl group.
- **C(C)(C)C**: This represents a tert-butyl group (C(CH3)3), attached to the ring.

After careful interpretation, the structure appears to be a 1,2,3,4-tetrazole or similar ring with a methylthio group (CH3S-), a carbonyl group, and a tert-butyl group as substituents. The exact ring structure is a bit ambiguous due to the SMILES notation, but I interpret it as a tetrazolone-like structure (a tetrazole ring with a carbonyl).

### Step 2: Determine the Molecular Formula
Let's count the atoms based on the SMILES string:

- **Carbon (C)**:
  - 1 from "CS" (methyl group).
  - 2 in the ring (c1 and c in "nnc").
  - 1 from the carbonyl "c(=O)".
  - 4 from the tert-butyl group "C(C)(C)C" (1 central C + 3 methyl C's).
  - Total C = 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 8.

- **Hydrogen (H)**:
  - 3 from the methyl group in "CS" (CH3-S-).
  - 9 from the tert-butyl group "C(C)(C)C" (3 methyl groups, each with 3 H).
  - No additional H on the ring due to aromaticity or substitution.
  - Total H = 3 + 9 = 12.

- **Nitrogen (N)**:
  - 2 from "nn" in the ring.
  - 1 from "n1" in the ring.
  - 1 from "N" attached to the ring.
  - Total N = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4.

- **Sulfur (S)**:
  - 1 from "CS".

- **Oxygen (O)**:
  - 1 from the carbonyl "c(=O)".

Thus, the molecular formula is **C8H12N4OS**.

### Step 3: Calculate the Molecular Weight
Using standard atomic weights (rounded for simplicity, as the provided data seems to use precise values):
- C: 12.011 * 8 = 96.088
- H: 1.008 * 12 = 12.096
- N: 14.007 * 4 = 56.028
- O: 15.999 * 1 = 15.999
- S: 32.06 * 1 = 32.06

Total molecular weight = 96.088 + 12.096 + 56.028 + 15.999 + 32.06 ≈ **212.271**

### Step 4: Cross-Check with Dataset Trends
Looking at similar molecules in the dataset with sulfur, nitrogen, and oxygen:
- **CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C** has a property value of 256.331, which includes a tert-butyl group, sulfur, and multiple nitrogens, similar to our molecule. Its higher value suggests additional atoms or heavier groups, which aligns with our lower prediction since our molecule has fewer atoms.
- **CCNc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(OC)n1** has a value of 211.269, which is very close to our prediction, and it also contains multiple nitrogens and an oxygen, supporting our estimate.

### Final Prediction
Based on the molecular formula **C8H12N4OS** and the calculated molecular weight, I predict the property value for the molecule **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C** to be approximately **212.27**.

**Predicted Property Value: 212.27**
