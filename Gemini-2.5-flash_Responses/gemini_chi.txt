SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 2.7276303120368004
Predicted Property:
I will analyze the provided examples to discern patterns between molecular structures and their associated property values. I'll pay close attention to the types of atoms present, the functional groups, the overall size and complexity of the molecules, and any recurring structural motifs.

For the target molecule, FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, I will break down its structure: a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) attached to a benzene ring. I will consider the electronegativity of fluorine, its impact on electron distribution, and the steric bulk of the trifluoromethyl group. I will then compare these features to the examples provided, looking for molecules with similar characteristics or fragments.

For instance, I'll look for:
*   Molecules with aromatic rings.
*   Molecules with halogens (especially fluorine, if present, or other halogens to infer trends).
*   Molecules with alkyl chains or other simple substituents to understand their baseline contributions.
*   Molecules with electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups.

Given the presence of the highly electronegative fluorine atoms and the aromatic ring, I anticipate a property value that reflects these features. The trifluoromethyl group is known to be strongly electron-withdrawing.

Let's re-examine the examples:
*   `Clc1ccc(I)cc1`, 3.6560453 (Halogens on benzene)
*   `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`, 6.9670644 (Multiple halogens, larger system)
*   `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`, 5.99385458 (Multiple halogens, larger system)
*   `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1`, 3.02695451 (Halogen on benzene with -OH)
*   `COc1ccccc1O`, 2.6633295 (Oxygen on benzene)
*   `Cc1ccccc1C`, 2.68714749 (Methyl on benzene)
*   `CCc1ccccc1CC`, 3.94867061 (Ethyl on benzene)
*   `C1CCCC1`, 2.5 (Cycloalkane)
*   `CCCCC`, 2.41421356 (Alkane)

The target molecule, FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, has a benzene ring and a trifluoromethyl group. The trifluoromethyl group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, and the presence of three fluorine atoms will significantly influence the molecule's properties compared to simple alkyl or single halogen substitutions.

Comparing to `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (3.656) or `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (3.026), the trifluoromethyl group is more complex and has a stronger electronic effect than a single halogen. The values for simple benzene derivatives with alkyl groups are lower (e.g., 2.687 for xylene, 3.948 for diethylbenzene).

The property seems to increase with complexity, size, and the presence of certain functional groups or highly electronegative atoms. The trifluoromethyl group is quite polar and bulky.

Considering the examples, a single halogen on a benzene ring gives values around 3-4. The trifluoromethyl group is more substantial and more electron-withdrawing than a single chlorine or bromine. Therefore, I expect the value to be higher than that of a simple halobenzene.

Let's consider the impact of multiple halogens or more complex structures. For instance, `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of 7.76, which is much higher due to its complexity and multiple halogens.

The molecule `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` is a fluorinated benzene derivative. It's more complex than a simple halobenzene but less so than the large, multi-halogenated examples. The trifluoromethyl group is a significant substituent.

Based on the trend that more complex and more polar/electron-withdrawing groups tend to increase the property value, and comparing it to the values for simple halobenzenes (around 3-4), I would estimate a value somewhat higher than these, but not as high as the very large, multi-halogenated, or phosphorus-containing compounds.

A reasonable prediction would be in the range of 4 to 5, reflecting the increased complexity and electronegativity

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 3.6142465196979408
Predicted Property:
I will use my knowledge of molecular structures and their properties to predict the value. The provided examples show a correlation between molecular complexity, the presence of polar groups, and the magnitude of the property. Aromatic rings, nitro groups, and amide linkages tend to increase the value.

The molecule `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O` contains:
- An aromatic ring (benzene).
- A nitro group (-N(=O)=O), which is highly polar and electron-withdrawing.
- An amide group (-C(=O)N-), which is also polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
- A methyl group (-CH3) and a carbonyl group (-C=O).

Comparing this to the examples:
- `O=N(=O)c1ccccc1` has a value of 2.499. Our molecule has an additional amide group and a methyl group.
- `COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O` has a value of 3.028. Our molecule has an amide instead of an ether, and the amide is directly attached to the ring, which might increase polarity.
- `O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O` has a value of 4.655. This molecule has a nitro group and a more complex heterocyclic system with an amide-like structure.

The presence of both a nitro group and an amide group on the benzene ring suggests a higher polarity and potentially a higher value than simple nitrobenzenes or amides. The conjugation between the nitro group, the benzene ring, and the amide group will also contribute to the overall electronic properties.

Considering the examples, the value should be significantly higher than simple nitrobenzene (2.499) and likely higher than methoxynitrobenzene (3.028) due to the strong polarity of the amide group. It might be in a similar range to molecules with multiple polar functionalities or larger structures.

Let's consider the contributions:
- Benzene ring: Base value.
- Nitro group: Significant increase.
- Amide group: Significant increase.

The combination of these strong polar groups on a relatively small aromatic core suggests a value in the mid-range of the provided examples, possibly around 4-5.

Final prediction: 4.15

The final answer is $\boxed{4.15}$

Predicted Property:
I will predict the property for the molecule CCCOC=O.

The provided examples show a correlation between molecular size/complexity, the presence of polar groups, and the property value.

Let's analyze the given molecule: CCCOC=O (Propyl acetate).
It has 6 carbons, 2 oxygens, and 10 hydrogens. It contains an ester functional group.

Comparing it to similar molecules in the examples:
*   **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate): Property 3.76407255. This molecule is significantly larger and more complex due to the benzene ring and amino group.
*   **CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O**: Property 5.39556183. This is also much larger and more complex.
*   **CC(=O)CCC1C(=O)N(N(C1=O)c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3**: Property 7.86731878. Much larger.
*   **NC(=O)N**: Property 0.78147441. Much smaller.
*   **CC#N**: Property 0.7236068. Much smaller.
*   **CCC#C**: Property 1.34933531. Similar carbon count, but different functional group (alkyne).
*   **CCCC(O)CC**: Property 2.98890903. Similar carbon count, but an alcohol.
*   **CC(O)c1ccccc1**: Property 3.0349079. Larger due to benzene ring.

The molecule CCCOC=O is a relatively small organic molecule with a polar ester group. Its size is comparable to molecules like CCC(O)CC (2.98890903) or CC(O)c1ccccc1 (3.0349079) in terms of non-hydrogen atoms, but the ester group might contribute differently.

Esters are generally more polar than simple alkanes or alcohols of similar size, but less polar than highly functionalized aromatic compounds. The property values seem to increase with molecular size and complexity, and also with the presence of certain functional groups.

Considering the size and the ester group, it should be higher than very small molecules like nitriles or ureas, but lower than large aromatic or highly substituted compounds.

Let's consider the "CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1" (3.76) example. Our molecule is simpler, lacking the benzene ring and amino group. This suggests our value should be lower than 3.76.

Let's consider "CCC(O)CC" (2.9889). Our molecule has an ester, which is generally more polar and has a higher molecular weight than a simple alcohol of similar carbon count. This might suggest a slightly higher value than 2.9889.

Given the examples, the property seems to be related to a combination of molecular size (number of heavy atoms) and the nature of the functional groups (polarity, aromaticity, branching).

For CCCOC=O (Propyl acetate), it has 6 heavy atoms (3 C, 2 O, 1 C in carbonyl).
For CCC(O)CC (Hexan-3-ol), it has 6 heavy atoms (6 C, 1 O).
For CC(O)c1ccccc1 (1-Phenylethanol), it has 8 heavy atoms (8 C, 1 O).

The value for CCC(O)CC is 2.98890903. Propyl acetate has a similar number of heavy atoms but a different functional group. Esters are generally more volatile than alcohols of similar molecular weight, but this property might not directly correlate with volatility.

Let's look at the range of values for small to medium-sized molecules:
*   C1CCCCCC1 (cyclohexane): 3.5 (6 carbons, cyclic)
*   Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 (4-bromophenol): 3.02695451 (aromatic, polar)
*   CC(O)c1ccccc1 (1-phenylethanol): 3.0349079 (aromatic, alcohol)
*   CCCI (1-iodopropane): 2.9999497 (3 carbons, heavy halogen)
*   c2ccc1

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 2.7276303120368004
Predicted Property:
I will analyze the provided examples to discern patterns between molecular structures and their associated property values. I'll pay close attention to the types of atoms present, the functional groups, the overall size and complexity of the molecules, and any recurring structural motifs.

For the target molecule, FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, I will break down its structure: a trifluoromethyl group (-CF3) attached to a benzene ring. I will consider the electronegativity of fluorine, its impact on electron distribution, and the steric bulk of the trifluoromethyl group. I will then compare these features to the examples provided, looking for molecules with similar characteristics or fragments.

For instance, I'll look for:
*   Molecules with aromatic rings.
*   Molecules with halogens (especially fluorine, if present, or other halogens to infer trends).
*   Molecules with alkyl chains or other simple substituents to understand their baseline contributions.
*   Molecules with electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups.

Given the presence of the highly electronegative fluorine atoms and the aromatic ring, I anticipate a property value that reflects these features. The trifluoromethyl group is known to be strongly electron-withdrawing.

Let's re-examine the examples:
*   `Clc1ccc(I)cc1`, 3.6560453 (Halogens on benzene)
*   `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl`, 6.9670644 (Multiple halogens, larger system)
*   `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl`, 5.99385458 (Multiple halogens, larger system)
*   `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1`, 3.02695451 (Halogen on benzene with -OH)
*   `COc1ccccc1O`, 2.6633295 (Oxygen on benzene)
*   `Cc1ccccc1C`, 2.68714749 (Methyl on benzene)
*   `CCc1ccccc1CC`, 3.94867061 (Ethyl on benzene)
*   `C1CCCC1`, 2.5 (Cycloalkane)
*   `CCCCC`, 2.41421356 (Alkane)

The target molecule, FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, has a benzene ring and a trifluoromethyl group. The trifluoromethyl group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, and the presence of three fluorine atoms will significantly influence the molecule's properties compared to simple alkyl or single halogen substitutions.

Comparing to `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` (3.656) or `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` (3.026), the trifluoromethyl group is more complex and has a stronger electronic effect than a single halogen. The values for simple benzene derivatives with alkyl groups are lower (e.g., 2.687 for xylene, 3.948 for diethylbenzene).

The property seems to increase with complexity, size, and the presence of certain functional groups or highly electronegative atoms. The trifluoromethyl group is quite polar and bulky.

Considering the examples, a single halogen on a benzene ring gives values around 3-4. The trifluoromethyl group is more substantial and more electron-withdrawing than a single chlorine or bromine. Therefore, I expect the value to be higher than that of a simple halobenzene.

Let's consider the impact of multiple halogens or more complex structures. For instance, `COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl` has a value of 7.76, which is much higher due to its complexity and multiple halogens.

The molecule `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` is a fluorinated benzene derivative. It's more complex than a simple halobenzene but less so than the large, multi-halogenated examples. The trifluoromethyl group is a significant substituent.

Based on the trend that more complex and more polar/electron-withdrawing groups tend to increase the property value, and comparing it to the values for simple halobenzenes (around 3-4), I would estimate a value somewhat higher than these, but not as high as the very large, multi-halogenated, or phosphorus-containing compounds.

A reasonable prediction would be in the range of 4 to 5, reflecting the increased complexity and electronegativity compared to a single halogen, but not reaching the values of highly substituted or very large molecules.

Let's refine this. `Clc1ccc(I)cc1` is 3.656. `Oc1ccc(Br)cc1` is 3.026. The trifluoromethyl group is more electron-withdrawing and has three fluorines. This should push the value higher than a single halogen.

I'll consider the effect of the three fluorines. Each fluorine is highly electronegative. The combined effect of three fluorines directly attached to a carbon, which is then attached to the benzene ring, will significantly alter the electronic properties of the molecule.

Given the examples, the property value seems to be related to the molecular size, polarity, and the presence of specific functional groups. The trifluoromethyl group is a strong electron-withdrawing group and adds significant polarity.

I'll estimate a value that reflects this increased polarity and electron-withdrawing nature compared to a single halogen, but not as high as very large or highly functionalized molecules.

My prediction is **4.35**.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 1.9671864365723921
Predicted Property:
I will predict the property for the molecule CCCOC=O.

The provided examples show a correlation between molecular size/complexity, the presence of polar groups, and the property value.

Let's analyze the given molecule: CCCOC=O (Propyl acetate).
It has 6 carbons, 2 oxygens, and 10 hydrogens. It contains an ester functional group.

Comparing it to similar molecules in the examples:
*   **CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1** (Ethyl 4-aminobenzoate): Property 3.76407255. This molecule is significantly larger and more complex due to the benzene ring and amino group.
*   **CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O**: Property 5.39556183. This is also much larger and more complex.
*   **CC(=O)CCC1C(=O)N(N(C1=O)c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3**: Property 7.86731878. Much larger.
*   **NC(=O)N**: Property 0.78147441. Much smaller.
*   **CC#N**: Property 0.7236068. Much smaller.
*   **CCC#C**: Property 1.34933531. Similar carbon count, but different functional group (alkyne).
*   **CCCC(O)CC**: Property 2.98890903. Similar carbon count, but an alcohol.
*   **CC(O)c1ccccc1**: Property 3.0349079. Larger due to benzene ring.

The molecule CCCOC=O is a relatively small organic molecule with a polar ester group. Its size is comparable to molecules like CCC(O)CC (2.98890903) or CC(O)c1ccccc1 (3.0349079) in terms of non-hydrogen atoms, but the ester group might contribute differently.

Esters are generally more polar than simple alkanes or alcohols of similar size, but less polar than highly functionalized aromatic compounds. The property values seem to increase with molecular size and complexity, and also with the presence of certain functional groups.

Considering the size and the ester group, it should be higher than very small molecules like nitriles or ureas, but lower than large aromatic or highly substituted compounds.

Let's consider the "CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1" (3.76) example. Our molecule is simpler, lacking the benzene ring and amino group. This suggests our value should be lower than 3.76.

Let's consider "CCC(O)CC" (2.9889). Our molecule has an ester, which is generally more polar and has a higher molecular weight than a simple alcohol of similar carbon count. This might suggest a slightly higher value than 2.9889.

Given the examples, the property seems to be related to a combination of molecular size (number of heavy atoms) and the nature of the functional groups (polarity, aromaticity, branching).

For CCCOC=O (Propyl acetate), it has 6 heavy atoms (3 C, 2 O, 1 C in carbonyl).
For CCC(O)CC (Hexan-3-ol), it has 6 heavy atoms (6 C, 1 O).
For CC(O)c1ccccc1 (1-Phenylethanol), it has 8 heavy atoms (8 C, 1 O).

The value for CCC(O)CC is 2.98890903. Propyl acetate has a similar number of heavy atoms but a different functional group. Esters are generally more volatile than alcohols of similar molecular weight, but this property might not directly correlate with volatility.

Let's look at the range of values for small to medium-sized molecules:
*   C1CCCCCC1 (cyclohexane): 3.5 (6 carbons, cyclic)
*   Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 (4-bromophenol): 3.02695451 (aromatic, polar)
*   CC(O)c1ccccc1 (1-phenylethanol): 3.0349079 (aromatic, alcohol)
*   CCCI (1-iodopropane): 2.9999497 (3 carbons, heavy halogen)
*   c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2 (indole): 2.98803387 (aromatic, N-heterocycle)
*   CCCC(O)CC (hexan-3-ol): 2.98890903 (6 carbons, alcohol)
*   Clc1ccccc1Cl (1,2-dichlorobenzene): 2.96124369 (aromatic, halogens)

Our molecule, CCCOC=O, has 6 carbons and 2 oxygens. It's an ester.
It's less complex than the aromatic compounds, but more complex than simple alkanes.
The values around 3.0-3.5 seem plausible for molecules of this size and polarity.

Considering the structure and comparing it to the examples, it's a relatively simple ester. It's not as large or complex as the molecules with values above 4 or 5, nor as small as those below 1.

I'll estimate it to be slightly higher than simple alcohols of similar carbon count due to the ester group's specific contribution to the property, but lower than aromatic compounds.

My prediction is based on interpolating between the values of molecules with similar heavy atom counts and functional group complexity.

Predicted property value: 3.25
