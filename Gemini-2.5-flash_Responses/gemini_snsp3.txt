SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
The provided examples show a range of property values, and the task is to predict the property for `Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2`.

Let's analyze the given examples and the target molecule:

*   **Aromatic rings with halogens:** Molecules like `Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1`, `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`, `Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1`, `Brc1ccc(Br)cc1`, `Clc1cccc(Cl)c1`, `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl`, and `Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` consistently have a property value of **-0.09270983**. This suggests that the presence of halogenated aromatic rings often leads to this specific value.

*   **Alkanes and simple alcohols/ethers/amines:** Molecules like `CCCCCCCCBr`, `CCCC(O)CC`, `CCCCCCC(C)O`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`, `BrC(Br)(Br)Br`, `ClCCCl`, `CC(C)OC(C)C`, `CCC(O)CC`, `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC`, `CCC(C)(C)O`, `CNN`, `CC(C)C(C)C(C)C` have a property value of **0.0**. This indicates that simple aliphatic structures, even with some functional groups, tend to have a value of 0.0.

*   **Complex polycyclic or highly substituted aromatic systems:** Molecules like `CC34CCc1c(ccc2cc(O)ccc12)C3CCC4=O` (2.77180428), `C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13` (2.8860815), `CCCCCc1ccccc1` (3.90608631), `FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1` (3.40264009), `CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1` (3.90608631), `Cc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2` (3.54432998), `c1cc(C)cc2c1c3cc4cccc5CCc(c45)c3cc2` (3.40264009) show higher positive values. These are generally larger, more rigid, or highly substituted aromatic systems.

*   **Molecules with specific functional groups (e.g., amides, ureas, thioureas, carbonyls) often in conjunction with aromatic rings:**
    *   `CN(C)c1ccccc1` (-1.38003182)
    *   `Cc1cccc(C)c1O` (-1.38003182)
    *   `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1` (-1.38003182)
    *   `CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O` (-0.03107967) - a barbiturate derivative.
    *   `C1SC(=S)NC1(=O)` (-0.06198445) - a cyclic thiourea/amide.
    *   `C=CCS(=O)SCC=C` (-0.06198445) - a sulfoxide/thioether.
    *   `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` (-0.09270983) - a thiourea.
    *   `c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1` (-0.09270983) - a hydrazide.
    *   `Oc1ccccn1` (-0.09270983) - a pyridinol.
    *   `c1cncnc1` (-0.09270983) - a pyrimidine.
    *   `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (-0.09270983) - a nicotinamide.
    *   `O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2` (-0.09270983) - diphenyl ether.
    *   `CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(=O)C2` (-0.91748554) - a camphor-like ketone.
    *   `CC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O)C(=O)COC(C)=O` (2.14196626) - a complex steroid.
    *   `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` (3.78308651) - a complex organophosphate.
    *   `Cc1cc(no1)C(=O)NNCc2ccccc2` (2.41951122) - a complex amide/hydrazone.
    *   `CCCCCC=O` (2.35770279) - a simple aldehyde.

The target molecule is `Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2`.
This molecule contains:
1.  A difluorinated benzene ring.
2.  A urea linkage (`-C(=O)NC(=O)N-`).
3.  A monochlorinated benzene ring.

The presence of halogenated aromatic rings is a strong indicator for the value **-0.09270983** based on multiple examples. The urea linkage is also a significant functional group. Let's look for similar structures.

The molecule `CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O` has a urea-like structure within a ring and a value of **-0.03107967**.
The molecule `NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1` has a thiourea and an aromatic ring, with a value of **-0.09270983**.

The target molecule has *two* halogenated aromatic rings and a urea bridge. The dominant feature appears to be the halogenated aromatic rings, which consistently lead to the -0.09270983 value in the examples. While the urea group is present, the examples with halogenated aromatics (even with other functional groups like thiourea or simple fused rings) tend to converge to -0.09270983.

Given the strong pattern for halogenated aromatic compounds, especially those with multiple halogens or multiple halogenated rings, the value of -0.09270983 is highly probable.

The final answer is $\boxed{-0.09270983}$

True Property: 1.4819685629834747
Predicted Property:
The molecule provided is a complex steroid derivative with multiple functional groups, including ketones, esters, and hydroxyl groups. The presence of several oxygen atoms and a rigid polycyclic structure suggests a molecule with significant polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Let's analyze the provided examples to identify patterns:

*   **Simple hydrocarbons and halocarbons:** Often have values around 0.0 (e.g., CI, BrCCBr, CCC(C)(C)CC, CCCCCCCCCl, C1CCOC1, ClCC(C)C). This suggests a baseline for non-polar or minimally polar compounds.
*   **Aromatic compounds (especially with heteroatoms or multiple rings):** Tend to have negative values if they are simple (e.g., c1ccncc1, c1ccc2cnccc2c1, Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, Clc1cccc2ccccc12, NC(=O)c1cccnc1, Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2, NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, c3ccc2c(O)c1ccccc1cc2c3). However, if they have alkyl substituents or more complex structures, the values can be positive (e.g., Cc1ccc2cc(C)ccc2c1, Cc1cc(C)c2ccccc2c1, CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, Cc1ccccc1N, C2c1ccccc1N(CCF)C(=O)c3ccccc23).
*   **Compounds with carbonyls (ketones, esters, amides):** These often show positive values, indicating increased polarity or specific interactions.
    *   Ketones: CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O (3.86775957)
    *   Esters: CCOC(=O)C (3.74420298), CCCCC(=O)CCCC (-0.47177274 - this one is an outlier, possibly due to the long alkyl chains dominating)
    *   Amides: CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (1.34751651), CCN(CC)C(=O)CSc1ccc(Cl)nn1 (2.38869558)
*   **Steroid-like structures:**
    *   CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C (1.50167478) - This is a steroid with a ketone and a hydroxyl group.
    *   CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C (3.03675432) - This is a steroid with an ester and a ketone.

The target molecule, CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C, is a highly functionalized steroid. It contains:
1.  An acetate ester group: `CC(=O)OCC(=O)-`
2.  A ketone group: `=O` in the A-ring.
3.  Two hydroxyl groups: `C3(O)` and `C(O)`.
4.  A complex polycyclic steroid core.

Comparing it to the steroid examples:
*   `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` (1.50167478) has one ketone and one hydroxyl.
*   `CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C` (3.03675432) has one ester and one ketone.

Our target molecule has *two* carbonyls (one ester, one ketone) and *two* hydroxyl groups. This is a higher degree of oxygenation and polarity than the two steroid examples provided. The presence of multiple polar groups (ester, ketone, two hydroxyls) suggests a significantly positive value, likely higher than the 3.03675432 example due to the additional hydroxyl and the second carbonyl within the ester.

The acetate group `CC(=O)O` is a common motif. The `C(=O)C3(O)` part is also interesting, indicating a ketone adjacent to a tertiary alcohol. The overall structure is highly oxygenated.

Given the values for the steroid examples, especially the one with an ester and a ketone (3.03675432), and considering the additional hydroxyl group and the second carbonyl in the ester of the target molecule, the property value should be higher. The presence of multiple polar groups generally increases this property.

Let's consider the impact of each functional group:
*   Ketone: Positive contribution.
*   Ester: Positive contribution.
*   Hydroxyl: Positive contribution, especially multiple.

The molecule is more polar and complex than the 3.03675432 example. A value significantly higher than 3.03675432 is expected.

Considering the range of values, from negative for some aromatics to positive for highly functionalized compounds, and specifically looking at the steroid examples, the value should be in the higher positive range.

Let's estimate the increment from the additional functional groups. The difference between the two steroid examples is roughly 1.5 (3.03 - 1.50). This difference is associated with replacing a hydroxyl with an ester. Our molecule has an ester *and* an additional hydroxyl compared to the 1.50 example, and an additional hydroxyl compared to the 3.03 example.

A value around 4.0 or higher seems plausible given the high degree of oxygenation and the presence of multiple polar functional groups.

Final prediction based on the complexity and number of polar functional groups, especially compared to the steroid examples.

4.25

The final answer is $\boxed{4.25}$

SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
The molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 is a urea derivative with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms.

Let's analyze the provided examples to find similar structural motifs and their associated property values.

*   **Aromatic rings:** Many examples contain aromatic rings (e.g., `Oc1ccccc1Cl`, `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1`, `c1ccncc1`).
*   **Amide/Urea linkages:** `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (amide), `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (urea derivative), `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C` (urea derivative), `CCCC(C)(COC(N)=O)COC(N)=O` (carbamate/urea-like).

Let's look at the values for molecules with similar characteristics:

*   `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1`: 3.85648129 (Amide with a brominated phenyl)
*   `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1`: 3.74420298 (Cyclic urea derivative)
*   `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C`: -0.03107967 (Cyclic urea derivative, but with more alkyl substitution and a different ring system)
*   `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1`: -1.32980167 (Carbamate with a substituted phenyl)

The target molecule, O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, is N,N'-diphenylurea. It has a central urea group and two unsubstituted phenyl rings.

Comparing it to `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (an amide with a phenyl ring), the value is 3.85648129.
Comparing it to `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (a cyclic urea with alkyl groups), the value is 3.74420298.

The presence of two aromatic rings directly attached to the urea nitrogens suggests a relatively high value, similar to the amides and ureas with aromatic or complex alkyl structures. The values around 3.7-3.8 seem plausible for such structures.

Given the examples, the property seems to be related to molecular complexity, aromaticity, and specific functional groups. The urea linkage with two phenyl groups is a significant structural feature.

Let's consider the values again:
*   `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (Amide, one phenyl, one Br): 3.85648129
*   `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (Cyclic urea, alkyls): 3.74420298

The target molecule has two phenyl groups, which are larger and more complex than simple alkyl chains or a single brominated phenyl. This might lead to a slightly higher or comparable value.

Considering the range of values for similar complex molecules, especially those with aromatic rings and amide/urea functionalities, a value in the range of 3.7 to 3.9 seems appropriate.

Let's lean towards a value slightly higher than the cyclic urea with alkyls, and comparable to the amide with a brominated phenyl, due to the presence of two full phenyl rings.

Predicted property value: 3.80

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 3.8564812933452846
Predicted Property:
The molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 contains a furan ring, a nitro group, and a cyclic urea derivative. The presence of the nitro group and the furan ring, along with the conjugated system, suggests a significant electronic interaction. Comparing this to the examples, molecules with extended conjugation, aromatic systems, and polar groups tend to have non-zero and often positive values.

Specifically, the presence of a nitro group on an aromatic ring (or a heteroaromatic ring like furan) and a conjugated imine linkage is reminiscent of structures that exhibit higher property values. For instance, `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` has a value of -0.09270983, which is close to zero, but it also has two chlorine atoms which might reduce the value.

Consider `OCC1OC(C(O)C1O)n2cnc3c(O)ncnc23` with a value of 2.38869558, which has multiple polar groups and a fused ring system. Also, `CCOC=C` has 2.38869558, indicating that extended conjugation can lead to higher values.

The molecule `O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2` has a highly conjugated system involving the furan ring, the imine, and the nitro group. The cyclic urea part also contributes to the overall polarity and electronic distribution. The presence of the nitro group, a strong electron-withdrawing group, and the furan ring, which is an electron-rich heteroaromatic system, suggests a significant electronic interaction.

Given the examples, molecules with extended conjugation, polar groups, and heteroatoms tend to have positive values. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, and its presence on a conjugated system often leads to a higher property value. The furan ring also contributes to the electronic properties.

Considering the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, especially the nitro group and the conjugated imine, a positive value is expected. The value should be in a similar range to other complex, conjugated molecules with polar groups.

Based on the provided examples, a value around 2.38869558 (like `OCC1OC(C(O)C1O)n2cnc3c(O)ncnc23` or `CCOC=C`) seems plausible due to the extended conjugation and polar groups. However, the presence of the nitro group and the cyclic urea might push it slightly higher or lower depending on the specific interactions.

Let's re-evaluate. The molecule has a furan ring, a nitro group, and a cyclic urea. The imine bond connects the furan to the nitrogen of the urea. This creates a significant conjugated system.
Comparing to `Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2` (-0.09270983), which has a nitro group and an ether linkage, but also two chlorines.
Comparing to `OCC1OC(C(O)C1O)n2cnc3c(O)ncnc23` (2.38869558), which has multiple hydroxyls and a purine-like system.
Comparing to `CCOC=C` (2.38869558), which has a simple conjugated system.

The molecule in question has a more complex and extended conjugated system than `CCOC=C`, and the presence of the nitro group is a strong contributor to electronic properties. The cyclic urea also adds to the polarity.

Considering the examples, a value in the range of 2 to 3 seems reasonable for such a complex and conjugated system with polar groups. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which often leads to higher values in these types of properties.

Final prediction based on the complexity, conjugation, and presence of polar groups like nitro and the cyclic urea, which contribute to the overall electronic properties.

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 2.822496293632006
Predicted Property:
The molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 contains several functional groups and structural features that influence its properties.

1.  **Hydroxyl groups (OCC(O)C):** These are polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding, generally increasing polarity and potentially solubility in polar solvents.
2.  **Ester group (COC(=O)c1ccccc1):** This is a polar functional group.
3.  **Aromatic rings (c1ccccc1, c2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23):** These contribute to rigidity and hydrophobicity. The presence of two fused aromatic systems (quinoline derivative) suggests a larger, more rigid structure.
4.  **Amine linkage (-Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23):** The secondary amine is basic and can also participate in hydrogen bonding.
5.  **Chlorine atom (Cl):** This is an electronegative atom that adds polarity and can influence electronic properties.

Looking at the examples provided:

*   Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (e.g., C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO) tend to have a property value of 0.0. However, these are simple sugars or polyols without large aromatic or complex systems.
*   Molecules with complex fused aromatic systems, especially with heteroatoms or halogens, often have negative values (e.g., c1ccc2cnccc2c1, -0.09270983; Clc1ccc(I)cc1, -0.09270983; c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3, -0.09270983).
*   Molecules with a mix of polar groups (like amides, esters, alcohols) and aromatic rings can have a wide range of values. For instance, CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2 (1.51809284) and CC(OC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1)C#C (1.64973636) have positive values.
*   Molecules with a single aromatic ring and a simple polar group (e.g., Cc1cccc(O)c1, 3.40264009; CC(=O)c1ccccc1, 3.85648129) tend to have higher positive values.

The target molecule is quite large and complex, featuring a diol, an ester, a phenyl group, and a chlorinated quinoline system linked by an amine. The presence of the large, rigid, and chlorinated quinoline system, combined with the phenyl and the diol-ester chain, suggests a balance of polar and non-polar characteristics.

The examples with negative values are typically highly conjugated, often polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or simple halogenated aromatics. The examples with 0.0 are either very simple alkanes/ethers/alcohols or highly hydroxylated compounds. The examples with higher positive values often involve a single aromatic ring with a strong electron-withdrawing or donating group, or a simple amide/ester.

The target molecule has a significant aromatic character (two rings, one fused and chlorinated) and also polar groups (diol, ester, amine). The complexity and size, particularly the fused quinoline system with a chlorine, might push the value towards a lower or even negative range, similar to other complex aromatic systems. However, the diol and ester parts add polarity.

Considering the complexity and the presence of a large, chlorinated, fused heterocyclic system, it's likely to be in a similar range to other complex aromatic systems. The diol and ester might slightly increase it compared to purely aromatic systems, but the overall size and rigidity, especially the quinoline, are significant.

Given the examples, molecules with large, complex, or fused aromatic systems, especially with halogens, often have values around -0.09270983. The diol and ester add some polarity, but the overall structure is dominated by the large aromatic core.

True Property: 2.388695575492197
Predicted Property:
The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is a cyclic imide with a spirocyclopropane ring.

Looking at the provided examples, molecules with cyclic structures, especially those containing carbonyl groups and nitrogen atoms within rings, tend to have positive property values. For instance, `CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3ccccc23` has a value of `1.34751651`, `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` has `3.20079652`, and `O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23` has `3.67997357`.

The presence of multiple carbonyl groups and nitrogen atoms in a relatively rigid cyclic system suggests a significant dipole moment and potential for intermolecular interactions, which often correlates with higher property values in this context. The spirocyclopropane ring adds to the rigidity and potentially influences the electronic distribution.

Considering the structural features and comparing them to the examples, the molecule is likely to have a positive property value, similar to other cyclic imides or amides.

True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
The molecule provided is a complex carbohydrate structure, likely a derivative of a disaccharide or oligosaccharide, given the multiple cyclic ether rings and hydroxyl groups.

Let's analyze the provided examples to identify patterns:

*   **Simple Alkanes/Alkenes/Alkynes:** CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC (0.0), CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC (0.0), CCCCCCCCC=C (3.99641204), CCC#N (-0.03107967), CCC#CCC (-0.03107967), CCCC#C (-1.64332116), CBr (0.0), CC(C)CC(C)(C)O (0.0). These generally have values around 0 or slightly negative, with some exceptions for longer chains or specific functional groups.
*   **Halogenated Aromatics:** Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl (-0.09270983), Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl (-0.09270983), Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 (-0.09270983), Fc1cccc(F)c1 (-0.09270983), Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (-0.09270983). These consistently show values around -0.09.
*   **Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs):** c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24 (-0.09270983), Ic1cccc2ccccc12 (-0.09270983). These also show values around -0.09.
*   **Simple Alcohols/Ethers/Ketones/Aldehydes:** C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O (0.0), Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1 (-0.09270983), CCOc1ccccc1 (-1.38003182), COc1ccccc1O (3.40264009). Values vary.
*   **Complex Molecules with Heteroatoms (N, S, P, O, F, Cl, Br, I):** These show a wide range of values, from negative to positive. Many of the larger, more complex molecules with multiple rings and various functional groups tend to have higher positive values (e.g., 3.85648129, 3.714644, 2.43485121, 3.03675432, 3.93839584, 3.64730687, 4.00174157, 3.67997357, 4.00174157, 3.40264009, 1.17107069).

The target molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, is a highly oxygenated, polycyclic molecule with multiple hydroxyl groups. It resembles sugars or sugar derivatives.

Let's look at the example:
*   C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O (a cyclic sugar, likely a pyranose or furanose derivative) has a value of **0.0**.

The target molecule is essentially three linked sugar units (pyranose rings) with additional hydroxyl and hydroxymethyl groups. It's a very polar molecule due to the high density of oxygen atoms and hydroxyl groups.

Comparing it to C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O (which is a single sugar ring), the target molecule is much larger and more complex, being an oligosaccharide. While the single sugar has a value of 0.0, the complexity and size of the target molecule suggest it might deviate from this simple value.

However, the presence of many hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, characteristic of carbohydrates, might lead to a property value that is not extremely high or low, especially if the property relates to something like lipophilicity or a similar physical property where high polarity might lead to a specific range.

Given the examples, molecules with many simple C-H, C-C, C-O bonds, and high symmetry or simple structures often cluster around 0.0 or slightly negative. The single sugar example is 0.0. The target molecule is a larger, more complex sugar.

If the property is related to something like logP (octanol-water partition coefficient), highly polar molecules like sugars tend to have negative logP values, indicating high water solubility. However, the examples show a wide range.

Let's re-examine the 0.0 values:
*   CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC (long alkane)
*   CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC (long alkane)
*   CBr (simple alkyl halide)
*   CC(C)CC(C)(C)O (branched alcohol)
*   C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O (cyclic sugar)

The fact that a simple cyclic sugar (C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O) has a value of 0.0 is a strong indicator. The target molecule is essentially a larger version of this, still composed primarily of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in a sugar-like arrangement. While it's more complex, the fundamental building blocks and functional groups are the same. The property might be insensitive to the exact size for this class of molecules beyond a certain point, or it might be a property that scales in a way that keeps it near 0 for highly polar, water-soluble compounds.

Considering the examples, the value of 0.0 appears for very simple, non-polar molecules (long alkanes) as well as a simple sugar. This suggests that 0.0 might represent a baseline or a specific characteristic for certain types of molecules, perhaps related to a balance of forces or a specific type of interaction.

Given the structural similarity to C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, and the lack of other functional groups that significantly alter the electronic or steric properties (like halogens, nitrogen, sulfur, or aromatic systems that often lead to more extreme values), it is reasonable to predict a value close to that of the simpler sugar.

Final prediction based on the closest structural analogue (the single sugar unit) and the general trend for highly oxygenated, non-aromatic, non-halogenated compounds.

The predicted specific property value is: 0.0
