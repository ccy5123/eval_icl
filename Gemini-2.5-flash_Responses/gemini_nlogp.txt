SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.3862345645410203
Predicted Property:
1.  **Analyze the provided examples:**
    *   The property values range from highly negative (e.g., -2.7276576 for O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1) to highly positive (e.g., 2.80114138 for CCCCC(CC)COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC(CC)CCCC).
    *   **Negative values** are often associated with:
        *   Small, highly polar molecules (e.g., CO, ClC=C, ClCC).
        *   Molecules with multiple strong hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, especially in cyclic systems (e.g., barbiturate derivatives like O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, or uracil derivatives like O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1).
        *   Molecules with high unsaturation and small size (e.g., c1cncnc1).
    *   **Positive values** are often associated with:
        *   Larger, more hydrophobic molecules.
        *   Molecules with multiple halogen atoms, especially chlorine, and often in aromatic systems (e.g., ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl).
        *   Molecules with extended aromatic systems (e.g., Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32).
        *   Molecules with bulky alkyl groups.
        *   Molecules with phosphorus and sulfur, often in larger structures (e.g., CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12).

2.  **Examine the target molecule: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2**
    *   **Structure:** This molecule is a fused bicyclic system. It has a benzene ring fused to a 5-membered ring containing oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and a carbonyl group. It also has a chlorine atom attached to the benzene ring.
    *   **Key features:**
        *   **Aromaticity:** Contains a benzene ring.
        *   **Heteroatoms:** Oxygen, Nitrogen, Chlorine.
        *   **Polar groups:** Carbonyl (C=O), N-H (potential hydrogen bond donor).
        *   **Halogen:** One chlorine atom.
        *   **Size:** Moderately sized, not extremely large, but larger than simple halomethanes or small alcohols.

3.  **Compare with similar examples:**
    *   **Halogenated aromatics:**
        *   Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (1.5874959) - 5 Cl, OH. Much higher due to many Cl.
        *   Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (1.14043538) - 4 Cl, OH. Still high.
        *   Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 (0.24631434) - 2 Cl, OH. This is a good reference.
        *   Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (2.48243799) - 4 Cl, two phenyls. Very high.
        *   ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl (2.45630131) - 4 Cl, two phenyls. Very high.
    *   **Fused systems/heterocycles with carbonyls:**
        *   O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1 (-2.7276576) - Uracil-like, very polar, small.
        *   C1SC(=S)NC1(=O) (-1.50847005) - Small, polar, cyclic.
        *   Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C (-0.74276088) - Uracil derivative with Cl and bulky group. This is a very relevant comparison. It has a chlorine, two carbonyls, an N-H, and a bulky alkyl group. Its value is negative.
        *   CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 (1.29800814) - This is a larger molecule with a fused ring system (benzofuranone-like) and a chlorine, plus a phosphorodithioate group. Its value is positive.
        *   COc2c1occc1c(OC)c3c(=O)cc(C)oc23 (0.35976946) - Larger fused system, no halogens. Positive.

4.  **Synthesize the prediction:**
    *   The target molecule has one chlorine atom, which generally contributes positively to the property.
    *   It has a fused aromatic system, which also tends to contribute positively.
    *   It has an N-H and a C=O, which are polar and can contribute to a more negative value (similar to the uracil derivatives).
    *   The molecule `Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C` has a chlorine, two carbonyls, an N-H, and a bulky alkyl group, and its value is -0.74276088.
    *   The target molecule `Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2` has one chlorine, one carbonyl, one N-H, and a fused ring system. It lacks the bulky alkyl group of the `Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C` example, but it has a more extended aromatic system.
    *   The presence of the single chlorine atom and the fused aromatic system suggests a value that might be slightly positive or close to zero, rather than strongly negative like the small, highly polar, or multi-carbonyl systems.
    *   Consider `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (0.24631434) which has two chlorines and an OH. Our molecule has one chlorine, an N-H, and a C=O, and a fused ring. The fused ring and single chlorine might balance out the polarity of the N-H and C=O.
    *   The molecule is a 4-chlorobenzofuran-2(3H)-one derivative with an N-H instead of a CH2.
    *   The `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12` example (1.29800814) has a similar benzofuranone core with a chlorine, but it's a much larger molecule with a complex phosphorus group. This suggests the core itself with a chlorine can lead to positive values.
    *   Given the balance of a single chlorine (positive contribution) and the polar N-H/C=O groups (negative contribution), combined with the fused aromatic system, the value should be in the lower positive range or slightly negative.
    *   The `Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C` example is the closest in terms of functional groups (Cl, N-H, C=O) and ring system, and its value is -0.74276088. However, it has *two* carbonyls and a bulky alkyl group. Our target has only *one* carbonyl and a more condensed aromatic system. The single carbonyl and the more extended aromaticity might push it slightly higher than -0.74.
    *   Let's consider the impact of the fused ring vs. a simple phenyl. Fused rings often increase the value.
    *   The presence of a single chlorine atom on an aromatic ring often leads to values around 0 or slightly positive, especially if the rest of the molecule isn't overwhelmingly polar.
    *   Comparing to `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` (0.24631434), which has two chlorines, our molecule has one. This would suggest a lower value than 0.24.
    *   However, the fused ring system is more complex than a simple phenyl.
    *   The N-H and C=O are strong polar groups, pulling the value down.
    *   It's a delicate balance. The `Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C` example is very instructive. It has a similar core with Cl, N-H, C=O, and its value is negative. The target molecule is slightly less complex (one C=O vs two, no bulky tert-butyl). This might make it slightly less negative or even slightly positive.

    Let's re-evaluate the `Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C` example. It's a pyrimidine derivative. The target molecule is a benzoxazinone derivative. Both have a halogen, N-H, and C=O. The bulky tert-butyl group in the example might increase the value, making the base value of the core more negative.
    The target molecule is more compact and has a single chlorine. The presence of the N-H and C=O will make it quite polar.

    Given the examples, molecules with a single chlorine on an aromatic ring, combined with polar groups, tend to be around 0 or slightly negative.
    *   `Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C` (-0.74276088) is a strong guide. The target molecule is similar in polarity but lacks the bulky tert-butyl group and has one less carbonyl. The absence of the bulky group might make it slightly more negative, but the single carbonyl might make it less negative than the di-carbonyl.

    Let's consider the overall hydrophobicity/polarity balance. The chlorine adds some hydrophobicity, but the N-H and C=O add significant polarity. The fused ring system is moderately sized.

    I'll lean towards a value that is negative, but perhaps not as strongly negative as the very small, highly polar molecules, and not as positive as the multi-chlorinated or very large hydrophobic molecules. It should be in the range of the `Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C` example.

    The `CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12` (1.29800814) is a larger molecule with a similar benzofuranone core and a chlorine. The large phosphorus group likely contributes significantly to its positive value. Our molecule is much smaller.

    The value for `Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C` is -0.74. Our molecule has one less carbonyl, which might make it slightly less polar, pushing the value up. But it also lacks the bulky tert-butyl group, which might push it down.

    Considering the balance, a value slightly less negative than -0.74 seems plausible, or even slightly positive if the aromaticity dominates over the polarity. However, the strong N-H and C=O suggest a negative value.

    Let's consider the impact of the fused ring. `Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32` (1.3427005) is a large fused aromatic. Our molecule is much smaller.

    I'll estimate it to be in the negative range, but not extremely negative.

    Final consideration: The presence of the N-H and C=O in a cyclic system often leads to negative values (e.g., barbiturates, uracils). The chlorine adds some positive contribution, but likely not enough to overcome the polarity of the amide/lactam system.

    I predict a value slightly less negative than -0.74, perhaps around -0.5.

Predicted Property:
The molecule is a urea derivative, specifically N,N'-diphenylurea.
Let's analyze the structural features and compare them to the provided examples.

Key features:
- Two phenyl rings directly attached to the nitrogen atoms of a urea group.
- The urea group itself (O=C(N)N).

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have higher positive values (e.g., `Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12` (0.76), `c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3` (0.71), `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` (0.55)).
- Molecules with polar groups like -OH, -NH2, -C=O, especially if they can form hydrogen bonds, often have negative values (e.g., `OCC(O)CO` (-2.74), `OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (-3.80), `Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1` (-0.77), `NC(=S)N` (-2.15)).
- Halogenated compounds can vary, but often have positive values if they are highly substituted (e.g., `Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (1.78), `c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1` (1.11)).
- Simple alkanes or alkenes are often around zero or slightly positive/negative (e.g., `C1CCCCC1` (0.001), `CCC#CCC` (-0.36)).

Our molecule, O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, has two bulky phenyl groups and a central urea moiety. The urea group is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding, which might pull the value down. However, the two large hydrophobic phenyl groups will likely increase the value.

Let's consider similar structures:
- `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` (-0.217): This has one aromatic ring and a carbamate group. Our molecule has two aromatic rings and a urea group. The urea group is more polar than a carbamate.
- `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (0.046): This has one aromatic ring and an amide group. Our molecule has two aromatic rings and a urea group.

The presence of two phenyl rings suggests a higher value than compounds with one phenyl ring and a polar group. The urea group is polar, but the overall hydrophobicity from the two phenyl rings might dominate.

Let's try to estimate based on the balance of aromaticity/hydrophobicity and polarity/hydrogen bonding.
- Aromatic systems tend to increase the value. Two phenyl rings are significant.
- The urea group is polar and can form strong hydrogen bonds, which usually decreases the value.

Consider `Oc1ccccc1Cl` (-0.2007) - one phenyl, one OH, one Cl.
Consider `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (0.046) - one phenyl, one amide, one Br.
Consider `c1ccncc1` (-0.860) - one pyridine ring.

The molecule has two phenyl rings, which are quite large and hydrophobic. This would push the value up. The urea group is polar and can form hydrogen bonds, which would pull the value down.

Let's compare to `CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1` (-0.217). This has one aromatic ring with two methyl groups and a carbamate. Our molecule has two unsubstituted phenyl rings and a urea. The two phenyl rings are a significant increase in size and hydrophobicity compared to one substituted phenyl. The urea group is similar in polarity to a carbamate, perhaps slightly more polar due to two N-H bonds.

Given the two phenyl rings, the value should be higher than compounds with only one phenyl ring and a polar group. However, the strong polarity of the urea group will prevent it from being as high as purely aromatic systems like `Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12` (0.76).

I'd expect it to be positive, but not extremely high. Perhaps in the range of 0 to 0.3.
Let's consider the balance. Two phenyls are quite substantial. The urea group is polar.
If we consider `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (0.046), which has one phenyl and an amide, adding another phenyl might increase it.

Let's try to find a balance. The two phenyl rings contribute significantly to the overall size and hydrophobicity. The urea group is polar.
It's likely to be a positive value, but not as high as highly halogenated or very large fused aromatic systems.

I'll estimate it to be slightly positive, reflecting the balance between the two large hydrophobic phenyl groups and the polar urea moiety.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.8716927545023044
Predicted Property:
1.  **Analyze the input molecule:** COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1. This is an organophosphate derivative, similar to several examples provided.

2.  **Identify key structural features and compare to examples:**
    *   **Core structure:** COP(=S)(OC)O-aryl. This motif is present in several high-value examples:
        *   COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl (1.58256962)
        *   COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl (1.47453341)
        *   COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (1.50792269)
    *   **Aryl substitution:** The aryl ring in the target molecule is substituted with -SC (thiomethyl) and -C (methyl).
    *   **Comparison of substituents:**
        *   The examples above have halogens (Cl, Br, I) on the aryl ring. Halogens are generally electron-withdrawing.
        *   The target molecule has -SC and -C. Methyl (-C) is electron-donating. Thiomethyl (-SC) can be slightly electron-donating or withdrawing depending on context, but often behaves similarly to an ether or thioether, which are generally less strongly electron-withdrawing than halogens.

3.  **Hypothesize the effect of substituents on the property:**
    *   The examples with halogens (Cl, Br, I) on the aryl ring consistently show high positive values (around 1.47 to 1.58). This suggests that electron-withdrawing groups on the aryl ring contribute to a higher positive value.
    *   The target molecule has a methyl group (electron-donating) and a thiomethyl group. These are likely less electron-withdrawing, or even electron-donating, compared to the halogens in the high-value examples.

4.  **Predict the direction of change:** Since the substituents on the aryl ring are less electron-withdrawing (or more electron-donating) than the halogens in the high-value examples, the property value for the target molecule should be *lower* than those halogenated examples.

5.  **Estimate the magnitude:** The difference in electronic character between halogens and alkyl/thioalkyl groups is significant. Therefore, the value should be noticeably lower than 1.4-1.6.

6.  **Consider other examples:**
    *   Many molecules with simple alkyl or aryl groups have values closer to 0 or negative.
    *   The "COP(=S)(OC)O-aryl" core seems to be a strong driver for positive values.

7.  **Refine the prediction:** The core structure is very similar to the high-value examples. The change in substituents from strong electron-withdrawing halogens to less electron-withdrawing/more electron-donating groups like methyl and thiomethyl will likely reduce the value, but it should still remain positive due to the overall organophosphate structure. A value in the range of 0.8 to 1.2 seems reasonable, significantly lower than the halogenated analogues but still positive.

8.  **Final specific prediction:** Given the strong similarity to the 1.4-1.6 range examples, but with less electron-withdrawing substituents, a value around 1.0-1.1 seems plausible. Let's pick a value that reflects this reduction.

1.08

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.2762825813315571
Predicted Property:
The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is *trans*-1,2-dichloroethene.

Based on the provided examples, the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, polarity, and the presence of certain functional groups.

Let's analyze the given examples for patterns:
*   **Halogenated Alkanes/Alkenes:**
    *   CCBr: -0.64164885 (Bromoethane)
    *   CCCCBr: -0.10783094 (1-Bromobutane)
    *   Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl: 3.37655904 (Highly chlorinated biphenyl)
    *   Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl: 0.24631434 (2,4-Dichlorophenol)
    *   Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1: -0.28517727 (4-Chloroaniline)
    *   COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl: 2.23222368 (Chlorinated organophosphate)

*   **Simple Alkenes/Alkanes:**
    *   CC1CCCC1: -0.09749943 (Cyclopentane derivative)
    *   CCCC(C)C: 0.07081537 (2-Methylpentane)
    *   CCCC(=C)C: 0.01614727 (2-Methyl-1-butene)
    *   CC1=CCCCC1: 0.11474143 (1-Methylcyclohexene)

*   **Alcohols/Ethers:**
    *   CCCCCCCCO: 0.00013684 (1-Octanol)
    *   CCCCO: -1.06749897 (1-Butanol)
    *   CCCCOCCO: -1.05614114 (2-(2-Butoxy)ethanol)

*   **Ketones/Aldehydes:**
    *   CCCC(=O)C: -0.65923295 (2-Pentanone)
    *   CCC=O: -1.19305086 (Propanal)
    *   CCCCCCC(=O)OCC: 0.12377295 (Ethyl octanoate)

The target molecule, Cl\C=C/Cl, is *trans*-1,2-dichloroethene. It is a small, halogenated alkene.

Comparing it to similar structures:
*   CCBr (-0.64164885) and CCCCBr (-0.10783094) are saturated bromoalkanes. The values are negative.
*   The highly chlorinated aromatic compounds have positive and often large values (e.g., 3.37655904, 2.23222368).
*   Simple alkenes like CCCC(=C)C (0.01614727) and CC1=CCCCC1 (0.11474143) have small positive values.

*trans*-1,2-dichloroethene is a small molecule with two chlorine atoms and a double bond. It has a dipole moment (though smaller than the *cis* isomer due to cancellation).

Given the values for simple alkanes/alkenes are around 0 to 0.1, and simple bromoalkanes are negative, a chlorinated alkene of similar size might be expected to be in a similar range, possibly slightly negative or a small positive value, depending on the specific property. The presence of two electronegative chlorine atoms on a small alkene backbone suggests a property value that might be influenced by their electron-withdrawing nature and the overall polarity.

Considering the trend that increasing halogenation (especially on aromatic rings) tends to increase the property value significantly (e.g., 3.37 for hexachlorobiphenyl), but simple alkyl halides are negative, a small chlorinated alkene like *trans*-1,2-dichloroethene would likely fall somewhere in between.

Let's consider the size and functional groups. It's a small molecule, similar in size to bromoethane or propanal.
*   CCBr: -0.64
*   CCC=O: -1.19
*   CCCC(=O)C: -0.66

These are all negative. However, the presence of a double bond and two chlorines might shift it.
The *trans* isomer has a smaller net dipole moment than the *cis* isomer, but it's still a polar molecule.

Given the examples, the property seems to be related to hydrophobicity/lipophilicity or perhaps a measure of molecular interaction/polarizability. Halogenation generally increases lipophilicity.

If we consider the simplest halogenated alkane, CCBr, it's -0.64. Adding another carbon (CCCCBr) makes it -0.10. This suggests that for simple alkyl halides, increasing chain length makes the value less negative (closer to zero or positive).

Cl\C=C/Cl is an alkene, not an alkane. The double bond introduces rigidity and different electronic properties.
Comparing to simple alkenes:
*   CCCC(=C)C: 0.016
*   CC1=CCCCC1: 0.114

These are small positive values. The presence of two chlorines will significantly alter the electronic distribution compared to a hydrocarbon alkene.

Given the examples, a value around -0.2 to 0.2 seems plausible for a small, somewhat polar, halogenated alkene. The *trans* configuration leads to some dipole cancellation, making it less polar than the *cis* isomer.

Let's consider the impact of halogens on small molecules.
*   CCBr: -0.64
*   Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1: -0.28 (chloroaniline)
*   Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl: 0.24 (dichlorophenol)

The values vary. The property is not simply about the number of halogens.

However, if we consider the general trend for small, relatively simple molecules, the values tend to be negative or small positive. The highly positive values are for very complex, often poly-halogenated aromatic systems.

For a molecule of this size and type, a value in the range of -0.5 to 0.5 seems reasonable.
Given the examples, a value slightly negative or slightly positive, but close to zero, would fit.

Let's try to interpolate or extrapolate from the given data.
The molecule is small, contains halogens, and has a double bond.
It's more polar than a simple alkene like CCCC(=C)C (0.016) but less polar than a highly substituted aromatic compound.

Considering the values for simple molecules:
*   Alkanes/Alkenes: around 0 to 0.1
*   Simple alcohols/ethers: around -1.0
*   Simple ketones/aldehydes: around -0.6 to -1.2
*   Simple alkyl halides (bromo): -0.64 to -0.10

The presence of two chlorines on a double bond.
If we consider the effect of halogens, they tend to increase the property for larger, more complex molecules (e.g., 3.37 for hexachlorobiphenyl). For smaller molecules, the effect is less clear-cut from the examples.

Let's consider the structure: Cl-CH=CH-Cl. It's a small, rigid molecule.
The property seems to be related to some form of molecular interaction or partitioning.

Given the values for simple molecules, a value close to zero or slightly negative seems most appropriate.
The *trans* isomer has a zero net dipole moment due to symmetry, which might make it behave more like a non-polar molecule than the *cis* isomer. If the property is related to polarity, this would be a key factor.

If the property is related to logP or similar lipophilicity measures, then adding chlorines generally increases it.
*   Ethane (hypothetical, likely negative)
*   Ethene (hypothetical, likely negative or small positive)
*   Chloroethane (similar to bromoethane, so around -0.6)
*   1,2-dichloroethane (likely more positive than chloroethane, but still negative or small positive)

For *trans*-1,2-dichloroethene, the symmetry and small size suggest a value that is not extremely high or low.
Given the range of values for simple molecules, a value around -0.1 to 0.1 seems plausible.

Let's consider the closest structural analogues from the list:
*   CCBr: -0.64164885 (bromoethane)
*   CCCCBr: -0.10783094 (1-bromobutane)
*   CCCC(=C)C: 0.01614727 (2-methyl-1-butene)

The molecule in question is an alkene with two chlorines. It's smaller than 1-bromobutane but has two halogens.
The property for simple alkenes is slightly positive. The property for simple alkyl halides is negative.
The presence of two chlorines might push it towards a slightly positive value, or keep it slightly negative.

Given the examples, a value around -0.1 to 0.1 seems reasonable.
Let's consider the effect of the double bond and the two chlorines.
The *trans* configuration leads to a cancellation of bond dipoles, resulting in a zero net dipole moment. This might make it behave more like a non-polar molecule in some contexts.

If the property is related to boiling point or vapor pressure, then *trans*-1,2-dichloroethene has a boiling point of 47.5 °C, which is higher than ethene (-103.7 °C) but lower than 1,2-dichloroethane (83.5 °C).

Considering the values for simple hydrocarbons (around 0 to 0.1) and simple halogenated alkanes (negative), a value close to zero seems most likely for a small, symmetrical, halogenated alkene.

Final prediction based on the observed trends for small molecules and the specific structure of *trans*-1,2-dichloroethene (small, symmetrical, two halogens, double bond).

Predicted Property:
1.  **Analyze the molecule:** CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
    *   It's a bicyclic system, with a five-membered ring (C-C-S-C-C) fused to a benzene ring via an amide linkage.
    *   Contains a sulfone group (S(=O)(=O)), an amide group (C(=O)N), and a benzene ring.
    *   The sulfone group is highly polar and electron-withdrawing.
    *   The amide group is also polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
    *   The benzene ring adds hydrophobicity and aromaticity.
    *   The overall structure suggests a balance of polar and non-polar features.

2.  **Compare to examples:**
    *   **Molecules with sulfone/sulfoxide groups:** None directly in the examples, but these groups generally increase polarity and can influence solubility and electronic properties.
    *   **Molecules with amide groups:**
        *   `O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC`: -1.49, cyclic imide, highly polar, multiple H-bond donors/acceptors.

        *   `Sc2nc1ccccc1s2`: 0.168, sulfur and nitrogen in fused rings.
        *   `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(O)CCC12C)C3CCC4=O`: 1.11, complex steroid-like.

    *   **Molecules with benzene rings and polar groups:**
        *   `CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C`: 1.06, large, complex, with P=S, ester, amide.
        *   `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl`: 2.48, highly chlorinated biphenyl, very hydrophobic.
        *   `Oc1ccc(O)cc1`: -0.85, dihydroxybenzene.
        *   `Fc1ccc(F)cc1`: -0.26, difluorobenzene.
        *   `Brc1ccc(I)cc1`: 0.49, bromoiodobenzene.
        *   `CC(C)OC(=O)C(O)(c1ccc(Br)cc1)c2ccc(Br)cc2`: 1.41, large, ester, alcohol, two brominated benzenes.

3.  **Reasoning for prediction:**
    *   The molecule has a significant polar component (sulfone, amide, oxygen in the ring) and a hydrophobic component (benzene ring, aliphatic carbons).
    *   The sulfone group is a strong electron-withdrawing group and contributes significantly to polarity.
    *   The amide group also adds polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.
    *   The bicyclic nature and the presence of the benzene ring suggest a value that is not extremely negative (like simple alcohols or small polar molecules) nor extremely positive (like highly chlorinated or very large hydrophobic molecules).
    *   It's more complex and larger than simple benzenes like `Fc1ccc(F)cc1` (-0.26) or `Oc1ccc(O)cc1` (-0.85).
    *   It's less hydrophobic than `Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (2.48) or `CCCCCCCCCCCCCC` (2.30).
    *   It shares some complexity with molecules like `CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C` (1.06) or `CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(O)CCC12C)C3CCC4=O` (1.11), which have values around 1.0-1.1. These molecules are relatively large and have a mix of polar and non-polar features.
    *   The sulfone group is quite polar, which might pull the value down slightly compared to purely hydrocarbon-like complex molecules, but the overall size and aromaticity will keep it from being very negative.
    *   Considering the balance of polar (sulfone, amide, ether oxygen) and non-polar (benzene, aliphatic carbons) features, and its moderate size, a value in the range of 0.5 to 1.0 seems reasonable. The sulfone and amide are significant polar contributors, but the benzene ring and the overall size prevent it from being highly negative.

4.  **Refine the estimate:** The presence of the sulfone and amide, while polar, are part of a larger, somewhat rigid structure. It's not as "open" or "flexible" for extensive H-bonding as some of the highly negative examples (e.g., sugars). It's also not as purely hydrophobic as the highly positive examples. The value should be positive, reflecting its size and aromaticity, but not extremely high due to the polar groups. A value slightly below 1.0 seems appropriate, perhaps in the 0.7-0.9 range.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -2.1938396948526595
Predicted Property:
The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 contains a spirocyclic system with a cyclopropane ring fused to a pyrimidine-2,4,6-trione derivative. The presence of multiple carbonyl groups and nitrogen atoms suggests a polar molecule with potential for hydrogen bonding. The compact, rigid structure due to the spiro center and the cyclopropane ring will influence its properties.

Considering the provided examples:
- Small, simple hydrocarbons or molecules with few functional groups tend to have negative or small positive values (e.g., C1CCCCC1, -0.00109473; CCCCCCCO, -0.26677211).
- Molecules with multiple halogens, especially chlorine, or large aromatic systems tend to have higher positive values (e.g., Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, 3.37655904; c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54, 2.3250705).
- Molecules with multiple polar functional groups like alcohols, amides, or ketones can have a range of values, often negative or small positive, depending on the overall balance of polarity and size. For instance, C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O (a sugar derivative) has a very negative value (-3.36718541), likely due to extensive hydrogen bonding and compact structure.

The target molecule has a relatively small size but is highly functionalized with three carbonyl groups and two amide nitrogens. This suggests significant polarity and potential for intermolecular interactions. The spiro cyclopropane ring adds rigidity and some steric bulk.

Comparing it to molecules with similar functional groups:
- Amides and imides: Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12 (-1.64476399), CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (0.06465751). These show a range, but the target molecule has a more constrained, cyclic imide-like structure.
- Cyclic ketones/amides: O2c1ccc(N)cc1N(C)C(=O)c3cc(C)ccc23 (0.42456381), CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3ccccc23 (0.74961663). These are larger and contain aromatic rings, leading to higher values.

The target molecule is smaller than the cyclic amide examples with aromatic rings, but more polar and rigid than simple alkanes or single functional group molecules. The presence of three carbonyls and two nitrogens in a constrained ring system suggests a property value that is likely to be positive, but not as high as highly chlorinated or large polycyclic aromatic compounds. It might be in a similar range to some of the smaller, more polar cyclic compounds or those with a moderate number of polar groups.

Given the compact, highly oxygenated and nitrogenated structure, it's likely to be more polar than simple hydrocarbons but less extended than large aromatic systems. The spiro center adds a unique structural feature.

Considering the examples, a value in the range of -0.5 to 0.5 seems plausible for a molecule of this size and functionalization. The high density of polar groups in a small, rigid framework might lead to a slightly negative or small positive value.

Let's consider the impact of the cyclopropane ring. It's a small, strained ring, which can influence properties. The overall structure is somewhat reminiscent of barbituric acid derivatives, which are known to be polar.

Final prediction based on structural features and comparison to examples: The molecule is relatively small, highly polar due to multiple C=O and N-H groups, and has a rigid, compact structure. This combination often leads to properties that are not extremely high or low, but rather in a moderate range. The presence of multiple hydrogen bond donors and acceptors will significantly influence its interactions.

Predicted Property:
1.  **Analyze the input molecule:** ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl

    This molecule is highly chlorinated, featuring a complex polycyclic structure. It appears to be a derivative of a highly chlorinated hydrocarbon, possibly related to pesticides like DDT or similar compounds, but with a more fused and cage-like structure. The presence of many chlorine atoms suggests a high molecular weight and significant electron withdrawal.

2.  **Recall properties of highly chlorinated molecules from examples:**

    *   `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (Hexachlorocyclohexane, HCH): 0.89316315
    *   `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (Tetrachlorophenol): 1.14043538
    *   `ClCCCl` (1,2-Dichloroethane): -0.59868068
    *   `Clc1ccccc1` (Chlorobenzene): 0.00068421
    *   `Fc1ccc(F)cc1` (1,4-Difluorobenzene): -0.25603007 (Fluorine is similar to chlorine in electronegativity but smaller)
    *   `BrC(Br)Br` (Tribromomethane): 0.07916269 (Bromine is heavier than chlorine)

3.  **Identify key structural features and their likely impact:**

    *   **High degree of chlorination:** The molecule has 10 chlorine atoms. This is a very high number, even more than hexachlorocyclohexane (6 Cl) or tetrachlorophenol (4 Cl). High halogenation generally leads to increased density, lipophilicity, and often higher boiling points/melting points. In the context of the given property, highly chlorinated compounds tend to have positive values, and the more chlorines, the higher the value seems to be.
    *   **Polycyclic/Cage-like structure:** The fused rings (C1CC2C(C1Cl)C3...C2...C3) indicate a rigid, compact structure. This often contributes to higher melting points and lower volatility compared to open-chain or simple cyclic compounds.
    *   **Double bond within the chlorinated system:** `C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl`. This introduces some rigidity and potentially different electronic properties compared to fully saturated systems.

4.  **Compare with similar examples:**

    *   `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (HCH) has a value of 0.893. Our molecule has 10 chlorines compared to HCH's 6. It's also a more complex, fused system.
    *   `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl` (Tetrachlorophenol) has a value of 1.140. This is a substituted aromatic, not a purely aliphatic/alicyclic system like the target.
    *   The general trend for increasing halogenation (especially Cl, Br) seems to be an increase in the property value, moving from negative/near zero to positive.

5.  **Estimate the value:**

    Given that HCH (6 Cl) is ~0.89 and tetrachlorophenol (4 Cl) is ~1.14, a molecule with 10 chlorines in a complex, rigid structure is expected to have a significantly higher positive value. It's likely to be one of the highest values among the examples provided for highly halogenated compounds.

    The highest values in the examples are:
    *   `CC(=O)C3(C)CCC4C2C=C(C)C1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C`: 2.012
    *   `Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13`: 2.342

    These are large, complex hydrocarbons. Our molecule is also large and complex, but with heavy chlorine atoms instead of just carbons and hydrogens. The presence of so many heavy atoms and the rigid structure should push the value higher than HCH.

    A value significantly above 1.0, possibly approaching or exceeding 1.5, seems reasonable. It's a very dense, highly substituted molecule.

    Let's consider the increment per chlorine. It's not linear, but generally positive.
    From `ClCCCl` (-0.598) to `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl` (0.893), there's a large jump.
    The target molecule is even more chlorinated and structurally complex.

    I'll estimate a value that reflects the extreme level of chlorination and structural complexity, placing it among the higher positive values observed for large, rigid molecules.
