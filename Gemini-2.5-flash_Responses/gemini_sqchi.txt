SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.3967430043991601
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, the property seems to be related to the molecular structure, likely a physical or chemical descriptor. Let's analyze the given molecule:

CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC

This molecule is methyl decanoate, an ester with a long alkyl chain.

Looking at the examples, we have:
- `CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl dodecanoate) with a property of `0.56571472`.
- `CCCCCCC(=O)C` (octan-2-one) with a property of `-0.69171172`.
- `CCCCCCCC(C)O` (nonan-2-ol) with a property of `-0.75582799`.
- `CCCCCCC(C)O` (octan-2-ol) with a property of `-0.73687274`.
- `CCCCCC(C)C` (2-methylheptane) with a property of `-0.69327523`.
- `CCCCCC` (hexane) with a property of `-0.22220747`.
- `CCCC(C)O` (pentan-2-ol) with a property of `0.2151758`.
- `CCOC(=O)CC` (ethyl propanoate) with a property of `0.20031189`.

There appears to be a trend where increasing chain length in similar functional groups leads to a change in the property. For esters, we have `CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (12 carbons in the acid part) with a value of `0.56571472`. The target molecule `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` has 10 carbons in the acid part.

Comparing `CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (12 carbons) with `0.56571472`, and considering that the target molecule `CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` has a slightly shorter chain (10 carbons), we might expect a value that is somewhat similar but potentially slightly different.

The values for long-chain hydrocarbons and alcohols are negative, while the esters are positive. The value for methyl dodecanoate is `0.56571472`. A slightly shorter chain might lead to a slightly different value, but likely still positive and in the same range.

Given the limited examples and the nature of the property, a precise prediction is challenging without a clear mathematical relationship. However, based on the closest structural analogue, `CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`, which has a value of `0.56571472`, and the fact that the target molecule is a very similar ester with a slightly shorter chain, the value should be in the same vicinity.

Let's consider the general trend for increasing chain length in similar compounds. For example, comparing `CCCCCCC(C)O` (-0.73687274) and `CCCCCCCC(C)O` (-0.75582799), the value becomes slightly more negative with increasing chain length. However, for the esters, we only have one long-chain example.

If we assume a relatively linear relationship for similar structures, a slightly shorter chain might lead to a slightly lower positive value or a slightly higher positive value depending on the exact nature of the property. Without more ester examples, it's hard to pinpoint the exact direction of change.

However, the most direct comparison is with `CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`. The difference is only two carbons in the alkyl chain. Therefore, the property value should be very close to `0.56571472`.

Given the precision of the provided examples, I will provide a value that is very close to the most similar example.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.739395516926173
Predicted Property:
Based on the provided examples, I will predict the property for the molecule `CCCCCC(=O)OCC`.

The examples show a range of molecular structures and their associated property values. I need to identify patterns related to functional groups, chain length, and branching that influence the property.

Let's analyze some relevant examples:

*   `CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC`, -0.65417618 (Methyl nonanoate - an ester with a long alkyl chain)
*   `COC=O`, 2.65241112 (Methyl formate - a small ester)
*   `CCOC(=O)N`, 1.20730376 (Ethyl carbamate - an ester with a nitrogen)
*   `CC(C)OC(=O)C`, 0.38687499 (Isopropyl acetate - a branched ester)

The target molecule is `CCCCCC(=O)OCC`, which is ethyl hexanoate. This is an ester with a 6-carbon alkyl chain on the acyl side and a 2-carbon ethyl group on the alcohol side.

Comparing it to `CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (methyl nonanoate), which has a value of -0.65417618, our molecule has a shorter alkyl chain (6 carbons vs 9 carbons) and an ethyl group instead of a methyl group. Generally, for similar functional groups, increasing chain length tends to decrease the property value (make it more negative or less positive).

Let's consider the general trend for esters. Small esters like `COC=O` have high positive values. As the alkyl chain length increases, the value tends to decrease.

`CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` has 9 carbons in the acyl chain and 1 carbon in the alcohol part, total 10 carbons. Value: -0.65417618.
Our molecule `CCCCCC(=O)OCC` has 6 carbons in the acyl chain and 2 carbons in the alcohol part, total 8 carbons.

The property seems to be related to hydrophobicity/lipophilicity or some form of molecular size/surface area, with larger, more non-polar molecules tending towards more negative values.

Given that `CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC` (10 carbons total) is -0.65417618, and our molecule `CCCCCC(=O)OCC` (8 carbons total) is slightly smaller, I would expect its value to be less negative (or more positive) than -0.65417618, but still in the negative range or slightly positive, as it's a relatively long-chain ester.

Let's look at the difference in chain length. A decrease of 2 carbons in the acyl chain and an increase of 1 carbon in the alcohol chain (compared to methyl nonanoate) suggests a slight shift towards a less negative value.

Considering the general trend of decreasing values with increasing chain length for similar compounds, and the fact that ethyl hexanoate is shorter than methyl nonanoate, its value should be higher than -0.65417618.

I'll estimate a value that is slightly less negative than -0.65417618, but still within the range observed for similar-sized molecules.

Predicted property: -0.45

The final answer is $\boxed{-0.45}$

Predicted Property:
The molecule ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is a highly chlorinated polycyclic compound. Based on the provided examples, highly halogenated molecules, especially those with multiple chlorine atoms, tend to have positive property values, and often higher values when the halogenation is extensive and the molecule is rigid or compact.

Let's analyze the given examples:
*   `ClCC#N`: 1.71823267 (Two chlorines, compact)
*   `ClCCCl`: 0.62709419 (Three chlorines, small)
*   `ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl`: 0.05951572 (Hexachlorocyclohexane, 6 chlorines, cyclic, but perhaps the symmetry or saturation leads to a lower value compared to more rigid/unsaturated chlorinated compounds)
*   `Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl`: -0.75477788 (Tetrachlorophenol, 4 chlorines, but the presence of -OH and aromaticity might influence it differently)
*   `Fc1ccc(F)cc1`: 0.50633535 (Two fluorines, aromatic)
*   `Clc1ccccc1`: 0.18646355 (One chlorine, aromatic)
*   `CC(C)OC(=O)C(O)(c1ccc(Br)cc1)c2ccc(Br)cc2`: 4.28540619 (Two bromines, large molecule, complex structure)
*   `CS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(cc1)C(O)C(CO)NC(=O)C(Cl)Cl`: 4.85299077 (Two chlorines, large molecule, complex structure)

The target molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, is a highly chlorinated cage-like structure. It has 10 chlorine atoms. The presence of a double bond and the rigid, compact, and highly substituted nature of the molecule suggest a significantly positive value. It shares some structural complexity and high halogenation with molecules like `CC(C)OC(=O)C(O)(c1ccc(Br)cc1)c2ccc(Br)cc2` (4.28) and `CS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(cc1)C(O)C(CO)NC(=O)C(Cl)Cl` (4.85), which have high values despite fewer halogens. The sheer number of chlorines and the compact, rigid structure are key factors.

Considering the high degree of chlorination (10 Cl atoms) and the rigid, somewhat unsaturated polycyclic structure, the property value is expected to be high and positive. It should be significantly higher than simple chlorinated alkanes or aromatics.

Given the examples, a value in the range of 4-6 seems plausible for highly chlorinated, complex structures. The molecule is very dense with chlorine atoms.

Observing the trend, molecules with more complex structures, multiple rings, and especially those containing phosphorus, sulfur, and halogen atoms tend to have higher positive values. For instance, the molecule `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1` has a very high value of 12.25540834. This molecule contains two phosphorus atoms, two sulfur atoms, and a chlorine atom, along with a complex branched chain and an aromatic ring.

Conversely, simpler hydrocarbons or molecules with fewer heteroatoms and less complex branching tend to have negative or small positive values.

The target molecule, `COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1`, is quite complex. It features:
1.  **Two phosphorus atoms**, each part of a thiophosphate group `P(=S)(OC)OC`.
2.  **One sulfur atom** acting as a bridge between two phenyl rings.
3.  **Two phenyl rings**.
4.  **Multiple oxygen atoms** (part of the thiophosphate esters and linking to the phenyl rings).

This structure shares significant complexity with the high-value example `COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1`. The presence of two thiophosphate groups and a bridging sulfur atom, along with two aromatic rings, suggests a high molecular weight and potentially high lipophilicity or other properties that correlate with the observed high values in the examples. The lack of a chlorine atom might slightly reduce the value compared to the highest example, but the overall complexity and the presence of multiple P and S atoms are strong indicators for a high positive value.

Considering the structural features, particularly the two thiophosphate moieties and the bridging sulfur, the molecule is likely to have a property value in the higher range of the provided examples. It is more complex and contains more "heavy" atoms (P, S) than many of the negative or low-positive examples.

Given the highest value observed is 12.25540834 for a molecule with one P, two S, and one Cl, the target molecule with two P and one S (and no Cl) is likely to be in a similar high range, perhaps slightly lower than the absolute maximum but still very high.

Predicted property value: 10.5

True Property: 11.065757002199978
Predicted Property:
The molecule provided is a complex carbohydrate structure, likely a polysaccharide or a highly branched oligosaccharide. The examples provided show a range of molecules from simple hydrocarbons to complex steroids and organophosphates, with their corresponding property values.

Looking at the examples, larger, more complex, and often more rigid or highly functionalized molecules tend to have higher positive property values. For instance, the steroid derivatives (e.g., `CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO`) have high positive values. Conversely, smaller, simpler, or highly symmetrical molecules, or those with significant internal hydrogen bonding, often have negative or small positive values.

The given molecule `OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O` is a large, highly oxygenated, and branched structure, characteristic of a sugar polymer. It contains multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, suggesting a high degree of hydrogen bonding potential and a relatively rigid, bulky structure.

Comparing it to the examples:
- `C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O` (a simple sugar, likely a cyclic monosaccharide) has a value of -0.26268779.
- The provided molecule is significantly larger and more complex than this simple sugar, featuring multiple linked sugar units.

Given its size, complexity, and the presence of many hydroxyl groups, it is expected to have a higher property value than simple sugars, but likely not as high as some of the extremely large and rigid organophosphates or steroids. The extensive hydrogen bonding network might also influence the value.

Considering the trend that larger, more complex, and highly functionalized molecules tend to have higher positive values, and given the multi-unit sugar structure, the property value should be significantly positive.

Predicted Property:
The provided examples show a wide range of molecular structures and their corresponding property values. Analyzing the examples, it appears that the property values are influenced by factors such as:

*   **Molecular size and complexity:** Larger, more complex molecules tend to have higher property values (e.g., `CC1OC(CC(O)C1O)OC2C(O)CC(OC2C)OC8C(O)CC(OC7CCC3(C)C(CCC4C3CCC5(C)C(CCC45O)C6=CC(=O)OC6)C7)OC8C` with 81.21, `CCCCSP(=O)(SCCCC)SCCCC` with 23.04).
*   **Presence of heavy atoms (Cl, Br, I):** Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, especially in highly chlorinated structures, tend to have significantly higher property values (e.g., `Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` with 3.26, `ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl` with 4.22, `ClC4=C(Cl)C5(Cl)C3C1CC(C2OC12)C3C4(Cl)C5(Cl)Cl` with 4.62).
*   **Presence of specific functional groups:** While not a clear linear relationship, some functional groups might contribute differently. For instance, highly branched or cyclic structures can have varying effects.
*   **Aromaticity vs. Aliphatic:** Aromatic compounds often have negative or slightly positive values, while highly aliphatic or saturated compounds can also vary.

The target molecule is `ClCCl`, which is dichloromethane. It is a small molecule with two chlorine atoms.

Let's compare `ClCCl` to some similar examples:

*   `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) has a value of `0.14412419`. This molecule is larger and has more chlorine atoms and a double bond.
*   `Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1` has a value of `-0.35850388`. This is an aromatic compound with two chlorines.
*   `Oc1cccc(Cl)c1` has a value of `0.04864546`. This is an aromatic compound with one chlorine.

Considering `ClCCl` (dichloromethane), it is a very small, simple molecule with two chlorine atoms. It's not aromatic. Its size and chlorine content are less than the highly chlorinated examples that show large positive values. It's also simpler than the aromatic chlorinated compounds.

Given its small size and the presence of two chlorine atoms, it's likely to have a value that is not extremely high or extremely low. It should be somewhat positive, similar to `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` but likely lower due to fewer chlorines and less complexity.

Based on the trend that more chlorines and more complex structures lead to higher values, and simpler structures with fewer chlorines are closer to zero or slightly positive/negative, `ClCCl` should fall into a range that is slightly positive.

Let's consider the simplest chlorinated molecule in the examples: `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` (tetrachloroethylene) is 0.144. Dichloromethane is smaller and has fewer chlorines. Therefore, its value should be less than 0.144.

Considering the general range of values for small molecules, and the impact of chlorine atoms, a small positive value is expected.

Predicted value: 0.05

The final answer is $\boxed{0.05}$

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 26.236017434602214
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist with expertise in molecular structures, I will analyze the provided examples and the target molecule to predict its property. The property values seem to be related to various molecular characteristics, including size, presence of heteroatoms, aromaticity, and functional groups.

Let's break down the target molecule:
`COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67`

This is a very complex molecule with multiple fused rings, ether linkages, hydroxyl groups, and a lactone (COC2=O). It also contains several methoxy groups (COc) and a methyl group (C). The presence of many oxygen atoms, particularly in cyclic ether and lactone forms, suggests a highly polar and potentially rigid structure. The multiple fused aromatic and aliphatic rings contribute significantly to its overall size and complexity.

Comparing it to the examples:
*   **Large, complex molecules with many rings and heteroatoms** tend to have higher positive values (e.g., `O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3` at 7.415, `CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO` at 8.903, `CCOC(=O)N(C)C(=O)CSP(=S)(OCC)OCC` at 9.379).
*   **Steroids and similar polycyclic structures** also show high positive values (e.g., `CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO` at 8.291, `CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C` at 6.625).
*   **Highly branched or long aliphatic chains** can also have high positive values (e.g., `CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC` at 21.559).
*   **Smaller, simpler molecules or those with halogens** often have values closer to zero or negative (e.g., `CCC(C)(C)CO` at -0.064, `ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl` at 0.144, `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` at 0.132, `CC1CCCC1` at -0.205).

The target molecule is exceptionally large and intricate, even more so than many of the high-value examples. It features a complex polycyclic system with numerous oxygen atoms, including multiple cyclic ethers and a lactone. The presence of methoxy groups and hydroxyl groups adds to its polarity and potential for intermolecular interactions. The overall structure suggests a very high molecular weight and a significant degree of structural complexity.

Given its immense size, multiple fused rings, and numerous oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, lactone, hydroxyls), the property value is expected to be significantly positive, likely in the higher range observed in the examples. It shares structural motifs with some of the steroid-like molecules and complex natural products that exhibit high positive values.

Considering the complexity and size, it should be higher than the 8-9 range seen for some steroids and even higher than the 9.379 for the organophosphorus compound. It's not as simple as a long alkane chain (21.559), but its intricate, oxygen-rich polycyclic nature suggests a very high value.

My prediction is based on the cumulative effect of its large size, high degree of cyclization, and the presence of multiple polar oxygen-containing functional groups, which are all characteristics associated with higher positive property values in the provided examples.
