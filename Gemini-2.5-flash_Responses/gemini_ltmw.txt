Predicted Property:
The molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 is a urea derivative with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. This structure suggests a relatively rigid and planar molecule due to the aromatic rings and the amide linkages.

    *   `NC(=S)N` (thiourea): -1019.89830684

The target molecule, O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, is diphenylurea. It contains a central urea group flanked by two phenyl rings.

Comparing with `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (306.60900209), which has one amide and one brominated phenyl, our molecule has two phenyl groups and a urea (two amides connected by a carbonyl). The presence of two aromatic rings and the urea linkage suggests a value that might be positive, similar to the amide examples.

Consider `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (29.31167827), which is a cyclic urea with an alkyl chain. This value is relatively small and positive.

The thiourea `NC(=S)N` has a very negative value (-1019.89830684), indicating that the sulfur substitution significantly changes the property compared to oxygen.

The molecule `O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2` has a molecular weight of 212.24 g/mol. It is a relatively rigid, planar molecule with significant pi-electron delocalization. The presence of two aromatic rings and the polar urea group will influence the property.

Let's look at the trend for increasing complexity with aromatic rings and polar groups:
*   `c1ccncc1` (-991)
*   `Cc1ccc(N)cc1` (-721)
*   `Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1` (-577)
*   `NC(=O)c1cccnc1` (-577)
*   `Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O` (-414)
*   `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (306) - This is a key one, an amide with an aromatic ring.
*   `ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1` (730) - More complex amide with two halogens.

The property seems to increase with the number of heavy atoms, halogens, and certain functional groups, especially amides and complex fused systems. The presence of two phenyl rings and a urea group suggests a value higher than simple amides with one ring, but likely not as high as highly halogenated or very large fused systems.

The value for `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` is 306.6. Our molecule has two phenyl rings and a urea group, which is essentially two amide-like bonds. This suggests a value that could be roughly double or more than a single amide with one ring, but without the heavy bromine atom.

Let's consider the contribution of the second phenyl group and the urea linkage. The urea group itself is a significant polar moiety.

Given the values for amides with aromatic rings (e.g., 306.6 for a bromo-substituted acetanilide) and the cyclic urea (29.3), the diphenylurea should have a positive value. The two phenyl rings contribute significantly to the molecular size and complexity.

A rough estimation based on the complexity and number of aromatic rings and polar groups would place it in the range of a few hundred to perhaps 800.

Let's consider the structure of diphenylurea. It has two N-C(O)-N linkages.
If `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` is 306.6, and it has one amide and one phenyl ring with a bromine.
Our molecule has two phenyl rings and a urea group. The urea group is more complex than a simple amide.

Let's try to find a pattern related to the number of aromatic rings and amide/urea groups.
*   `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (1 amide, 1 aromatic, 1 Br): 306.6
*   `C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1` (cyclic urea, no aromatics): 29.3

The target molecule has two aromatic rings and a urea group. It's more complex than the cyclic urea and has more aromaticity than the bromo-acetanilide.

The property values seem to be related to the overall molecular complexity, polarity, and possibly specific interactions. The presence of two phenyl rings will increase the value compared to a single phenyl ring.

Given the range of values, especially the positive ones for more complex and substituted aromatic amides, a value in the range of 400-700 seems plausible.

Let's consider the contribution of each part:
- Two phenyl groups: contribute to size and aromaticity.
- Urea linkage: polar, hydrogen bonding capabilities.

If a single amide with a brominated phenyl is ~300, then two phenyls and a urea might be higher.
The absence of heavy halogens like Br or multiple Cl atoms (which lead to very high positive values like 655 or 1275) suggests it won't be extremely high.

Let's estimate based on the "building blocks".
A single phenyl group might contribute around -300 to -400 (e.g., `Cc1cccc2ccccc12` is -384, `Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12` is -249).
However, when combined with polar groups, the values shift.

The value for `CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (306.6) is a good reference. It has one phenyl, one amide, and one bromine.
Our molecule has two phenyls and a urea. A urea is like two amides sharing a carbonyl.

Let's consider the increase from a simple aromatic to an aromatic amide.
`Cc1ccc(N)cc1` (toluidine) is -721.
`CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1` (bromo-acetanilide) is 306.
The addition of an acetyl group and a bromine significantly increases the value.

For diphenylurea, the two phenyl groups are directly attached to the nitrogen atoms of the urea. This conjugation and the overall size will contribute.

I'll estimate a value that reflects the presence of two aromatic rings and the polar urea group, placing it higher than a single aromatic amide but not as high as highly halogenated compounds.

A value around 500-600 seems reasonable, considering the complexity and the positive trend for aromatic amides.

True Property: -268.5557504778958
Predicted Property:
I will analyze the provided examples to discern patterns between molecular structures and their associated property values. I will focus on features such as molecular size, presence of specific functional groups (e.g., halogens, oxygen-containing groups, nitrogen-containing groups), aromaticity, and branching. I will also consider the general range and distribution of the property values.

Based on the examples, it appears that:
*   Smaller, simpler hydrocarbons or those with single functional groups tend to have negative or smaller positive values (e.g., CBr, CCCCBr, CCCCCCCC(C)O, COCOC).
*   Molecules with multiple rings, especially fused rings, or complex polycyclic structures, tend to have larger positive values (e.g., CC2Nc1cc(Cl)c(cc1C(=O)N2c3ccccc3C)S(N)(=O)=O, CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO).
*   The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I, F) can influence the value, sometimes increasing it, especially in polyhalogenated compounds.
*   Oxygen-containing groups (alcohols, ethers, ketones, esters, carboxylic acids) and nitrogen-containing groups (amines, amides, heterocycles) also contribute to the property value, with their specific arrangement and number playing a role.

The target molecule is **CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2**.
This molecule is a bicyclic compound with a bridgehead alcohol. It has a relatively compact structure with two fused rings (a 5-membered and a 6-membered ring, if we consider the bridge). It contains only carbon, hydrogen, and one oxygen atom. It is not aromatic and does not contain halogens or nitrogen.

Let's compare it to some similar examples:
*   **CC1CCCO1** (a 5-membered ring ether): -923.63521645
*   **CCCC(C)(C)O** (a branched alcohol): -769.35462113
*   **CC(C)(C)CO** (another branched alcohol): -904.24796468
*   **CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C** (a complex polycyclic alcohol/ketone): 1291.57948233
*   **CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO** (a complex polycyclic alcohol/ketone with fluorine): 2022.27500023

The target molecule is simpler than the very large polycyclic examples but more complex than simple linear or monocyclic alcohols/ethers. The presence of a bicyclic structure suggests a value that might be less negative or even positive compared to simple alcohols, but not as high as the highly functionalized or very large polycyclic systems.

Considering its size (C9H16O) and bicyclic nature with one hydroxyl group, it falls into an intermediate complexity range. The values for simple alcohols are around -700 to -900. The complex polycyclic ones are in the thousands.

The bicyclic structure might lead to a slightly higher value than simple open-chain or monocyclic alcohols.

Let's estimate based on the general trend:
*   Simple alcohols: ~ -800
*   More complex structures start moving towards 0 or positive values.

Given the bicyclic nature and the single oxygen, it's likely to be less negative than simple alcohols, but not largely positive like the very complex molecules.

I will estimate a value that is less negative than the simple alcohols but still within a negative range, or slightly positive, reflecting its compact bicyclic structure.

Predicted property value: -350.0

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 678.4768784543612
Predicted Property:
The provided examples show a correlation between the complexity and size of a molecule and its property value. Larger, more complex molecules tend to have higher (less negative or more positive) property values, while smaller, simpler molecules tend to have lower (more negative) property values. Halogenated compounds, especially those with multiple halogens, often show higher property values.

Let's analyze `BrC(Br)Br` (Tribromomethane or Bromoform).
*   It is a relatively small molecule.
*   It contains three heavy bromine atoms, which are known to increase molecular weight and often lead to higher boiling points and densities, which might correlate with this "property".
*   Comparing it to `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` (146.19), which is slightly larger but has lighter halogens (F, Cl), `BrC(Br)Br` is expected to have a higher value due to the heavier bromine atoms.
*   Comparing it to `Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl` (2049.77) or `Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl` (1387.28), these are much larger and more complex, so `BrC(Br)Br` should be significantly lower.
*   Comparing it to `Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1` (239.36), which is a larger aromatic system with one bromine, `BrC(Br)Br` has three bromines but is much smaller overall. The presence of multiple heavy atoms often contributes significantly.
*   `Ic1cccc2ccccc12` (691.35) is a large aromatic system with one very heavy iodine.

Considering the presence of three heavy bromine atoms in a small molecule, it should have a positive value, likely higher than simple monohalogenated alkanes or small molecules with lighter halogens, but much lower than large polyhalogenated aromatic systems.

Given `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` is 146.19, and bromine is heavier than fluorine and chlorine, a molecule with three bromines, even if smaller, should have a higher value.

Let's estimate based on the trend:
*   `FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br` (1 C, 3 F, 1 Cl, 1 Br) -> 146.19
*   `BrC(Br)Br` (1 C, 3 Br)

The increase in atomic mass from F/Cl to Br is substantial. The property seems to increase with molecular weight and the number of heavy atoms, especially halogens.

A reasonable prediction would be significantly higher than 146.19, but not in the thousands like the large polyhalogenated aromatics. It should be in the range of a few hundred.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -269.78668709829134
Predicted Property:
The provided examples show a wide range of property values, and the relationship between the molecular structure and the property is not immediately obvious from a simple visual inspection. The values seem to be influenced by factors such as the number of atoms, the presence of specific functional groups, and the overall complexity and rigidity of the molecule.

Let's analyze the given molecule: `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2`

This molecule is a bicyclic compound with a spiro center. It contains two amide groups and a cyclopropane ring.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar complexity and functional groups tend to have values in a certain range. For instance:
*   `CCCOC(=O)CC` (ester) is -634.88.
*   `CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3ccccc23` (complex amide/heterocycle) is 674.49.
*   `OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O` (complex amide/heterocycle with Cl) is 1005.31.
*   `ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O` (complex amide/ketone with Cl) is 1446.26.

The target molecule `O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2` is a relatively small, rigid, and highly functionalized molecule. It has a molecular weight that would be on the lower side compared to many of the larger examples, but the presence of multiple carbonyl and amide groups, along with the strained cyclopropane ring, suggests a value that might not be extremely negative like simple alkanes or alcohols.

Considering the examples, values for smaller, more functionalized molecules (like amides or small heterocycles) are often in the range of -500 to +1500. The presence of multiple oxygen and nitrogen atoms, and the cyclic structure, often leads to less negative or even positive values compared to simple hydrocarbons.

Given its size and the presence of three carbonyl groups and two nitrogen atoms within a fused ring system, it's likely to have a value that is not highly negative. It's more complex than a simple ester but less complex than some of the large polycyclic or halogenated compounds.

Let's try to estimate based on the "density" of functional groups and rings.
The molecule has 3 C=O, 2 N-H, and 2 rings (one 5-membered, one 3-membered).

Comparing to `CCCOC(=O)CC` (-634.88), which has one ester group, our molecule has more functional groups and a more constrained structure.
Comparing to `CCN2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3ccccc23` (674.49), which has two amide-like groups and three rings, our molecule is smaller but also has a high density of functional groups.

I'll estimate a value that is positive, reflecting its complexity and functionalization, but not as high as the very large, highly substituted molecules.
