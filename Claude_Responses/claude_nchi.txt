SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.4683691482210056
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the given examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester of a long-chain fatty acid (methyl decanoate).

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl dodecanoate) has a value of 0.88928874
- Longer chain aliphatic compounds tend to have higher values than shorter chains
- Esters generally show moderate positive values
- The presence of the ester group (C(=O)OC) contributes to a positive value
- The length of the carbon chain (10 carbons) would place this molecule's value slightly lower than the C12 example

Considering these factors, I would predict a value of approximately 0.75 for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC.

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's shorter than the C12 example by two carbons
2. Maintains the same functional group
3. Should have slightly lower lipophilicity
4. Falls within the general range of similar compounds in the training set

True Property: -0.35655063576705465
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and patterns.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is a benzoxazinone derivative with:
- A chlorine substituent
- A fused bicyclic system
- An oxazinone ring (containing O, C=O, and NH)
- Aromatic character

Looking at the training examples:
1. Molecules with similar structural elements like aromatic rings and halogens tend to have values around -0.1 to 0.7
2. The presence of oxygen and nitrogen in cyclic systems typically reduces the value somewhat
3. Fused ring systems generally contribute to slightly higher values
4. The combination of aromatic character with polar groups (C=O, NH) tends to moderate the value

Considering these factors and comparing to similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.15

This prediction takes into account:
- The moderating effect of the oxazinone ring
- The contribution of the chlorine substituent
- The fused bicyclic aromatic system
- The presence of both polar and nonpolar regions in the molecule

Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite, a relatively small molecule with:
- A nitrite group (-N(=O)=O)
- An isopropyl group (CC(C)-)
- Similar in size to some of the smaller molecules in the training set

Looking at patterns in the training data:
1. Small molecules generally have negative values

3. Simple aliphatic molecules with similar size (like CCCOCC: -0.74623344, CCCCCl: -0.7389403) have values around -0.7 to -0.8
4. Molecules containing N(=O)=O group (like Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO: -0.34747893) provide some reference

Based on these observations and the structural features, I would predict the property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O to be approximately:

-0.52

This prediction takes into account that it's a small molecule (pushing towards negative values) but has some branching and the nitrite group which might increase the value slightly compared to simple linear molecules.

5. Similar in complexity to the steroid example in the training set: CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C (which had a value of 2.24760288)

Based on these observations and patterns from the training data:
- Complex polycyclic structures tend to have higher positive values
- Presence of oxygen-containing groups slightly reduces the value
- Steroid-like structures show values around 2.0-2.3
- The molecule is very similar to the steroid example in the training set

1. A heterocyclic ring structure with two nitrogen atoms
2. Two carbonyl groups (C=O)
3. A bromine substituent
4. Alkyl groups (ethyl and methyl)
5. Medium-sized molecule with moderate complexity

Looking at similar structures in the training set:

- Heterocyclic structures with nitrogen tend to have values between 0 and 1
- The presence of carbonyl groups and alkyl substituents typically contributes to a slightly positive value

Taking all these factors into consideration, and noting that this molecule has moderate complexity but isn't extremely large or lipophilic, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.31

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.0812632521679324
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The target molecule (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) is biphenyl - two benzene rings connected directly to each other.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have negative values
2. Larger aromatic systems tend to have higher positive values
3. The complexity and size of the molecule generally correlates with higher values
4. Molecules with similar structural features to biphenyl (like fused ring systems) have moderately positive values

Biphenyl is:
- A relatively simple aromatic system
- Contains no heteroatoms
- Has two connected benzene rings
- Is smaller than many of the complex polycyclic aromatics in the examples
- More complex than single ring systems

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple aromatics with alkyl substituents have values around -0.2 to 0.0
- Fused ring systems have higher values (0.4-1.0)
- The connectivity and size seems comparable to some simpler examples

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict the property value for biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) to be approximately:

0.15

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCS - butanethiol) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1) It's a relatively small, linear molecule
2) Contains a sulfur atom at the terminus
3) Has a short alkyl chain (4 carbons)
4) No complex functional groups, rings, or branching

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account that:
1) It's simpler than most molecules in the training set
2) Similar-sized molecules tend to have negative values
3) The sulfur atom would likely increase the value slightly compared to a pure hydrocarbon
4) The linear structure without branching tends to correlate with more negative values in the training set

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.4352254269787946
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCC(C)(C)CO) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO:
1. It's an alcohol with a branched carbon chain
2. Contains a hydroxyl group (-OH)
3. Has similar structural elements to some training examples like CCCC(C)(C)C and CC(C)CC(C)O

Analyzing similar molecules from the training set:

- CC(C)CC(C)O has a value of -0.61356697
- CCCC(C)(O)CC has a value of -0.38703611

This molecule is most similar to these examples, but with some key differences:
- It has a terminal hydroxyl group
- It has a branched structure similar to CCCC(C)(C)C
- The presence of OH typically makes the value less negative compared to pure hydrocarbons

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The hydroxyl group will increase the value compared to CCCC(C)(C)C
2. The branching pattern will make it somewhat similar to other branched alcohols

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.18901153844896226
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to make a prediction.

The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is methylnaphthalene, which consists of:
- A naphthalene core (two fused benzene rings)
- A methyl (CH3) substituent

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (dimethylnaphthalene) has a value of -0.01110999
- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (methylanthracene) has a value of 0.40477282
- Simple benzene (c1ccccc1) has a value of -0.95314229

The target molecule is most similar to dimethylnaphthalene, but with one less methyl group. The presence of fused rings tends to increase the value compared to single rings, while having fewer alkyl substituents tends to decrease the value slightly.

Based on these patterns and considering that our molecule has:
1. The same basic naphthalene core as some training examples
2. One methyl group (less than dimethylnaphthalene)
3. Similar overall structure but simpler than methylanthracene

I would predict a value of approximately 0.15 for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1.

True Property: 0.6311160785229293
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and my understanding of molecular structures.

The target molecule is a barbituric acid derivative with an alkyl substituent and an alkene group. Looking at similar structures in the training examples:

1. O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a value of -0.20288578
2. This is the most similar structure to our target, differing only by having an additional propyl group

Key observations:
- The core structure (barbituric acid) is identical
- Both have a CC=C group
- The main difference is the additional alkyl chain length
- Generally, longer alkyl chains tend to slightly increase the property value

Given that the base structure (with just methyl) has a value of -0.20288578, and considering that additional alkyl groups typically increase the value moderately, I would predict the property value for O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C to be approximately:

-0.05

This prediction takes into account:
- The base barbituric acid structure
- The slight positive contribution from the longer alkyl chain
- The presence of the alkene group
- The overall molecular size and polarity

2. The size is relatively small, similar to some simpler aromatics in the training set
3. Contains fluorine atoms, which affect polarity and electronic properties
4. Has a similar core structure to some of the simpler aromatic compounds shown

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple substituted benzenes tend to have values between -0.7 and 0.0
- Halogenated aromatics like Clc1ccc(I)cc1 have a value of -0.25608038
- The presence of multiple halogens tends to make the value less negative

Based on these patterns and considering that CF3 is a strong electron-withdrawing group but also contributes to lipophilicity, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account that the CF3 group would likely make the value less negative than simple chloro- or bromo-benzenes, but the molecule is still relatively small and not as complex as many of the higher-value compounds in the training set.

2. It's similar in structure to OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO (which has a value of -0.32944566)
3. Both molecules have:
   - Multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups
   - An oxygen in the ring/chain
   - Similar carbon backbone length
   - Similar molecular weight

The key differences are:
- The query molecule is cyclic while the reference molecule is linear

Based on these observations and the similarity to the reference molecule (OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, -0.32944566), I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account the slightly more compact cyclic structure while maintaining the highly polar nature of the molecule.

3. Has multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (acetate ester, ketone, hydroxyl groups)
4. Contains multiple chiral centers
5. Has a similar core structure to some of the training examples, particularly the steroid-like molecules

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C has a value of 2.09499321
- CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C has a value of 2.54721826

The target molecule is more functionalized than these examples but shares the same core structure. It has additional oxygen-containing groups which might slightly modify the property value.

Based on these observations and the general trends in the training set where:
- More complex steroid structures tend to have values between 2.0-2.6
- Additional oxygen-containing groups tend to slightly increase the value
- The presence of conjugated systems affects the value

I predict the property value for CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C to be approximately:

2.31

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to other steroids in the training set while considering the additional functional groups present in the molecule.

Considering these factors:
- The structural complexity is similar to other polycyclic compounds in the dataset
- The presence of both ketone and hydroxyl groups will contribute to the property
- The overall carbon framework and substitution pattern is comparable to other steroid-like molecules

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

2. It has a nitro group (-NO2)
3. These groups are para to each other on a benzene ring
4. The molecule has both electron-withdrawing groups (NO2) and a group capable of hydrogen bonding (NHCOCH3)

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- Simple nitrobenzene (O=N(=O)c1ccccc1) has a value of -0.74291872
- Other molecules with nitro groups tend to have values ranging from -0.5 to 0.5
- The addition of the acetamido group would likely increase the value slightly due to its polar nature and hydrogen bonding capability

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is more complex than simple nitrobenzene but less complex than many of the larger molecules in the dataset that have higher positive values. The combination of the nitro and acetamido groups would likely result in a value less negative than nitrobenzene but still in the negative range.

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict the property value for O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 to be approximately:

0.05 (±0.1)

This prediction takes into account the molecule's symmetry, the presence of the urea bridge, and the two phenyl rings, placing it slightly positive but close to zero based on the patterns observed in the training data.

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 0.1462185789908266
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 is fluorene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) consisting of two benzene rings connected by a five-membered ring.

Looking at the training examples:
1. Similar PAH structures like phenanthrene (c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1) has a value of 0.82065564
2. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values between -0.8 and 0.8
3. The complexity and size of this molecule is less than phenanthrene but more than simple benzene derivatives
4. The molecule has structural similarity to other fused ring systems in the training set

Based on these observations and patterns, particularly comparing with similar PAH structures and considering its relative size and complexity, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.45

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is smaller than phenanthrene (which has value 0.82065564) but larger than simple aromatic compounds, and considers the general trend of similar structures in the training set.

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 0.3615842025315878
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 has several key features:
1. Contains a sulfonamide group -S(=O)(=O)-
2. Has an aromatic ring (benzene)
3. Contains multiple nitrogen atoms including amino groups (-NH2)
4. Has a guanidine-like structure (-NC(=N)N-)

- Presence of sulfonamide groups tends to increase the value
- Aromatic systems with polar substituents generally have moderate values
- Multiple nitrogen-containing functional groups tend to lower the value somewhat
- The molecule is neither very lipophilic (like long alkyl chains) nor very small/simple

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.35 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has some features that would increase the value (aromatic ring, sulfonamide) balanced by features that would decrease it (multiple polar groups, amino substituents).

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.9070838399621644
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the given molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, I notice:

1. It contains nitro groups (N(=O)=O)
2. Has a trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)
3. Contains an alkene group (C=C)
4. Has a tertiary amine structure
5. Contains a substituted benzene ring

Analyzing similar structures from the training set:

- Complex substituted aromatics generally have positive values
- Multiple electron-withdrawing groups tend to push the value higher

Taking into account these structural features and comparing with the training examples, I would predict a property value of approximately:

1.15

This prediction is based on:
- The molecule's complexity being similar to other medium-sized aromatic compounds
- The presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and trifluoromethyl)
- The alkene and amine functionalities
- The overall size and substitution pattern of the molecule

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -1.0113102921632682
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, a relatively simple ester.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Small molecules generally have negative values
2. Molecules with C=O (carbonyl) groups, especially in esters, tend to have negative values
3. Similar structures like CC(C)CCOC=O has a value of -0.60671347
4. Other simple esters and molecules with similar size/functionality show negative values
5. The presence of oxygen atoms and carbonyls in small molecules tends to make the value more negative

Based on these patterns and considering:
- The molecule's small size
- The presence of an ester group
- Similarity to other molecules in the training set
- The branching pattern (isopropyl group)

I predict the property value would be approximately: -0.85

This prediction takes into account that this molecule is smaller than CC(C)CCOC=O (-0.60671347) and similar in size to some other small oxygenated molecules in the training set that have values in this range.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.5508872788980608
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethyl phenol:
- It has a benzene ring as the core structure
- Contains two methyl (C) substituents
- Has one hydroxyl (O) group

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple phenol (c1ccccc1O) has a value of -0.89661683
- Methylated aromatics tend to increase the value slightly compared to unsubstituted variants
- The presence of hydroxyl groups generally decreases the value
- The molecule size is relatively small, suggesting a lower value
- It's similar in complexity to molecules like Cc1cccc(N)c1 (-0.69636351)

Taking all these factors into consideration, I would predict a value around:

-0.55

This prediction is based on:
1. Starting from the phenol baseline (-0.89)
2. Adjusting upward for the two methyl groups
3. Considering the overall molecular size and complexity
4. Comparing to similar structures in the training set

This is my best estimate based on the patterns observed in the training data and my chemical knowledge of structure-property relationships.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 1.7332116780370106
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has several key features:
1. It's an organophosphate compound with P=S group
2. Has methoxy groups (OC) attached to phosphorus
3. Contains an aromatic ring with methylthio (SC) and methyl (C) substituents
4. Has structural similarity to other organophosphate compounds in the training set

Looking at similar compounds in the training set:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (1.43031352)
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl (1.60500937)
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl (1.72528751)

These similar compounds have values ranging from 1.43 to 1.73. The target molecule has less electronegative substituents (SC and C vs Cl, Br, I) on the aromatic ring, which would likely decrease the value somewhat compared to these examples.

Based on these considerations and the overall patterns in the dataset, I predict the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 to be approximately:

1.35

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a positive value due to its organophosphate nature, but slightly lower than the chlorinated analogs due to less electronegative substituents.

Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.9340300778473065
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided.

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 5 chlorine atoms.

Looking at similar structures from the training set:
1. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl atoms) has value 1.13759242
2. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (7 Cl atoms) has value 1.34367315

The target molecule has:
- Biphenyl core structure (similar to references)
- 5 chlorine substituents (fewer than references)
- Similar spatial arrangement of chlorines
- Slightly less bulky than the reference molecules

Given that:
- The property values increase with more chlorine atoms
- The target has fewer chlorines than the reference molecules
- The basic structure is very similar
- The property seems to correlate with molecular size and halogen content

I predict the property value would be approximately 1.05

This value is:
- Lower than both reference PCBs (as it has fewer chlorines)
- Still significantly positive (due to size and halogen content)
- Proportionally scaled based on chlorine count and molecular similarity
==================================================
Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -1.0000820098527237
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O, propyl nitrite) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. It has a short carbon chain (3 carbons)
3. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - Simple alkanes (CCC) tend to have values around -1.2
   - Molecules with N(=O)=O groups tend to increase the value
   - Small molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups often have values between -0.6 and -0.3

Considering these factors:
- The base propyl chain would suggest a low value (around -1.2)
- The nitro group will increase this value significantly
- The size and polarity are similar to some other small functionalized molecules in the dataset

Based on these considerations and patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.71

This takes into account both the lowering effect of the small carbon chain and the increasing effect of the nitro group, while staying within the general range observed for molecules of similar size and functionality in the training set.

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.5354511716334298
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule and the given examples, I'll make a prediction based on observed patterns:

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobromobenzene with the substituents in meta position to each other. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of -0.37635852 (para-substituted halobenzene)
2. COc1cccc(Cl)c1 has a value of -0.5319338 (meta-substituted)
3. Clc1ccccc1Cl has similar halogen substitution pattern

The molecule in question:
- Has two halogens (F and Br) like some of the reference compounds
- Has meta substitution pattern
- F is generally less impactful on this property than Cl based on patterns
- Br typically contributes similarly across examples

Based on these observations and the general trends in the dataset, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.45

This takes into account that:
- The value should be negative based on similar aromatic halogenated compounds
- It should be between the values for dichlorinated and chlorobrominated compounds
- The meta substitution pattern typically gives values in this range
- Fluorine typically has a slightly moderating effect compared to chlorine

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 0.16812327709161948
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 has these key characteristics:
1. It's a bicyclic structure
2. Contains a hydroxyl (OH) group
3. Has multiple methyl substituents
4. Is relatively compact and saturated
5. Has moderate complexity but no aromatic systems

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with bicyclic systems tend to have moderate positive values
- Hydroxyl groups generally reduce the value somewhat
- Saturated ring systems without aromatics tend to have values between -0.5 and 1.0
- The complexity is less than the steroids in the training set (which had values >2)

Considering these factors and comparing to the most similar structures in the training examples, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.35

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is more complex than simple aliphatics (which have negative values) but less complex than the steroid-like structures (which have values >2). The presence of the hydroxyl group and the compact bicyclic nature suggests a moderate positive value in this range.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 1.7883022754994176
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features.

The target molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has several key features:
1. A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
2. Two ethoxy groups (OCC)
3. A phthalimide ring system
4. Similar overall size and complexity to some training examples

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O (3.14303423) - Very similar structure
- Other compounds containing phthalimide-like structures tend to have positive values
- Phosphorothioate containing compounds generally contribute to higher values

The target molecule is very similar to the training example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, but lacks the CCl group, which would make it slightly less lipophilic.

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

2.85

This value is slightly lower than the similar training example (3.14) due to the absence of the chloromethyl group, but still relatively high due to the presence of the phosphorothioate and phthalimide moieties.

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 0.10344670278809313
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a pyrazolone derivative with:
- A pyrazolone core (5-membered heterocycle with N-N and C=O)
- Two methyl groups (C) attached to nitrogens
- A phenyl ring (c2ccccc2) attached to one of the nitrogens
- A carbonyl group (C=O)

Looking at the training examples:
1. Molecules with heterocyclic structures containing N atoms generally have positive values
2. The presence of aromatic rings tends to increase the value
3. Molecules with C=O groups in cyclic structures often have values around 0.3-0.8
4. The size and complexity is moderate, similar to some examples with values in the 0.4-0.6 range

Considering these patterns and the structural similarities with molecules like:
- O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23 (0.42381087)
- CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2 (0.45008417)

I predict the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C to be approximately:

0.48

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate size, presence of aromatic and heterocyclic systems, and the carbonyl group in a cyclic structure.

True Property: -0.1261656184078501
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCC(=O)OCC - ethyl hexanoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Longer carbon chains tend to have values closer to 0 or slightly positive
2. Esters (C(=O)OC pattern) generally show moderate values
3. Simple linear molecules tend to have values between -1 and 1
4. The presence of oxygen atoms, especially in esters, tends to make the value less negative compared to pure hydrocarbons

Comparing with similar structures in the examples:
- CCCCCCCI (0.30959531)
- CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (0.25790935)
- CCOC(=O)N (-1.08248863)
- COC=O (-1.42471836)

The target molecule CCCCCC(=O)OCC is an ester with a moderate-length carbon chain. It's most similar to CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC but slightly shorter.

Based on these observations and the structural similarities, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account that it's an ester (which tends to increase the value compared to alkanes) but with a shorter chain than some of the similar examples, placing it in a moderate range between the more extreme values seen in the training set.
==================================================
Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.541828004145602
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples and analyzing the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1. This molecule is structurally similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) which has a value of -0.29452359
2. The only difference is that our target molecule has a methoxy (COC(=O)-) instead of ethoxy (CCOC(=O)-)
3. Generally, methyl esters tend to have slightly lower values than their ethyl counterparts
4. The molecule has a moderate size and contains an aromatic ring with an ester group
5. Looking at similar sized molecules with aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups in the training set, they tend to have values in the negative range between -0.2 and -0.4

Based on these considerations, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.31

This prediction takes into account that it should be slightly more negative than the ethyl ester analog due to the shorter chain length, while maintaining similar overall molecular characteristics.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -1.1076226535009166
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (1,4-pentadiene) and predict its property based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have negative values
2. Molecules with double bonds generally have lower values than their saturated counterparts
3. Small, simple molecules typically have values between -1.0 and -0.5
4. The example CC/C=C/C (2-pentene) has a value of -0.9421821
5. C=Cc1ccccc1 (styrene) has a value of -0.69738859

The target molecule C=CCC=C:
- Is a small hydrocarbon
- Has two double bonds
- Is similar in size to 2-pentene but with an additional double bond
- Has no complex functional groups
- Is relatively symmetric

Based on these observations and considering that additional unsaturation typically leads to slightly lower values, I would predict the property value for C=CCC=C to be approximately:

-0.91

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Close to the value of 2-pentene (-0.9421821)
- Slightly higher than very simple molecules like CBr (-0.9683118)
- More negative than aromatic hydrocarbons
- In line with other small, unsaturated hydrocarbons

- It's similar to other trihalomethanes
- Bromine atoms typically contribute to slightly higher values than chlorine or fluorine
- The molecule is relatively symmetric and compact

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for BrC(Br)Br to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Less negative than FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br (-0.68199896) due to having heavier halogens
- More negative than most aromatic halogenated compounds
- In line with other small halogenated aliphatic compounds

1. The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl)
- A phthalimide ring system
- Ethoxy groups (OCC)

2. Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
- Molecules with P=S tend to have higher values (like the example with COP(=S))
- Presence of chlorine typically contributes moderately
- Complex ring systems with carbonyls tend to increase the value
- The overall size and complexity is similar to some examples with values around 2-3

3. Comparing specifically to:
COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, 2.78058575
- This is the most similar structure in the training set, containing P=S and similar functional groups

Based on these considerations and the structural similarities to existing examples, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1. The molecule contains several key structural features:
- A urea linkage (N-C(=O)-N)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring
- A heterocyclic ring system with N-N and O linkages
- A tert-butyl group
- N,N-dimethyl substitution

2. Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Molecules with urea-like structures tend to have values around 0.3 to 0.8
- Chlorinated aromatics typically contribute positively to the value
- Complex heterocycles with multiple heteroatoms often increase the value
- Bulky groups like tert-butyl generally increase the value
- The overall size and complexity of the molecule suggests a higher value

3. Considering the molecular weight and complexity compared to the training examples, and the presence of multiple functional groups that tend to increase the property value.

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.28

This prediction takes into account the molecule's relatively large size, presence of multiple functional groups, and similarity to other complex structures in the training set that showed moderate to high positive values.

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 0.6500406559007541
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has:
- A diphenyl ether core structure
- Three chlorine substituents
- One hydroxyl group
- Multiple aromatic rings

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl (-0.49201053) - has similar hydroxyl and chlorine pattern
- c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2 (0.1197807) - has diphenyl core structure
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 (0.32586144) - has multiple chlorines and biphenyl system

The target molecule combines features of these compounds but is more complex due to the ether linkage and the specific arrangement of substituents. It should have a value intermediate between the simpler chlorinated phenols and the larger biphenyl systems.

Based on these considerations and the observed patterns, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.28

This prediction takes into account:
- The increased molecular size compared to simple chlorophenols
- The presence of the ether linkage
- The multiple chlorine substituents
- The hydroxyl group which typically reduces the value
- The overall structural similarity to other aromatic compounds in the dataset

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.9421820977970831
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this problem as a chemist:

1) The target molecule CC/C=C\C is a pentene (C5H10) with a trans (E) configuration at the double bond, while one of the example molecules CC/C=C/C is the same compound but with a cis (Z) configuration.

2) Looking at the example molecule CC/C=C/C which has a property value of -0.9421821, this appears to be the closest structural analog to our target molecule.

3) Generally, cis/trans isomers have similar physical and chemical properties, with trans isomers typically being slightly more stable and having slightly lower values for properties like solubility due to their more linear arrangement.

4) Looking at other examples in the dataset, smaller hydrocarbon molecules tend to have negative values, and the presence of double bonds doesn't dramatically change this pattern.

5) Given that this is a trans isomer of the example molecule that has a value of -0.9421821, I would expect the value to be very similar but slightly lower.

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value for CC/C=C\C to be approximately:

-0.95

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to the cis isomer and the typical small differences between cis/trans isomers.

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- Simple aliphatic molecules tend to have negative values
- Longer chain alkanes like C1CCCCCC1 have values around -0.32
- Simple molecules with oxygen tend to be slightly less negative than pure hydrocarbons
- The complexity and size of the molecule tends to make values more positive

Considering these patterns and the molecule's structural features, I would predict a value around:

-0.55

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's a relatively simple molecule (pushing towards negative values)
2. Contains an oxygen (slightly increasing the value compared to pure hydrocarbons)
3. Has a moderate carbon chain length
4. Lacks any complex structural features that would push it towards positive values

- The presence of C=O groups tends to moderate the value
- Larger, more complex structures generally have higher values than simple ones

Based on these patterns and the structural similarity to other molecules in the training set, particularly those containing N-C(=O)-N linkages and multiple aromatic rings, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.15

This prediction takes into account the molecule's size, complexity, and functional group composition relative to the training examples.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.10815805611694088
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is acetanilide with a bromine substituent (4-bromoacetanilide).

Looking at the patterns in the training set:
1. Molecules with bromine substituents on benzene rings tend to have values around -0.5 to -0.7
2. Molecules with amide groups (-NH-C(=O)-) typically increase the value slightly
3. Para-substituted aromatics show consistent patterns
4. Similar structures like Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of -0.52087702

Considering these factors:
- The base acetanilide structure would contribute a slightly negative value
- The bromine substituent in para position would push it more negative
- The amide group would moderate the negative effect somewhat

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 to be approximately:

-0.48

This prediction takes into account the structural similarities with other molecules in the training set and the general trends observed for similar functional groups and substitution patterns.

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.18404397970285755
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, which is isobutylbenzene) by comparing it with the training examples and looking for structural similarities and patterns.

Key observations:
1. It's a benzene ring with an isobutyl substituent
2. Similar compounds in the training set include:
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethyltoluene): -0.37141989
- Cc1cccc2ccccc12 (methylnaphthalene): -0.18649315
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (p-cymene): -0.21032744

The target molecule is simpler than many of the complex structures in the dataset, and it follows the pattern of other monosubstituted benzenes. It has a branched alkyl group, making it slightly more lipophilic than simple ethylbenzene derivatives, but not as much as larger aromatic systems.

Based on the patterns in the training data, where:
- Simple aromatic compounds with alkyl substituents tend to have values between -0.2 and -0.4
- Branching slightly increases the value compared to linear chains
- The size of the molecule influences the value

I predict the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 to be approximately:

-0.28

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Less negative than ethyltoluene (-0.37)
- Similar to but slightly more negative than p-cymene (-0.21)
- More negative than larger aromatic systems

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.7700165893561809
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice that:
1. Simpler aromatic structures tend to have negative values
2. The presence of oxygen-containing groups (especially C=O) tends to make values more negative
3. Single-ring aromatics with simple substituents generally fall in the -0.8 to -0.2 range
4. Benzaldehyde has a structure similar to some of the simpler examples but with an aldehyde group

Comparing specifically to similar structures:
- COc1ccccc1 (anisole) has a value of -0.73297775
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (salicylamide) has a value of -0.61903469
- Simple benzene derivatives generally show negative values

Given that benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) has:
- A single aromatic ring
- A simple carbonyl substituent
- Similar complexity to the reference molecules

I predict the property value would be approximately: -0.65

This prediction takes into account that it's slightly less polar than salicylamide but more polar than simple alkylbenzenes, placing it in a reasonable range based on the training examples.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.08071928672108382
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains a furan ring (5-membered oxygen heterocycle) with a nitro group
2. It has a cyclic urea structure (dihydropyrimidine-2,4-dione core)
3. Contains a hydrazone linkage
4. Has multiple polar groups (C=O, NO2)
5. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
   - Contains nitrogen heterocycles (like some training examples)
   - Has similar polarity to some compounds
   - Size is moderate (not too small or large)
   - Contains both aromatic and non-aromatic portions

Comparing with the training examples:
- Compounds with similar size and polarity tend to have values around 0 to 0.6
- The presence of NO2 group tends to increase the value
- Heterocyclic compounds with multiple heteroatoms often have values in the 0.2 to 0.7 range

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.32

This prediction takes into account the molecule's structural features, polarity, size, and similarity to the training examples while considering the general trends observed in the dataset.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.12919654258735747
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is a hydrazine derivative with two phenyl rings. Looking at similar structures in the training examples:

1. N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (azobenzene) has a value of 0.08593173
2. Other diphenyl-containing structures generally have values between 0 and 1
3. The target molecule differs from azobenzene only in having NH instead of N=N

The presence of the NH group (compared to N=N) would likely make it slightly more polar and reduce the property value somewhat compared to azobenzene.

Based on these structural considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.02 to 0.04

My specific prediction is: 0.03245

This value reflects that it should be:
- Slightly lower than azobenzene (0.086)
- Higher than simple aniline (-0.869)
- In the range typical for moderately complex aromatic compounds

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 has these key characteristics:
1. It's a cyclic imide structure
2. Contains a cyclopentane ring fused to the imide
3. Has multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)
4. Relatively compact and symmetric structure
5. Contains no aromatic rings or halogens

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1 (0.07463613) - similar cyclic structure
- O=C1CCCN1 (-0.88527703) - similar lactam structure
- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC (0.58507177) - very similar core structure

The target molecule is most similar to the last example, but slightly smaller and more symmetric. It should have a property value between the cyclic imide examples, but likely closer to the positive values due to its rigid structure and multiple C=O groups.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.42

This prediction takes into account the molecule's structural similarity to other cyclic imides in the training set while considering its unique structural features.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.5269053902798572
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the given training examples. The target molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine substituents.

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have positive values (e.g., Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl at 1.29603875)
2. Simple dichlorobenzene (Clc1ccccc1Cl) has a value of -0.54853599
3. Biphenyl-like structures generally show higher values than single ring systems
4. The presence of multiple halogens tends to increase the value

Given these patterns and considering:
- The molecule has a biphenyl core (which typically increases the value)
- It has three chlorine substituents (which would increase the value compared to dichlorobenzene)
- Its structural similarity to other chlorinated aromatics in the training set

I would predict a value of approximately 0.65 for this molecule. This value would place it:
- Higher than dichlorobenzene (-0.54853599) due to the additional chlorine and larger structure
- Lower than the pentachlorinated biphenyl derivative (1.29603875) due to fewer chlorines
- In a reasonable range for a trichloro-substituted biphenyl system

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values between -0.7 and 0.3
2. The presence of ethyl groups typically increases the value slightly
3. Similar structures like CCCCCCc1ccccc1 has a value of 0.29755452

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The target molecule is sulfanilamide (a sulfonamide drug)
2. Looking at structural patterns from examples:
   - It has an aniline-like structure (NH2-phenyl) similar to "Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O" which has a value of -0.65900473
   - Contains a sulfonamide group S(N)(=O)=O instead of nitro group
   - It's relatively small and polar like many of the negative-value compounds
   - Has similar polarity characteristics to some other aromatic amines in the dataset

3. Comparing with similar structures:
   - Nitroaniline has value -0.65900473
   - Simple aromatic compounds tend to be in the -0.6 to -0.9 range
   - Polar substituents tend to decrease the value
   - The sulfonamide group is more polar than a nitro group

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training examples, I would predict a value of approximately:

2. Similar structures in the training set:
   - c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 (methylated PAH) = 1.00107558
   - c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 (larger PAH) = 1.14138211
3. The target molecule is smaller than these examples but follows the same pattern of fused rings

Considering these factors:
- It's a pure hydrocarbon PAH
- It's smaller than the example PAHs
- It has a similar conjugated system
- It lacks substituents that might alter the property significantly

Based on this analysis and the pattern in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately:

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 0.8280164053794498
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule and the given examples, I'll make a prediction based on several key observations:

1) The molecule contains multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups, similar to some examples with lower values
2) It has a complex ring system with fused rings and an oxygen bridge
3) Contains a ketone group (C=O)
4) Has structural similarity to flavonoid-type compounds
5) The overall size and complexity is moderate
6) Contains multiple aromatic rings with hydroxyl substitutions

Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
- Molecules with multiple -OH groups tend to have lower values
- Complex ring systems typically increase the value
- The presence of oxygen-containing functional groups moderates the value
- Similar sized molecules with aromatic systems tend to fall in the middle-positive range

Taking all these factors into account, and comparing with the most similar structures in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is more complex than simple phenols (which have negative values) but less complex than the larger polycyclic systems (which have values >2). The multiple hydroxyl groups would lower the value somewhat, but the complex ring system and ketone group would increase it.

- The presence of sulfur tends to increase the value slightly
- Smaller molecules generally have lower values than larger, more complex ones
- Acetamido groups tend to decrease the value somewhat
- The combination of P=O and S is somewhat similar to some pesticide-like structures in the training set

Taking all these factors into consideration, and noting that this molecule is relatively small but has several polar functional groups, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has features that would increase the value (P=O, S) but is smaller and has groups that would moderate that increase (acetamido, methoxy).

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Smaller, simpler molecules tend to have negative values
2. Halogenated small molecules like chlorobenzene (Clc1ccccc1) have values around -0.75
3. Very small molecules like acetonitrile (CC#N) have more negative values around -1.5

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and my understanding of molecular structures.

The molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is 1,4-dibromobenzene, which has:
- A benzene ring as the core structure
- Two bromine atoms in para position

Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
1. Halogenated benzenes are present in several examples
2. Dihalogenated compounds tend to have values around -0.5 to 0.5
3. The closest structural analogs might be:
   - Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl (0.32334305)
   - ClCCl (-1.12000851)

Considering that:
- Bromine is slightly larger and more lipophilic than chlorine
- The symmetrical para substitution pattern is similar to some examples
- The molecule is relatively simple compared to many examples

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 to be approximately:

- Other aromatic compounds with multiple halogens show similar trends

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.65

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Lower than 1.95939696 (the 10-chlorine example)
- Still significantly positive due to the multiple chlorine substituents
- In line with other halogenated aromatic compounds in the dataset

Looking at the training examples, I notice several patterns:
1. Longer chain hydrocarbons tend to have values closer to 0 or slightly negative
2. Simple alcohols tend to be more negative (around -0.7 to -1.0)
3. Complex aromatic structures tend to be positive
4. The more complex and larger the molecule, the more positive the value tends to be

Specifically looking at similar structures in the training set:

2. A pyrimidine ring (cncnc)
3. A central carbon with an OH group
4. Multiple aromatic systems connected by a single carbon center

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with multiple chlorinated aromatics tend to have positive values
- The presence of OH groups typically reduces the value somewhat
- Complex multi-ring systems with heteroatoms generally have values between 0.5 and 1.5
- The presence of both polar (OH, N) and nonpolar (Cl, aromatic) groups suggests moderate value

Considering these factors and comparing to similar structures in the training set (especially those with chlorinated aromatics and heterocycles), I would predict a property value of approximately:

1.05

This prediction takes into account:
- The structural similarity to other chlorinated aromatic compounds
- The presence of the polar OH group
- The complexity of the molecule
- The presence of the pyrimidine ring system
- The overall balance of polar and nonpolar regions

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.7564943627345757
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CCCCOC=O is a formate ester with a butyl chain.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCCC(=O)OCC (ethyl butyrate) has a value of -0.54708521
- CCCCCC=O (hexanal) has a value of -0.59491558
- Simple esters and aldehydes generally show negative values
- The length of the alkyl chain seems to make the value less negative
- Oxygen-containing compounds with similar size tend to have values in this range

Based on these observations, particularly considering:
1. The similar size and functional groups
2. The presence of oxygen atoms
3. The length of the alkyl chain
4. The overall structural similarity to other esters and aldehydes in the training set

I predict the property value for CCCCOC=O to be approximately -0.57

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly smaller than ethyl butyrate but has a similar structure to both the ester and aldehyde examples in the training set.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -1.1200085114355047
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) by comparing it to the training examples and looking for similar structural patterns and properties.

Looking at the training data, I notice:
1. Small halogenated molecules tend to have negative values
2. The most similar molecule in the training set is "ClCCCl" which has a value of -0.90954872
3. ClCCl is smaller than ClCCCl by one carbon
4. Other small, halogenated molecules like CCBr have similarly negative values (-0.91280264)

Given that:
- ClCCl is very similar to ClCCCl but slightly smaller
- Small halogenated molecules consistently show negative values around -0.9
- The molecule has similar polarity and electronic properties to other dihalogenated compounds in the training set

I would predict a property value of approximately -0.92 for ClCCl.

This prediction takes into account that it's slightly smaller than ClCCCl but maintains similar electronic properties, leading to a slightly more negative value but in the same range as similar molecules in the training set.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a dimethylphenol (two methyl groups on a phenol ring).

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (-0.15128359) - very similar structure with methyl groups and OH
- Oc1cccc(O)c1 (-0.84009137) - phenol with different substitution

- Has slightly different substitution pattern
- Is slightly less bulky

I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.18

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a value close to but slightly more negative than its closest analog due to its smaller size and different substitution pattern.

2. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (6 chlorines) has value 1.13759242

The target molecule has:
- Biphenyl core structure (like the reference molecules)
- 4 chlorine substituents (less than both reference molecules)
- Similar substitution pattern
- Slightly less chlorination than the reference molecules

Given that:
- The property value increases with more chlorination
- The target has fewer chlorines than both reference molecules
- The values for 5 and 6 chlorines are 0.939 and 1.138 respectively
- The target has 4 chlorines, so should be slightly lower

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -1.1200085114355047
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (dichloromethane, CH2Cl2) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a very small molecule with just two carbons and two chlorines
2. Looking at similar small halogenated compounds in the training set:
   - ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a value of -0.73519566
   - Simple chlorinated compounds tend to have negative values
3. The molecule is smaller and simpler than most examples
4. It has similar polarity characteristics to tetrachloroethylene but is smaller
5. The molecule lacks any complex functional groups or aromatic systems

Based on these observations, particularly comparing it with similar small halogenated compounds in the training set, and considering its size and simplicity, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.85

This prediction takes into account that:
- Small molecules generally have more negative values
- Chlorinated compounds in the training set tend toward negative values
- The molecule is simpler than tetrachloroethylene which has -0.73519566

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.2859297943322667
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms in specific positions.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (very similar, just different chlorine positions) has a value of -0.28844818
2. Other halogenated aromatics like Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 has a value of 0.17407714

The target molecule is most similar to the first reference compound, with the same number of chlorines and a hydroxyl group on a benzene ring. The only difference is the position of the chlorine atoms.

Given that:
- The molecular weight and overall polarity will be very similar
- The substitution pattern is slightly different but maintains similar electronic effects
- The compound has the same functional groups (OH and Cl)

I would predict a value very close to the similar trichlorophenol, with a small adjustment for the different substitution pattern.

My prediction for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl would be approximately: -0.25

This takes into account that the chlorine positioning might slightly affect the property but should maintain very similar characteristics to the reference compound.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.4754030430300521
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples.

Looking at the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, I notice:
1. It contains a heterocyclic ring structure with multiple nitrogen atoms
2. Has a thioether (CSc-) group
3. Contains a carbonyl group
4. Has a t-butyl substituent (C(C)(C)C)
5. Has an amino substituent (-N)

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.2945235917532981
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ethyl benzoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple molecules tend to have negative values
2. Aromatic rings with substituents tend to have values around -0.5 to 0.5
3. The presence of ester groups (C(=O)O) tends to make values slightly negative
4. The size and complexity of the molecule affects the value

For CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate):
- It has a benzene ring (similar to many examples)
- Contains an ethyl ester group
- Relatively simple structure compared to many examples
- Similar in complexity to some molecules that have values around -0.3 to 0

Based on these observations and comparing to similar structures in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.25

This prediction takes into account that it's more complex than simple molecules (which have more negative values) but simpler than the highly positive complex structures, and considers the presence of the ester group which tends to contribute to slightly negative values in the training set.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.13949632952630053
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (1-bromoheptane, CCCCCCCBr) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Longer chain alkyl halides tend to have slightly positive values
2. Simple linear molecules generally have values between -0.5 and 0.5
3. The presence of bromine (comparing with Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 at 0.0138635) tends to give values close to 0
4. Similar length alkyl chains (like CCCCCCC=C at -0.31182778) provide useful reference points
5. The molecule is similar in size and polarity to some of the aliphatic examples

Considering these factors, particularly comparing with similar linear molecules and taking into account the bromine substituent, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's a linear molecule (generally giving moderate values)
- It has a bromine terminal group (slightly increasing the value compared to pure hydrocarbons)
- It's similar in length to examples like CCCCCCC=C (-0.31182778) but the Br should give a slightly higher value than the double bond
- It's less polar than many of the highly positive compounds in the training set

SMILES: CO
True Property: -1.6067405018213043
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

CO (methanol) is one of the simplest organic molecules containing a single carbon with a hydroxyl group. Looking at the training examples, I observe that:

1. Small, simple molecules generally have negative values
2. Molecules with hydroxyl groups (-OH) tend to decrease the value
3. Very short carbon chains typically have more negative values
4. The examples show that simpler structures like CCC (propane) have a value around -1.19
5. Molecules with oxygen generally contribute to more negative values when combined with short carbon chains

Given these patterns and considering that methanol (CO) is:
- A very small molecule
- Has a single carbon
- Contains a hydroxyl group
- Is simpler than most negative examples in the training set

I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-1.15

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- More negative than longer chain alcohols
- Similar to but slightly less negative than propane (CCC)
- More negative than longer chain molecules with OH groups
- In line with the general trend of simple, small molecules having negative values
