- c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 (anthracene) has a value of 0.90056492
- Simple benzene derivatives tend to have values between -0.7 and 0.0
- Fused ring systems generally show slightly higher values than single ring systems

Given the structural features and comparing with similar molecules in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately 0.3 to 0.4 for fluorene.

My specific prediction is: 0.35

This takes into account that:
1. It's less complex than anthracene (value ~0.9)
2. More complex than simple benzene derivatives (values ~ -0.7 to 0)
3. Has a fused ring system which tends to increase the value
4. Contains no substituents which might dramatically alter the property

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -0.12269288004060708
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, I notice:
1. It contains a sulfonamide group -S(=O)(=O)-
2. Has multiple amino groups (-NH2)
3. Contains a para-substituted benzene ring
4. Has a guanidine-like structure (-NC(=N)N-)

Analyzing the training examples:
- Molecules with polar groups (like -NH2, -OH) tend to have values around -0.5 to 0.5
- Sulfonamide-containing compounds in the examples show moderate values
- Para-substituted benzenes typically don't contribute to extreme values
- Multiple polar groups tend to slightly increase the value

Based on these observations and the structural similarities with compounds in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.48 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account the molecule's polarity, size, and the presence of multiple hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, while comparing it to similar structural motifs in the training set.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 5.447090583974068
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule and the given examples, I'll make a prediction based on several key observations:

1. The molecule contains multiple electron-withdrawing groups (NO2 groups and CF3)
2. It has a tertiary amine structure
3. Contains both aliphatic and aromatic components
4. Has fluorine atoms in a CF3 group
5. The overall structure suggests moderate lipophilicity

Looking at the training examples:
- Similar sized molecules with NO2 groups tend to have values around -0.03 to 0.67
- Molecules with tertiary amines often show values around -0.7 to 0.2
- The presence of CF3 and multiple NO2 groups would likely push the value higher
- The alkyl substituents (ethyl groups) typically contribute to slightly negative values

Taking all these structural features into account and comparing with the patterns in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.31

This prediction takes into account the competing effects of the electron-withdrawing groups (which tend to increase the value) and the amine/alkyl portions (which tend to decrease it), while considering the overall molecular complexity and size.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.7035458645550379
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (isopropyl formate, CC(C)OC=O) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with ester groups (OC=O) tend to have negative values
2. Short-chain esters and similar small molecules often have values between -0.6 and -0.8
3. The closest structural analogs in the training set are:
   - CC(C)CCOC=O (value: -0.70370103)
   - CCCCCOC(=O)C (value: -0.68615564)

The target molecule CC(C)OC=O is:
- Smaller than these analogs
- Has similar functional groups
- Has branching at the carbon adjacent to oxygen (like the first analog)

Based on these observations and considering that smaller molecules with similar functional groups tend to have slightly more negative values, I predict the property value for CC(C)OC=O to be approximately:

-0.72

This prediction takes into account both the structural features and the general trends observed in the training data.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 0.42010111415071183
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethylphenol (specifically, a benzene ring with two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple phenol (c1ccccc1O) has a value of -0.21974714
2. Molecules with hydroxyl groups tend to have values between -0.2 and 0.6
3. Adding methyl groups to aromatic rings tends to shift values slightly higher
4. The complexity and size of this molecule is relatively simple compared to many examples

Considering these factors:
- The base phenol structure would suggest a starting point around -0.22
- The two methyl groups would likely shift the value slightly higher
- The overall structure is still relatively simple
- The molecule maintains similar polarity to simple phenol

Based on these considerations, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account that the additional methyl groups would likely make the molecule slightly more lipophilic than simple phenol, but the overall structural similarity to phenol would keep the value in a similar range.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: -0.5548166510911011
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has several key features:
1. It's an organophosphate compound with P=S group
2. Has methoxy groups (OC) attached to phosphorus
3. Contains an aromatic ring with methylthio (SC) and methyl (C) substituents

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has value -0.05784676
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has value -0.05784676
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has value -0.05784676

I notice that:
1. These similar compounds all have the same exact value
2. They share the same COP(=S)(OC)O- core structure
3. The main difference is in the aromatic ring substituents

The target molecule has less electronegative substituents (SC and C vs Cl, Br, I) but maintains similar electronic properties.

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value would be close to but slightly higher than -0.05784676, approximately:

-0.04000000

This takes into account the slightly less electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents while maintaining the core structural similarity to the training examples.

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 5 chlorine atoms.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a value of -0.74771043
2. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a value of -0.63144981
3. ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl has a value of -0.74506948

The target molecule is most similar to the first two examples, as they are all PCB structures. It has:
- Same basic biphenyl core
- 5 chlorine substituents (intermediate between some examples)
- Similar substitution pattern
- Similar molecular weight and size

Given these structural similarities and the property values of related molecules, I predict the property value for the target molecule to be approximately:

-0.70

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has slightly fewer chlorines than some reference compounds but maintains similar electronic and steric properties.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6830894145040554
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O, propyl nitrite) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. Contains a short carbon chain (propyl)
3. Has oxygen-containing functional group
4. Similar in size to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- Simple alkanes like CCC have higher values (around 6.35)
- Molecules with N=O groups tend to have moderate negative to positive values
- Short chain molecules with oxygen-containing groups often have values between -0.7 to 0.5
- The presence of nitro groups seems to contribute to slightly negative values in many cases

Considering these patterns and the molecule's structure, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's not as simple as pure alkanes (which have very high values)
2. Contains a nitro group (which tends to moderate the value)
3. Has a short carbon chain (which typically doesn't lead to extreme values)
4. Similar sized molecules with oxygen-containing groups often have values in this range

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobromobenzene, where fluorine and bromine are substituted at different positions on the benzene ring.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of -0.17974352
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 and similar dihalogenated benzenes have values around -0.4 to -0.7
- Other mono and disubstituted benzenes generally show negative values

Considering that:
1. Fluorine and bromine are both halogens like chlorine
2. The substitution pattern is meta (1,3) which is similar to some examples
3. The molecule has similar size and electronic properties to several training examples
4. Halogenated aromatics in the training set tend to have negative values

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 to be approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account that the value should be:
- Negative (like most halogenated aromatics)
- Similar to but slightly more negative than the chloro-bromo analog
- In the range typically seen for dihalogenated benzenes

1. The target molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic structure with:
- A hydroxyl group (-OH)
- Multiple methyl substituents
- A relatively compact bridged ring system

2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with bicyclic systems tend to have moderate positive values
- Presence of hydroxyl groups often contributes to positive values
- Compact, rigid structures generally show values between 0.5 and 2.0
- The complexity is moderate compared to the larger steroid-like structures that show very high values (>5)

3. The molecule is less complex than the steroid derivatives in the dataset (which have values around 6.0), but more complex than simple linear or monocyclic structures (which have values around -0.7 to 0.9)

Based on these considerations and the structural patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 to be approximately:

1.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate complexity, presence of the hydroxyl group, and its bridged bicyclic nature, while being significantly less complex than the steroid-like structures that show much higher values.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.3086994795126563
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the target molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, I notice:

1. It's structurally similar to CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O from the training set (which has a value of 0.48097791)
2. The main difference is the replacement of SC(CCl) with a direct bond
3. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S)
4. Has a phthalimide ring system
5. Contains ethoxy groups (OCC)

Considering these factors:
- The removal of the SC(CCl) group would likely decrease the value slightly
- The core structure maintains similar electronic properties
- The molecule maintains similar polarity characteristics

Based on the structural similarities and differences with the training example, and considering the general trend of values in the training set for molecules with similar functional groups, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.42

This prediction takes into account that the value should be slightly lower than 0.48097791 (the similar training example) due to the simpler structure, but maintaining a similar range due to the preserved core functionalities.

Iteration: 34
SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -0.7462032461579974
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The target molecule is a heterocyclic compound containing a pyrazolone ring with phenyl and methyl substituents.

2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- It has some similarity to compounds containing aromatic rings and nitrogen heterocycles
- The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) in a cyclic system

- Contains both aliphatic (methyl) and aromatic substituents

3. Analyzing the patterns in the training data:
- Molecules with similar heterocyclic structures tend to have values in the negative range
- N-containing heterocycles often show values between -0.2 and -0.7
- The presence of carbonyl groups often contributes to negative values
- Phenyl substitution patterns typically don't push values to extremes

Based on these considerations and the structural similarities with the training set molecules, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.45

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.1035530205797704
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCC(=O)OCC - hexyl propionate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule and the training set, I notice:
1. It's an ester with a medium-length carbon chain
2. Similar compounds with linear carbon chains and ester groups show moderate positive values
3. The presence of the ester group (C(=O)O) typically contributes to a slightly positive value
4. The length of the alkyl chains on both sides of the ester group affects the value
5. Comparing to similar structures in the training set like CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (-0.43981837)

Taking these factors into consideration, and noting that this molecule is slightly shorter than the similar example but maintains the same functional group pattern, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.15

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's less hydrophobic than the longer chain example
- The ester group contribution remains similar
- The overall molecular size and complexity is moderate
- The balance between the polar and non-polar portions of the molecule

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.652621767484337
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is methyl benzoate, a relatively simple aromatic ester.

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) has a value of -0.74813753
- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 (with an additional OH group) has a value of -0.74773216

The query molecule is very similar to ethyl benzoate, just with a methyl ester instead of an ethyl ester. This small difference in chain length typically doesn't cause major changes in this property. The core structure (benzoic acid ester) is the same.

Given these structural similarities and the very close values for similar compounds, I would predict a value of approximately -0.75 for COC(=O)c1ccccc1.

My specific prediction is: -0.74800000

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The property values for similar esters are very close to this range
2. The methyl ester would behave very similarly to the ethyl ester
3. The absence of additional substituents keeps it in line with the simple benzoate structure

The target molecule C=CCC=C has:
- Two terminal double bonds
- A simple aliphatic chain
- Similar size to some of the simpler examples
- No functional groups besides alkenes

Considering these factors, and particularly noting that:
1. It's structurally similar to CC/C=C/C but with an additional double bond
2. Simple hydrocarbons in the dataset tend to have values between -0.7 and 1.7
3. The presence of double bonds seems to push values toward the negative side

I would predict a value of approximately -0.65 for C=CCC=C.

This prediction takes into account that it should be slightly less negative than CC/C=C/C due to the additional unsaturation, but still maintain a negative value due to its simple hydrocarbon nature and multiple double bonds.

I would predict a value of approximately 4.2 for CBr3H.

This prediction takes into account that the value should be:
- Higher than simple organic molecules (which are mostly negative or near zero)
- Lower than complex phosphates and highly oxygenated compounds
- Similar to but slightly higher than other trihalogenated compounds

- Multiple aromatic rings

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl (0.45215791) - has similar hydroxyl and chlorine pattern
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 (-0.69656667) - has similar biaryl system

The target molecule combines features of these compounds but has:
- More chlorine atoms than the first reference
- An ether linkage instead of direct biaryl coupling
- A hydroxyl group that the biaryl references lack

Considering these structural features and their contributions, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.52

This prediction takes into account:
- The positive contribution from hydroxyl and chlorine substituents
- The effect of the ether linkage
- The overall size and complexity of the molecule
- The patterns seen in similar structures from the training set

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.6931339204719137
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice this is a molecular property prediction task. The target molecule CC/C=C\C is a cis-2-pentene, which is very similar to CC/C=C/C (trans-2-pentene) that appears in the training examples with a value of -0.69313392.

The only difference between these molecules is the stereochemistry of the double bond (cis vs trans). Given that these molecules are isomers with very similar physical and chemical properties, and considering the general pattern in the data where similar structures tend to have similar values, I would predict that the property value for CC/C=C\C would be very close to its trans isomer.

Therefore, I predict the property value for CC/C=C\C to be approximately:

- CC(C)COC(=O)C (-0.11258062)
- Simple ethers tend towards negative values

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict the property value for CCCOCC to be approximately:

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6435393776544228
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 (isobutylbenzene), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1. The molecule contains a benzene ring with an isobutyl substituent
2. Similar structures in the training set include:
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.60267334)
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.5785916)

3. Key patterns I notice:
- Simple alkylbenzenes tend to have values between -0.3 and -0.6
- Branching near the aromatic ring tends to make the value slightly less negative
- The size of the alkyl group has some influence but not dramatically

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to other molecules in the dataset, I would predict the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 to be approximately:

-0.54

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly more branched than ethylbenzene but has similar overall characteristics to other alkylbenzenes in the dataset.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.3229306793273984
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple aromatic structures tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. The presence of oxygen-containing groups (like aldehydes) tends to slightly increase the value
3. Single-ring aromatics with simple substituents generally have moderate values
4. Benzaldehyde has a relatively simple structure with one aromatic ring and one aldehyde group

Analyzing similar structures from the examples:
- COc1ccccc1 (anisole) has a value of -0.6820098
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (salicylamide) has a value of 0.35360788
- Simple aromatic compounds generally have values close to 0 ± 1

Given that benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) has:
- One aromatic ring
- One aldehyde group (similar in polarity to other oxygen-containing groups)
- Similar complexity to the reference molecules

I predict the property value would be approximately: -0.15

This prediction takes into account that benzaldehyde is slightly more polar than benzene but less than salicylamide, and considers the general trends seen in the training data for similar aromatic structures with oxygen-containing substituents.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 1.794468598913165
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains a furan ring (5-membered oxygen heterocycle) with a nitro group
2. It has a cyclic urea structure (dihydropyrimidine-2,4-dione core)
3. Contains a hydrazone linkage
4. Has multiple polar groups (C=O, NO2)
5. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
   - Contains nitrogen heterocycles (like some training examples)
   - Has similar polarity to some compounds
   - Contains NO2 group like some examples
   - Has oxygen-containing heterocycles

Based on the structural features and comparing with similar molecules in the training set, particularly those containing heterocycles and polar groups, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of polar groups
- The heterocyclic nature
- The overall molecular size
- Similar structural motifs from the training set
- The balance between polar and non-polar regions

This is my best estimate based on the patterns observed in the training data and my chemical expertise.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 2.751610692049669
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training examples, which has a value of 1.14647044. The only difference is that our target molecule has an NH linkage instead of a N=N linkage.

Looking at patterns in the training data:
1. Molecules with two phenyl rings connected by nitrogen-containing bridges tend to have values around 0.5 to 1.5
2. The presence of NH groups typically slightly reduces the value compared to N=N groups
3. The molecule maintains similar conjugation and electronic properties to its azo analog

Given these considerations and the structural similarity to the azo compound (N=N linkage) with value 1.14647044, but accounting for the reduced conjugation due to the NH linkage, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.95

This prediction takes into account that the NH linkage would slightly lower the value compared to the N=N analog, but the core diphenyl hydrazine structure would still maintain a relatively high value in the same general range.

True Property: 0.2763226386238775
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The target molecule is a cyclic imide structure with a cyclopentane ring fused to it
2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

4. The target molecule has:
   - A cyclic imide core (similar to some training examples)
   - A fused cyclopentane ring
   - Overall moderate molecular weight and complexity

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.15

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly more complex than the simple cyclic structures but less complex than the larger molecules in the training set that showed higher values.

5. Looking at similar compounds:
   - Clc1ccccc1Cl has a value of 0.26249479
   - Other chlorinated aromatics show moderate positive to slightly negative values

Taking into account these structural features and patterns, and considering the complexity and size of the molecule, I would predict a property value of approximately:

Looking at the given examples and the target molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 (diethylbenzene), I can make several observations:

1. The molecule is a benzene ring with two ethyl groups in para position
2. It's a relatively simple, symmetric hydrocarbon
3. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
   - CCCCCCc1ccccc1 (hexylbenzene) has a value of 1.1569079
   - Cc1ccccc1N (methylaniline) has a value of 0.26249479
   - Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values between -1 and 2

The target molecule is less complex than hexylbenzene but more symmetric and has two ethyl groups instead of one long chain. It's more lipophilic than methylaniline due to lack of polar groups.

Based on these patterns and the general trend of similar structures in the dataset, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The value should be positive (like most simple aromatics in the set)
2. It should be lower than hexylbenzene but higher than simple substituted benzenes
3. The symmetry and two ethyl groups likely contribute to a moderate value

- A sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O)
- Para substitution pattern

Looking at similar structures in the training set:

- The sulfonamide group is similar in polarity to a nitro group

Considering these factors:
1. The base aromatic structure is similar to the nitroaniline example
2. The sulfonamide group is slightly less electron-withdrawing than nitro
3. The presence of two amino groups will increase polarity

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for sulfanilamide to be approximately:

   - "c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54" (a larger PAH) has value 1.4169265

Pyrene is smaller than some of these examples but has a similar conjugated aromatic system. It lacks substituents that might significantly alter the property.

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to other PAHs in the dataset, I predict the property value for pyrene to be approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account that it's a pure PAH system, smaller than some examples but larger than simple aromatics, and considers the general trend of similar structures in the training set.

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: 0.8959686295939893
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples and molecular patterns.

The molecule "Cc1cccc(C)c1O" is a dimethylphenol (specifically, a dimethyl-substituted phenol with two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a benzene ring).

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
1. "CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O" (value: 0.06530943) - This is also a methylated phenol
2. "Oc1cccc(O)c1" (value: 0.0) - Basic dihydroxybenzene structure
3. "Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O" (value: -0.0325989) - Similar core with different substituent

The target molecule is most similar to the first example, but with a slightly simpler structure. It has:
- One hydroxyl group (like example 1)
- Two methyl groups (similar to example 1)
- A benzene ring core

Given these similarities and considering the values of related structures, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.05

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly simpler than example 1 but maintains similar functional groups and overall structure.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.6940586713022613
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 4 chlorine atoms. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (6 chlorines) has value -0.69660029
2. Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (5 chlorines) has value -0.72195317

The target molecule has:
- Biphenyl core structure (similar to examples)
- 4 chlorine substituents (fewer than examples)
- Similar symmetrical distribution of chlorines
- Similar electronic and steric effects

Given that:
1. The structures with more chlorines have values around -0.7
2. Our target has fewer chlorines but similar core structure
3. The property appears to be somewhat proportional to chlorination
4. The values for similar aromatic chlorinated compounds tend to be negative

I predict the property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl would be approximately:

-0.68

This prediction takes into account that it should be slightly less negative than the more chlorinated examples but still in a similar range due to the structural similarity.
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.30401663867870554
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule (CC=C(C)C, which is 2-methylbut-2-ene), I'll make a prediction based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice that:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. Molecules with double bonds generally have slightly higher values than their saturated counterparts
3. Branched molecules with similar size tend to have values close to 0
4. The molecule in question is a small, branched alkene with 5 carbons

Analyzing similar structures from the examples:
- CCCCCCCCC=C (dec-1-ene) has a value of -0.75128844
- CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C (branched alkane) has a value of 1.10900717
- Simple aromatic compounds have values around 0.2 to 0.3

Given that this molecule (CC=C(C)C) is:
- Smaller than most examples
- Contains a double bond
- Has branching
- Is relatively simple in structure

I predict the property value would be approximately:

0.32

This prediction takes into account the molecule's small size, presence of a double bond, and branching pattern, placing it in a reasonable range based on the observed patterns in the training set.
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 6.353743853520958
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a very small molecule with just two carbons
2. It has two chlorine atoms
3. It's symmetric
4. It has no complex functional groups
5. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a value of 4.68268496 but is more chlorinated
   - Simple halogenated compounds tend to have moderate positive values
   - Small molecules generally have values between -1 and 5
   - Symmetric molecules with halogens often show positive values

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately 2.1 for ClCCl.

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's simpler than tetrachloroethene (value ~4.68)
- It has fewer chlorines than many of the higher-valued chlorinated compounds
- It's more halogenated than simple hydrocarbons (which tend to have values around 0 or slightly negative)
- Its symmetry and size suggest a moderate positive value

Therefore, my predicted property value for ClCCl is 2.1

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 1.5418384097681992
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms in specific positions.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (very similar, just different chlorine positions) has value 1.31344384
2. Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 (trihalogenated benzene) has value 0.42010111
3. Other halogenated compounds show varying values but generally positive

The target molecule is most similar to the first reference compound (Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl), as both are trichlorinated phenols. The only difference is the position of the chlorine atoms. Given this very close structural similarity and considering the general trends in the dataset, I would predict a value close to but slightly different from 1.31344384.

My prediction for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl would be approximately 1.28

This takes into account:
- Very similar structure to the reference compound
- Slight variation due to different chlorine positions
- General trends of halogenated aromatics in the dataset
- Presence of hydroxyl group
- Overall molecular size and substitution pattern

1. The molecule contains multiple key structural features:
- Multiple methoxy groups (OC)
- A phenol group (OH)
- Multiple ether linkages
- A lactone ring
- A methylenedioxy group (OCO)
- Multiple fused rings
- Several oxygen-containing functional groups
- Complex stereochemistry

2. Looking at the training examples:
- Complex molecules with multiple oxygen-containing groups and fused rings tend to have values between 1 and 6
- Molecules with similar natural product-like structures (like steroids) show values around 5-6
- The presence of multiple oxygen atoms tends to moderate the value

3. This molecule appears to be a complex natural product derivative (possibly related to podophyllotoxin or similar lignans), and such structures in the training set typically show moderate positive values.

Based on these considerations and the structural patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

2.84

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, oxygen content, and similarity to other complex natural product-like structures in the training set.

1. The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A thioether group (CS-)
- A triazine ring with a carbonyl group
- A hydrazine substituent (-N-N)
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

2. Looking at similar structural patterns in the training examples:
- Molecules containing heterocyclic rings with nitrogen atoms tend to have values around -0.5 to 0.5
- The presence of sulfur-containing groups often contributes to moderate positive values
- Molecules with tert-butyl groups typically show values around 0 to 0.5
- The hydrazine substituent might contribute to a slightly negative value

3. The most similar compounds in the training set are:

Based on these considerations and the structural similarities with the training examples, I predict the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C to be approximately:

0.28

This prediction takes into account the balance between the slightly positive contribution of the sulfur and tert-butyl groups, and the moderating effect of the nitrogen-rich heterocycle.

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of the ester group
- The aromatic ring system
- The overall molecular size
- The similarity to other compounds in the training set with comparable functional groups
- The general trend that similar sized aromatic esters tend to have slightly negative values

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.531120609793543
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (1-bromoheptane, CCCCCCCBr) by comparing it with the given examples and looking for patterns in molecular structure and corresponding property values.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple linear alkyl chains tend to have values close to 0 or slightly negative
2. Halogenated compounds (especially Br, Cl) often have values around -0.5 to -0.7
3. The length of carbon chains affects the value, with longer chains generally having values closer to -0.5 to -0.7

Most relevant examples from the training set:
- CCCCCCC=C (heptene) has value -0.68555259
- CCCCCCCO (heptanol) has value -0.53112061
- Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (bromonaphthalene) has value -0.68611365

Given that CCCCCCCBr is:

SMILES: CO
True Property: 17.007403896547604
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

CO (methanol) is one of the simplest organic molecules, containing just a methyl group (-CH3) bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH). Looking at the training examples:

1. Small molecules generally have values between -1 and 1
2. Alcohols in the training set tend to have slightly negative values:
   - CCC(C)CO: -0.74756739
   - CCCC(O)CCC: -0.52170833
   - CC(O)c1ccccc1: -0.65933234

3. The simplest molecules in the set (like CCC, CCBr) tend to have more extreme values, but those are more complex than methanol

Given that methanol is:
- A very simple molecule
- Contains an alcohol group
- Has no complex structural features

I predict the property value for CO (methanol) to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account that it's simpler than most alcohols in the training set but follows the general trend of alcohols having negative values in this property space.
