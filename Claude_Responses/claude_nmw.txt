True Property: 0.03958230569959946
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the given examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester of a long-chain fatty acid (methyl decanoate).

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Longer carbon chains tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. Esters (C(=O)OC group) typically increase the value slightly
3. The most similar molecule in the examples is CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC which has a value of 0.30936899
4. This molecule is slightly shorter (10 carbons vs 12 in the example)

Considering these factors:
- The backbone is similar to the C12 ester but shorter
- The functional groups are identical
- The shorter chain length would likely decrease the value slightly

Based on this analysis, I would predict a value of approximately 0.15 for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC.

This prediction takes into account that the property value should be slightly lower than the C12 ester (0.30936899) due to the shorter chain length, while maintaining the general characteristic contribution of the ester group.

The target molecule appears to be a steroid-like structure with:
- Multiple ring systems (4 rings)
- Ketone groups (C=O)
- Hydroxyl group (OH)
- Several methyl substituents
- Complex cyclic structure

Looking at similar structures in the training set:

- The amide/urea linkages tend to decrease the value somewhat

Taking all these factors into consideration, and noting that this molecule has:
- Multiple halogens (2F, 1Cl) which would increase the value
- Urea group which would moderate the value
- Medium-sized structure with balanced polarity

I predict the property value to be approximately: 0.32

This prediction takes into account both the halogen-increasing effects and the moderating influence of the urea group, placing it in a middle range similar to other medium-sized halogenated aromatic compounds in the training set.

1. A heterocyclic ring structure (pyrimidine-dione core)
2. A bromine substituent
3. Alkyl groups (ethyl and methyl)
4. Two carbonyl groups
5. An NH group

Looking at the training examples:

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.26895003486411656
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The molecule "c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2" is biphenyl - two benzene rings connected directly to each other.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have negative values
2. Aromatic systems generally have higher values than their aliphatic counterparts
3. Larger conjugated systems tend to have higher positive values
4. The presence of heteroatoms and functional groups tends to increase the value
5. Biphenyl is relatively simple compared to larger PAHs in the examples, which have values >1

Considering these factors:
- It's an aromatic system (pushing value up)
- It has no heteroatoms (keeping value moderate)
- It's smaller than many PAHs in the examples
- It's more complex than single ring aromatics
- Similar conjugated systems in the examples tend to have values between -0.5 and 0.5

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) to be approximately:

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.8846202956012557
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCS - butanethiol) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1) It's a relatively small, linear molecule with a sulfur group
2) Looking at similar patterns in the training data:
- Simple linear alkanes tend to have negative values
- Small molecules generally have values between -1 and 0

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.634461277582868
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCC(C)(C)CO) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO:
1. It's an alcohol with a branched carbon chain
2. Contains a hydroxyl group (-OH)
3. Has similar structural elements to some training examples like:
- CCCC(C)(C)C (value: -0.92321208)
- CC(C)CC(C)O (value: -0.76935462)
- CCCC(C)(O)CC (value: -0.63446128)

Analyzing these similar structures:

- The chain length and branching pattern affects the value

Based on these observations and the trends in the training data, I would predict the property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO to be approximately:

-0.71

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It should be more negative than CCCC(C)(O)CC (-0.63446128) due to the geminal dimethyl groups
2. But less negative than CCCC(C)(C)C (-0.92321208) due to the presence of the OH group
3. Similar to CC(C)CC(C)O (-0.76935462) but slightly less negative due to the different branching pattern

Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to make a prediction.

The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is methylnaphthalene, which consists of:
- A naphthalene core (two fused benzene rings)
- A methyl (CH3) substituent

Looking at similar structures in the training set:

The target molecule is most similar to dimethylnaphthalene, but with one less methyl group. It should have a value between simple benzene (-1.00) and dimethylnaphthalene (-0.25), but closer to dimethylnaphthalene due to its similar size and structure.

Based on these comparisons and the observed patterns, I predict the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 to be approximately:

-0.42

This takes into account that it should be:
1. Less than dimethylnaphthalene (-0.24956278)
2. Higher than benzene (-1.00076109)
3. Similar to but slightly lower than other methylated aromatics in the training set

The target molecule is a barbiturate derivative with:
- A barbituric acid core (similar to O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C in the examples)
- Additional alkyl substitution (C(C)CCC) at the C1 position
- A CC=C group similar to the simpler example

Looking at the examples:
1. O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a value of 0.0
2. The addition of alkyl groups generally increases the value slightly
3. The core structure is identical to the reference compound
4. The only difference is the additional alkyl chain at the C1 position

Considering these factors:
- The base barbiturate structure contributes similarly to the reference
- The additional alkyl chain will increase lipophilicity slightly
- The CC=C group contribution remains similar

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.25

This value accounts for the slight increase due to the additional alkyl substitution while maintaining consistency with the core barbiturate structure's contribution.

- The presence of two phenyl rings typically increases the value somewhat

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.21 (±0.05)

This prediction takes into account the molecule's structural similarity to other compounds in the training set while considering its unique features like the symmetric nature of the molecule and the presence of both aromatic and urea-like components.

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: -0.1534439430862031
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and the target molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (which is fluorene), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1. The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic system with three rings (two benzene rings connected by a five-membered ring)
2. It's similar in structure to some of the other aromatic compounds in the training set
3. Looking at similar structures:
- c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 (anthracene) has a value of 0.44347377
- Simple benzene derivatives tend to have values between -0.7 and 0.0
- Fused ring systems generally show slightly higher values than single ring systems

Given the molecule's:
- Smaller size compared to anthracene
- Similar fused ring structure
- Lack of substituents
- Moderate lipophilicity

I would predict a property value of approximately 0.15 to 0.25

My specific prediction would be: 0.21

This takes into account that it's more complex than a single benzene ring but less extensive than anthracene, and considers the general trend that fused ring systems tend to have slightly positive values in this property scale.

The target molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 has several key features:
1. Contains a sulfonamide group -S(=O)(=O)-
2. Has an aromatic ring (benzene)
3. Contains multiple amino groups (-NH2)
4. Has a guanidine-like structure (-NC(=N)N-)

- Presence of sulfonamide groups typically contributes to positive values
- Aromatic systems with polar substituents generally show moderate positive values
- Multiple nitrogen-containing functional groups often lead to values around 0.5-1.0

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.65 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account the molecule's polarity, size, and functional group composition while comparing it to the general trends seen in the training data.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.4529571966072414
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the given molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, I notice:

1. It contains nitro groups (N(=O)=O)
2. Has a trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)
3. Contains an alkene group (C=C)
4. Has a tertiary amine structure
5. Contains a substituted benzene ring

Analyzing similar structural patterns from the training set:
- Molecules with nitro groups tend to have values around 0.3 to 1.0
- More complex structures with multiple functional groups tend to have higher values
- The presence of fluorine atoms typically increases the value
- Multiple electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and CF3) tend to push the value higher

Based on these observations and the complexity of the molecule, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

1.15

This prediction takes into account the molecule's relatively high complexity, presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups, and similarity to other molecules in the training set with comparable functional groups.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.9046710991444202
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CC(C)OC=O is a formate ester with a branched (isopropyl) structure.

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- CC(C)CCOC=O (formate ester) has value -0.63488441
- Simple esters and similar small oxygenated molecules tend to have negative values
- Branched alcohols like CC(C)(C)O have values around -0.90
- Small molecules with C=O groups like CCCC=O have values around -1.05

Given that this molecule:
- Is a small formate ester
- Has branching (isopropyl group)
- Contains an oxygen and C=O group
- Is smaller than CC(C)CCOC=O but has similar functional groups

I predict the property value would be approximately -0.85

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It should be negative based on similar small oxygenated molecules
2. It's smaller than CC(C)CCOC=O so might deviate somewhat from -0.63
3. The branching and ester group would likely put it in a similar range to other branched oxygenated compounds

True Property: -0.5771169411186523
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethyl phenol:
- It has a benzene ring as the core structure
- Contains two methyl (C) substituents
- Has one hydroxyl (O) group

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple phenol (c1ccccc1O) has a value of -0.84690363
- Methylated aromatics like CCc1ccccc1C tend to have values around -0.59608106
- Adding hydroxyl groups generally increases the value slightly
- The size and complexity is relatively small, suggesting a negative value

Considering these factors:
- The base phenol structure suggests a negative value
- The two methyl groups will make it slightly less negative than plain phenol
- The overall structure is still relatively simple

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 to be approximately:

-0.65

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Less negative than plain phenol (-0.84690363)
- Similar to but slightly more negative than methylated aromatics (-0.59608106)
- Reflective of its relatively simple structure

True Property: 0.9247026693028908
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has several key features:
1. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)(OC)O-)
2. It's connected to an aromatic ring
3. Has methylthio (SC) and methyl (C) substituents on the aromatic ring
4. Contains similar structural elements to some pesticide-like compounds in the training set

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a value of 1.34027841
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has a value of 1.76775
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has a value of 2.21973454

The target molecule has a similar phosphorothioate core but with less electronegative substituents (SC and C instead of Cl, Br, or I). This would likely result in a somewhat lower value than these reference compounds.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value would be approximately:

1.15 ± 0.15

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a positive value due to its phosphorothioate structure, but lower than the chlorinated/brominated/iodinated analogs in the training set.

True Property: 1.3872848045706607
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has several key characteristics:
1. It contains multiple chlorine atoms (5 Cl atoms)
2. It has a biphenyl-like structure (two benzene rings connected)
3. The chlorines are distributed across both rings
4. It's a relatively large, complex aromatic structure

Looking at similar molecules from the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl, biphenyl structure) has value 1.71853177
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (7 Cl, biphenyl structure) has value 2.04977874
- ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl (6 Cl, single ring) has value 1.04488247

The target molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than the 7-Cl example (2.04977874)
- Similar to the 6-Cl biphenyl example (1.71853177)
- More complex/aromatic than the single ring example (1.04488247)

Based on these structural comparisons and the observed property values, I predict the property value for the target molecule to be approximately:

1.65

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has slightly fewer chlorines than the closest matching examples but maintains the biphenyl structure and multiple chlorine substitution pattern.
==================================================
Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.8951698071057409
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O, propyl nitrite) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. It has a short carbon chain (3 carbons)
3. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - Simple alkanes (CCC) tend to have values around -1.3
   - Molecules with N(=O)=O groups tend to increase the value
   - Small molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups often have values between -0.8 and -0.3

Considering these factors:
- The base propyl chain would suggest a low value (like CCC at -1.32)
- The nitro group will increase this value significantly
- The size and complexity is relatively low

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.65

This takes into account both the lowering effect of the small alkyl chain and the increasing effect of the nitro group, while considering the overall molecular size and complexity.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.06903823435797513
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a benzene ring substituted with both fluorine and bromine in different positions.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of 0.08920444 (dihalogenated benzene)
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 patterns show halogen substitutions affect the value
- Bromine-containing compounds tend to have slightly positive values
- Fluorine substitutions generally lead to lower values than chlorine or bromine

Considering these factors:
1. The molecule has a similar structure to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (0.08920444)
2. Fluorine typically has a smaller effect than chlorine
3. The meta-substitution pattern might slightly affect the value
4. The overall molecular size and halogen combination suggests a slightly positive value

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 to be approximately:

0.05 to 0.07, with my best specific prediction being 0.06234

This value reflects that it should be:
- Slightly positive
- Lower than the chloro-bromo analog
- Consistent with other halogenated aromatics in the training set

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.2685557504778958
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 has these key characteristics:
1. It's a bicyclic structure
2. Contains an alcohol (OH) group
3. Has multiple methyl substituents
4. Is relatively compact and saturated
5. Has moderate complexity but no aromatic systems

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with OH groups tend to have negative values when simple
- Bicyclic structures tend to increase the value
- The presence of multiple methyl groups moderates the value
- Compact ring systems without aromatics tend to have values around 0 to 0.5

Considering these factors and comparing to the most similar structures in the training set (especially other bicyclic compounds with OH groups), I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.15

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is more complex than simple alcohols (which have more negative values) but less complex than the steroid-like structures (which have values >1.5) in the training set.

1. A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
2. A phthalimide ring system
3. Ethoxy groups attached to phosphorus
4. Similar overall size and complexity to some training examples

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O (2.03561335) - Very similar structure
- Other compounds containing phthalimide-like structures tend to have positive values
- Compounds with P=S groups generally contribute to higher values
- The presence of ethoxy groups typically contributes moderately to the property

Considering these factors and the closest structural analog in the training set, but noting that this molecule lacks the CCl group which would likely increase the value, I predict the property value to be:

1.85

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a relatively high positive value due to its structural similarity to the training example at 2.03561335, but slightly lower due to the absence of the chloromethyl group.

- Has moderate polarity due to the carbonyl group
- Size is medium compared to the training set

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.42 to 0.48

My specific prediction would be: 0.45

This value takes into account the molecule's structural features and its similarity to other compounds in the training set, particularly other heterocyclic aromatic compounds with comparable complexity.

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCC(=O)OCC - ethyl hexanoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Longer chain esters tend to have values around -0.1 to 0.0
2. Simple aliphatic compounds with oxygen-containing functional groups generally have negative values
3. The presence of ester group (C(=O)O) typically leads to values less negative than corresponding alcohols
4. Similar compounds like CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC have a value of -0.09531104

Given that this molecule is:
- A medium-length chain ester
- Has similar structural features to other esters in the dataset
- Is slightly shorter than CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
- Contains no other functional groups

I predict the property value to be approximately: -0.35

This prediction takes into account that:

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.4426467320327675
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples and analyzing the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1. This molecule is structurally similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) which has a value of -0.30775339
2. The only difference is that our target molecule has a methyl ester (COC(=O)-) instead of an ethyl ester
3. Generally, methyl groups vs ethyl groups in similar structures tend to make compounds slightly more polar/less lipophilic
4. Looking at other similar patterns in the training set where methyl vs ethyl substitutions occur, the difference is usually small but noticeable

Based on these considerations, I would predict the property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 to be approximately:

-0.33

This prediction is slightly more negative than the ethyl benzoate analog, accounting for the shorter alkyl chain, while maintaining the overall property range observed for similar aromatic esters in the dataset.

- C=Cc1ccccc1 has a value of -0.75036165
- Simple hydrocarbons like C1CCCC1 has a value of -1.07749268

The target molecule C=CCC=C is:
- A small hydrocarbon (suggesting negative value)
- Has two double bonds (which would increase the value slightly compared to fully saturated analogs)
- Similar in size and complexity to CC/C=C/C, but with an additional double bond

Based on these observations, I would predict a value of approximately -0.95 for C=CCC=C.

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Less negative than CC/C=C/C (-1.07749268) due to additional unsaturation
- More negative than aromatic/conjugated systems
- In line with other simple hydrocarbons in the dataset

For BrC(Br)Br (tribromomethane):
- It's a small molecule
- Contains three bromine atoms

The target molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has:
- A diphenyl ether core structure
- Three chlorine substituents
- One hydroxyl group
- Multiple aromatic rings

Looking at similar structures in the training set:

- c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2 has a value of 0.06229693 (biphenyl with one chlorine)
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 has a value of 0.3935439 (biphenyl with two chlorines)

The target molecule is more complex than these examples but shares similar features. It should have a higher value than the dichlorophenol (-0.18440969) due to its larger size and additional chlorine, but likely lower than some of the more complex molecules in the training set.

Based on these structural considerations and the observed patterns, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.28

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of multiple halogens (typically increases the value)
- The ether linkage between rings
- The hydroxyl group (typically decreases the value)
- The overall molecular size and complexity

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -1.0774926773095086
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this problem as a chemist:

1) The given molecule CC/C=C\C is a pentene (C5H10) with a trans (E) configuration at the double bond, while one of the example molecules CC/C=C/C is also pentene but with a cis (Z) configuration.

2) Looking at the example molecule CC/C=C/C, its property value is -1.07749268

3) The only difference between our target molecule and the example molecule is the stereochemistry of the double bond (cis vs trans).

4) In general, trans isomers tend to have slightly lower values for many physical properties (like solubility, boiling point) compared to their cis counterparts due to their more linear and compact arrangement.

5) However, the difference between cis and trans isomers is usually relatively small for molecules of this size.

6) Given that the cis isomer has a value of -1.07749268, and considering the typical small differences between geometric isomers, I would predict the trans isomer to have a value very close to, but slightly lower than the cis isomer.

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value for CC/C=C\C to be approximately:

-1.09

This prediction takes into account the slight difference expected between geometric isomers while staying within a reasonable range of the known cis isomer value.

1. Smaller, simpler molecules tend to have more negative values
2. Molecules with oxygen atoms generally have moderately negative values
3. Linear alkyl chains with oxygen tend to have values between -0.5 and -1.0
4. The presence of ethers (C-O-C) appears to make molecules slightly less negative compared to alcohols

- Contains an ether group
- Has linear alkyl chains
- Similar in size and functionality to molecules like CC(C)COC(=O)C (-0.63488441)
- Simpler than many of the complex examples but more complex than very simple molecules like methane (-1.5976788)

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.71

This prediction takes into account that it's a simple ether, slightly larger than basic alcohols but smaller than complex molecules, and considers the general trend of similar structures in the training set.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.30660900209434755
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is acetanilide with a bromine substituent (4-bromoacetanilide).

Looking at the patterns in the training set:
1. Molecules with bromine substituents tend to have values around -0.1 to 0.0
2. Aromatic compounds with polar substituents (like -NH(C=O)R) typically have moderate values
3. Similar structures like Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of -0.08818507
4. The acetamide group (-NHC(=O)CH3) typically contributes to a slight increase in the property

Considering these factors:
- The base aromatic structure would contribute similarly to other benzene derivatives
- The bromine substituent would push the value slightly higher
- The acetamide group would contribute to a moderate increase

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 to be approximately:

0.12

This prediction takes into account the structural similarities with other molecules in the training set and the general trends observed for similar functional groups and substituents.

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.4611877148774779
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 (isobutylbenzene), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1. The molecule contains a benzene ring with an isobutyl substituent
2. It's similar in structure to other alkylbenzenes in the training set like:
   - CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.59608106)
   - Cc1cccc2ccccc12 (-0.38445613)
   - CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.46118771)

3. It's a relatively simple, non-polar molecule without any heteroatoms
4. The size and branching is comparable to other molecules in the dataset

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, particularly looking at similar alkylbenzene structures, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.52

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's likely to have a negative value like other simple aromatic hydrocarbons
- The value should be between the simpler and more complex alkylbenzenes in the training set
- The branching typically makes the value slightly less negative compared to linear chains

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.7313975364390304
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple aromatic structures tend to have negative values
2. The presence of oxygen generally contributes to more negative values
3. Small molecules with simple substituents tend to be more negative than complex ones
4. Aldehydes appear to be moderately negative in general
5. The benzene ring with a single substituent typically results in values between -0.7 and -0.3

Benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) has:
- A single benzene ring
- One aldehyde group (-CHO)
- Relatively simple structure
- Similar to some of the simpler aromatic compounds in the training set

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- COc1ccccc1 (anisole) has -0.71201028
- Simple benzene derivatives tend to be negative
- The aldehyde group should make it slightly less negative than anisole

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) to be approximately:

-0.52

This value takes into account the molecule's similarity to other simple aromatic compounds while considering the electronic effects of the aldehyde group.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.5383424375761869
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains a furan ring (5-membered oxygen heterocycle) with a nitro group
2. It has a cyclic urea structure (dihydropyrimidine-2,4-dione core)
3. Contains a hydrazone linkage
4. Has multiple polar groups (C=O, NO2)
5. Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
   - Molecules with nitro groups tend to have higher positive values
   - Heterocyclic compounds with multiple heteroatoms often have values around 0 to 1
   - The presence of multiple polar groups tends to moderate the value
   - Similar sized molecules in the training set with comparable polarity fall in this range

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.019839236311533896
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally very similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training examples, which has a value of 0.00045198. The only difference is that our target molecule has an NH linkage instead of a N=N linkage.

Looking at other patterns in the data:
1. Molecules with two phenyl rings connected by a small linking group tend to have values close to 0 or slightly positive
2. The presence of NH groups typically decreases the value slightly compared to their unsaturated counterparts
3. The overall size and complexity of the molecule is moderate, similar to other molecules with values around 0

Given these considerations, and particularly the very close structural similarity to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, I would predict a value slightly lower than 0.00045198 due to the additional NH group.

My prediction for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is approximately -0.05

This takes into account both the structural similarity to the azobenzene compound and the general trend that additional NH groups slightly decrease the property value.

True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 has these key characteristics:
1. It's a cyclic imide structure
2. Contains a cyclopentane ring fused to the imide
3. Has multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)
4. Relatively compact and symmetric structure
5. Contains no aromatic rings or halogens

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1 (0.02931168)
- O=C1CCCN1 (-0.93352118)
- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC (0.42406728)

The target molecule is most similar to these examples, particularly the last one, but is more compact and has a cyclopentane ring instead of alkyl chains.

Considering these factors and the general trends in the training data:
- Cyclic structures tend to increase the value
- Multiple C=O groups tend to give moderate positive values
- Compact structures without long chains tend to have values closer to zero
- The presence of the cyclopentane ring will increase the value somewhat

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.28

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is more complex than simple lactams but less complex than the larger fused ring systems in the training set.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.7247908687967501
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has the following key features:
1. It contains three chlorine atoms
2. It has two benzene rings connected directly (biphenyl structure)
3. The chlorines are distributed on both rings
4. It's a relatively large, planar, aromatic system

Looking at similar structures from the training examples:
- Clc1ccccc1Cl (dichlorobenzene) has -0.33826715
- Molecules with multiple chlorines like ClCC(C)C have negative values
- However, larger aromatic systems with multiple halogens tend to have more positive values
- The most similar example might be Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl which has 1.65707149

Given that our target molecule:
- Is smaller than the last example
- Has fewer chlorines
- But maintains a similar biphenyl core with chlorine substitution

I would predict a value of approximately 0.85

This takes into account that it should be:
- More positive than simple chlorinated benzenes
- Less positive than the larger chlorinated systems
- Similar to other biphenyl-based structures in the dataset

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.4611877148774779
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a para-diethylbenzene (a benzene ring with two ethyl groups in para position).

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have negative values
2. Molecules with simple alkyl substituents on benzene rings typically have values between -0.7 and -0.2
3. The closest analogues in the training set are:
   - CCCCCCc1ccccc1 (heptylbenzene) with -0.19140103
   - Cc1ccccc1N (o-toluidine) with -0.72147311

The target molecule is simpler than heptylbenzene but more substituted than toluidine. It has symmetric ethyl groups which should make it relatively non-polar.

Based on these observations and the general trends in the training data, I predict the property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's an aromatic compound (generally negative values)
- It has simple alkyl substitution
- It's more symmetric and less polar than most of the training examples
- Its complexity falls between the simple and complex aromatics in the training set

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (sulfanilamide) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with sulfonamide groups tend to have moderate values
2. Aromatic amines (NH2 attached to benzene) generally contribute to negative values
3. The size and complexity of this molecule is relatively small/moderate
4. Similar structures like Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O had a value of -0.42364415

Considering these factors:
- The molecule has a primary aromatic amine (NH2) which tends to decrease the value
- The sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is polar and has similar electronic effects to nitro groups
- The overall structure is relatively simple
- The molecule has similar polarity and size to some of the negative-valued examples

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.38

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to the nitroaniline example while considering the slightly different electronic effects of the sulfonamide group compared to a nitro group.

True Property: 0.1930743322475367
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The target molecule (c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34) is pyrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. PAH structures generally have positive values
2. Similar fused ring systems like:
   - c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 (value: 0.67448595)
   - Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32 (value: 0.09695549)
   - c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 (value: 0.57836711)

Pyrene is smaller than the first example but larger than the second example. It's a symmetric, compact structure with four rings, which would likely place its value between these reference compounds.

Based on these observations and the general trends in the dataset, I predict the property value for pyrene to be approximately:

0.45

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's a PAH (generally positive values)
- It's smaller than some of the larger PAHs shown
- It lacks substituents that might significantly alter the property
- Its compact structure is similar to other examples in the dataset

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 1.0201002573835585
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule and comparing it to the training examples, I can make a prediction based on several key observations:

1. The molecule contains multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups, similar to some training examples with hydroxyl groups that tend to have moderate values

2. It has a complex ring system with fused rings and an oxygen bridge, similar to some flavonoid-like structures in the training set

3. The presence of multiple aromatic rings with oxygen-containing substituents is reminiscent of several training examples

4. The overall size and complexity of the molecule is moderate, placing it in the middle range of the training examples

5. The combination of phenolic hydroxyls and ketone group is present in some training examples with values around 0.3-1.3

Based on these structural features and comparing with similar molecules in the training set, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups tend to moderate the extreme values, while the presence of multiple rings and oxygen-containing functional groups typically contributes to a slightly positive value in the training set.

True Property: 0.00952052542337317
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC has several key features:
1. A phosphate group (P=O)
2. Methoxy group (COP)
3. An acetamido group (NC(C)=O)
4. A methylthio group (SC)

Looking at the training examples:
- Molecules containing phosphate groups (P=O) generally have values around 1.0-1.7
- Smaller molecules tend to have lower values
- The presence of S atoms often contributes to slightly higher values
- Acetamido groups (NC(C)=O) tend to contribute to moderate values
- The molecule size is relatively small compared to many of the higher-value examples

Considering these factors:
- The molecule has some similarity to CCN(CC)C(=O)C(=CCOP(=O)(OC)OC)Cl (1.13007675)
- But it's smaller and less complex
- The presence of both P=O and S should give a moderate positive value
- The acetamido group would moderate the value somewhat

Based on these considerations, I predict a property value of approximately:

0.85

This value reflects the molecule's moderate size, the presence of P=O and S atoms, and the moderating effect of the acetamido group, while being proportionally smaller than similar but larger phosphate-containing molecules in the training set.

Comparing with similar structures in the training set:
- Simple halogenated compounds like CCBr have values around -0.70
- The molecule is more complex than CCBr but simpler than many of the larger chlorinated aromatics
- It's smaller than most of the positive-valued chlorinated compounds

Based on these observations and the general trends in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account that it's a small molecule (pushing the value negative) but has two chlorine atoms and a double bond (pushing it slightly higher than very simple halogenated compounds).

Given these similarities and the fact that branched alcohols in this dataset tend to have values in the -0.6 to -0.8 range, I predict the property value for CCCCC(C)O to be approximately:

-0.72

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's a branched alcohol like several examples

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.5166760297187531
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples and molecular patterns.

The molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is 1,4-dibromobenzene, which has:
- A benzene ring as the core structure
- Two bromine atoms in para position

Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
- Halogenated benzenes tend to have values between -0.2 and 0.4
- Di-halogenated compounds generally show slightly higher values than mono-halogenated ones
- Para-substituted patterns tend to be more symmetric and show moderate values
- Comparing to Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl (0.3935439) but considering this is a simpler molecule
- Also considering ClCCl (-0.93518486) but noting this is a much simpler aliphatic molecule

Taking into account these structural features and patterns, and considering that bromine substituents typically lead to slightly higher values than chlorine due to their larger size and polarizability, I would predict the property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 to be approximately:

0.15

This prediction takes into account the symmetry of the molecule, the presence of two bromine atoms, and the aromatic nature of the core structure, while considering the trends observed in the training examples.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 1.7185317724576166
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples and analyzing the given molecule, I notice this is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure similar to some of the examples, particularly the one with SMILES "Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" which has a value of 3.04351964.

The target molecule has 6 chlorine atoms (compared to 10 in the example), but maintains the basic biphenyl structure. Looking at the pattern in the training examples:

1. More complex/larger molecules tend to have higher values
2. Halogenated compounds (especially polyhalogenated) tend to have positive values
3. The more chlorine atoms, the higher the value tends to be
4. Biphenyl-based structures with halogens consistently show high positive values

Given that this molecule is a hexachlorinated biphenyl (6 Cl atoms vs 10 in the reference), but otherwise similar in structure, I would predict the value to be approximately:

2.15

This prediction is lower than the decachlorinated example (3.04351964) because it has fewer chlorine atoms, but still significantly positive due to the biphenyl backbone and multiple chlorine substituents.

1.45

This prediction takes into account:
- The molecule's size and complexity
- The presence of the phosphate group
- The multiple aromatic rings with methyl substituents
- The oxygen linkages
- The overall structural similarity to other molecules in the training set with values in this range

2. Has a benzene ring
3. Contains a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring
4. Has two chlorine atoms
5. Contains a carbonyl group (C=O)

- The presence of N-containing heterocycles typically results in moderate positive values
- The combination of aromatic rings with halogen substituents usually increases the value

Based on these observations and patterns, and considering the overall molecular complexity and similarity to other molecules in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

1.35

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.27928797913697107
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (methoxy-nitrobenzene or nitroanisole) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have values around -0.13 to 0.5
2. Benzene derivatives with oxygen substituents typically have values between -0.8 and 0.5
3. The combination of methoxy (OCH3) and nitro groups on benzene increases the value slightly
4. Similar sized molecules with aromatic rings and polar substituents tend to have values in this range

Considering these factors and comparing to similar structures in the training set, particularly:
- O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-0.13531648)
- c1ccccc1O (-0.84690363)
- And other aromatic compounds with polar substituents

I predict the property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O to be approximately:

0.15

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's less polar than dinitrobenzene
2. The methoxy group typically increases the value compared to phenol

True Property: 2.1887880282181644
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule appears to be a complex polychlorinated structure with multiple chlorine atoms and a cyclic/bridged system. Looking at the patterns in the training examples:

1. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher positive values
   - Example: ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl has value 1.04488247

2. Complex cyclic structures generally increase the value
   - Most polycyclic structures have positive values

3. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms (Cl) in a complex ring system typically leads to higher positive values
   - Similar halogenated complex structures show values > 1.0

4. The molecule in question has:
   - Multiple chlorine substituents (8 Cl atoms)
   - A complex bridged ring system
   - Similar structural complexity to some of the higher-value examples

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately:

1.28 (±0.2)

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has more chlorine atoms than the hexachlorocyclohexane example (1.04488247) but maintains a similar structural complexity, suggesting a somewhat higher value.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.9046710991444203
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCOC=O, propyl formate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice that:
1. Smaller, simpler molecules tend to have negative values
2. Molecules with oxygen-containing groups (especially esters) tend to have slightly negative values
3. The length of the carbon chain influences the value
4. Similar structures like CCOC(=O) show negative values

Analyzing CCCOC=O specifically:
- It's a relatively small molecule
- Contains an ester group
- Has a short carbon chain (3 carbons)
- Similar to other simple esters in the dataset
- No aromatic rings or complex substituents

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.85

This prediction takes into account that:

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.17447564924874528
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (decyl acetate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, I notice:
1. It's a long-chain ester
2. Contains a linear aliphatic chain
3. Has a C(=O)O ester group
4. No aromatic rings or complex functional groups

Analyzing similar patterns in the training set:
- Simple aliphatic compounds tend to have negative values
- Longer chains tend to be less negative than shorter ones
- Esters generally show values in the moderate range
- The complexity and size of the molecule affects the value

Considering these factors:
- The molecule is relatively simple but has a long chain
- Contains an ester group which typically increases the value compared to pure hydrocarbons
- Similar in complexity to molecules like CCCCC(CC)C=O (-0.51895519)
- But larger and contains an ester instead of aldehyde

- The presence of nitro groups tends to increase the value
- Amide linkages generally contribute positively
- Multiple substituted aromatics with polar groups tend to have higher values

Considering molecules with similar structural elements from the training set:
- `CC2Nc1cc(Cl)c(cc1C(=O)N2c3ccccc3C)S(N)(=O)=O` (1.76623057)
- `CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2` (1.0440939)
- `Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl` (1.03250579)

Based on these comparisons and the structural features present, I predict the property value for `Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O` to be approximately:

1.32

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has similar complexity and polarity to the reference compounds, but with some unique combinations of functional groups that would likely result in a value in this range.

1. The molecule contains multiple phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)OC)
2. It has a sulfur bridge connecting two aromatic rings
3. It's a relatively large, symmetric molecule
4. Contains multiple ether linkages
5. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
   - Complex molecules with P=S groups tend to have higher positive values
   - Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and sulfur tend to be positive
   - The presence of multiple ether linkages and phosphorothioate groups is similar to some pesticide-like structures in the training set

Looking at compounds with similar structural features in the training examples:

- Other large molecules with multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms typically have values between 1.0 and 2.0

Based on these observations and the structural complexity of the molecule, I predict the property value would be approximately:

1.65

This prediction takes into account the molecule's size, symmetry, and the presence of phosphorothioate groups, while considering it might be slightly less than some of the most complex molecules in the training set but more than the simpler aromatic structures.

True Property: -0.4141813226861163
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is a nitrophenol, specifically 3-nitrophenol (or m-nitrophenol).

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (o-nitrotoluene) has a value of -0.43314544
2. NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (salicylamide) also has a value of -0.43314544
3. Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (trichlorophenol) has a value of 0.14683728

The target molecule has:
- A phenol group (OH)
- A nitro group (NO2)
- Similar size to the reference molecules
- Similar polarity to the reference molecules

The presence of both OH and NO2 groups makes it somewhat similar to the examples, particularly to the nitrotoluene, but with OH instead of CH3. The hydroxyl group typically contributes to slightly more polarity than a methyl group.

Based on these structural similarities and patterns, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a value close to but slightly more negative than o-nitrotoluene due to the hydroxyl group's presence instead of the methyl group.

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 3.0990656590007952
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, looking at this molecule and the training examples, I can make several observations:

1. This is a complex carbohydrate-like structure with multiple sugar rings connected together
2. It contains many hydroxyl (-OH) groups and oxygen linkages
3. It's a relatively large, polar molecule
4. It has structural similarities to some of the simpler sugar-like molecules in the training set (like C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O which has a value of -0.30820537)

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
- Molecules with many polar groups (especially -OH groups) tend to have lower (more negative) values
- Larger, more lipophilic molecules tend to have higher (more positive) values
- Complex sugar structures tend to have values in the slightly negative to neutral range
- The presence of multiple oxygen atoms and hydroxyl groups typically pushes values lower

Based on these patterns and considering this molecule's structure (which is essentially a trisaccharide with multiple hydroxyl groups), I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.25

This prediction takes into account that while it's a larger molecule (which typically increases the value), its high polarity and multiple hydroxyl groups would tend to decrease the value, landing it in a similar range to other sugar-like molecules in the training set, but slightly higher due to its larger size.

1. Simple, small molecules tend to have negative values
2. Molecules with triple bonds (like N#Cc1ccccc1C#N) tend to have negative values
3. Short-chain aliphatic compounds generally have values between -0.4 and -0.9
4. The presence of unsaturation (like triple bonds) seems to slightly increase the value compared to fully saturated analogs

Given that CCC#C is:
- A small molecule (4 carbons)
- Contains a triple bond
- Has a simple aliphatic chain
- Similar in complexity to molecules like CCCC(=O)C (-0.92363522)

I would predict a value of approximately -0.75

This prediction takes into account that it's simpler than most aromatic compounds in the dataset, has similar size to other negative-valued aliphatics, and the triple bond's effect on the property based on the limited examples containing triple bonds.

My predicted value: -0.75

3. Key considerations:
- The molecule has a relatively small size
- Contains a polar hydrazide group
- Has a pyridine ring
- Overall polarity is significant

4. Comparing with similar structures and considering these factors, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and the target molecule CCCCCCCC (octane), I can make a prediction based on observed patterns:

1. The molecule is a straight-chain alkane with 8 carbons
2. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:

- Complex, multi-ring systems with both halogens and heteroatoms typically have values around 0.8-1.5

Considering these factors and comparing to similar structures in the training set (especially those with chlorinated aromatics and heterocycles), I would predict a value of approximately:

1.12

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of two chlorine atoms (increasing effect)
- The hydroxyl group (slightly decreasing effect)
- The pyrimidine ring (moderating effect)
- The overall molecular size and complexity

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.7697777555952746
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule (CCCCOC=O) and compare it with the training examples to make a prediction.

This molecule is a formate ester with a butyl chain. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. CCCC(=O)OCC (ethyl butyrate): -0.63488441
2. CCCCCC=O (hexanal): -0.78874187
3. Simple esters and aldehydes generally show negative values
4. The molecule has a similar size and functional group pattern to some of the examples

Key observations:
- It's a relatively small molecule
- Contains an ester group (formate)
- Has a medium-length alkyl chain
- Similar polarity to other esters in the dataset
- Simpler than most molecules in the training set

Based on these comparisons and patterns, particularly noting the values for similar small esters and aldehydes, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.71

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The molecule is slightly simpler than ethyl butyrate
2. It has similar polarity to other esters
3. The value should be negative based on similar structures
4. It falls within the general range of similar small molecules in the dataset

Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.9351848639609482
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) by comparing it to the given examples and looking for patterns in molecular structure and corresponding property values.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Small halogenated molecules tend to have negative values
2. ClCCCl has a value of -0.80029152
3. The target molecule ClCCl is similar but smaller
4. Molecules with multiple halogens generally have more negative values
5. Smaller chain lengths tend to have more negative values

ClCCl is structurally very similar to ClCCCl, but with one less carbon. Given that shorter chain lengths tend to make the property more negative, and comparing to similar structures in the training set, I would predict the property value to be:

-0.85 to -0.90

My specific prediction is: -0.87

This takes into account that it should be slightly more negative than ClCCCl (-0.80029152) due to the shorter chain length, while still maintaining a similar range due to the similar chemical nature of the molecule.

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.5771169411186519
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and molecular patterns.

The molecule "Cc1cccc(C)c1O" is a dimethylphenol (specifically, a dimethyl-substituted phenol with a hydroxyl group).

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (-0.30733025) - a methylphenol with similar substitution pattern
- Oc1cccc(O)c1 (-0.69304617) - a disubstituted phenol, but with hydroxyl groups
- c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC (0.11631389) - a more complex phenol derivative

The target molecule has:
- A phenol core structure
- Two methyl substituents
- One hydroxyl group
- Similar size and complexity to some of the reference molecules

Considering these factors and the values of similar structures, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The molecule is relatively small
2. It has similar polarity to other methylated phenols in the dataset
3. It's less polar than dihydroxyphenols
4. The methyl groups would slightly increase the value compared to simple phenol
5. The overall structure suggests a property value in the moderate negative range

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 1.0560378366837055
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and the target molecule, I notice several patterns that can help predict the property value:

1. The target molecule contains multiple chlorine substituents (4 Cl atoms) and two connected aromatic rings, similar to some examples like "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl" (which has a value of 1.71853177)

2. The structure is relatively symmetric and contains biaryl system with chlorine substitutions, which tends to give higher positive values in the given examples

3. Looking at other chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples:
- Simple chlorinated aromatics tend to have values between 0.4 and 2.0
- The more chlorine atoms, generally the higher the value
- Biaryl systems with chlorines tend to be in the 1.3-1.7 range

4. The target molecule is most similar to the example "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl" but has fewer chlorines

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict the property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl to be approximately:

1.45

This value takes into account that it should be:
- Lower than the pentachlorinated biaryl (1.71)
- Higher than simpler chlorinated aromatics
- In line with other complex chlorinated aromatic systems

Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -1.0774926773095088
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is 2-methylbut-2-ene, a relatively simple branched alkene.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Small, simple molecules generally have negative values
2. Alkenes tend to have slightly higher values than their alkane counterparts
3. Molecules with similar size and complexity like:
   - CCCCC(CC)C=O: -0.51895519
   - CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1: -0.46118771
   - CCCCCCCCC=C: -0.40302596
   - COC(=O)C=C: -0.92405835

Given that CC=C(C)C is:
- A small molecule
- Contains a double bond
- Has branching
- No functional groups besides the alkene
- Similar in size to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.65

This takes into account that it's a simple molecule (suggesting negative value) but has some structural features (branching and double bond) that would make it slightly less negative than the simplest molecules in the dataset.
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.9351848639609482
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ClCCl, or dichloromethane) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice several patterns:
1. Smaller, simpler molecules tend to have negative values
2. Highly chlorinated compounds tend to have more positive values
3. Molecules with similar structural features show similar values
4. The presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the value compared to non-chlorinated analogs

For ClCCl specifically:
- It's a very small molecule
- It has two chlorine atoms
- It's symmetric
- It has no other functional groups
- It's similar in size to some of the smaller molecules in the training set
- Looking at similar chlorinated compounds in the training set, but considering this is much smaller

Comparing to similar structures in the training set like "ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl" which has a value of -0.15718484, but considering this molecule is simpler and smaller, I would predict:

Predicted value for ClCCl: -0.35

This prediction takes into account that it should be negative (like many small molecules in the set) but not as negative as non-chlorinated small molecules due to the presence of the two chlorine atoms.

Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.14683727544392286
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms at positions 2,4,6 and a hydroxyl group.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (2,4,6-trichlorophenol) has a value of 0.14683728
2. Other halogenated aromatics like Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 has a value of 1.27539459

The target molecule is exactly the same as the first reference compound (just written in a slightly different SMILES notation), so it should have the same property value.

Therefore, I predict the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl to be:

0.14683728

This prediction is made with high confidence since we have an exact structural match in the training set.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 3.9080602859864895
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples. Let me break down my analysis:

1. The molecule is relatively large and complex, containing:
- Multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters)
- Aromatic rings
- A complex fused ring system
- Multiple stereogenic centers
- Several oxygen bridges
- A methylenedioxy group (OCO)

2. Looking at patterns in the training examples:
- Larger, more complex molecules tend to have higher positive values
- Molecules with multiple oxygen-containing groups and rings tend to have values > 0.5
- Natural product-like structures with multiple rings and oxygenated functionalities typically show values between 1.0 and 2.0
- The presence of aromatic rings with oxygen substituents generally contributes to higher values

3. This molecule shares structural similarities with several of the larger examples that had values between 1.0 and 2.0, particularly those with complex ring systems and multiple oxygen-containing groups.

Based on these considerations and the structural complexity of the molecule, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's size, complexity, and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, while staying within the range of values observed in the training set for similarly complex molecules.

Iteration: 97
SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.30884007471881475
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1) The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A thioether group (CS-)
- A triazine ring with =O and -NH2 substituents
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

2) Looking at similar structural patterns in the training examples:
- Molecules containing heterocyclic rings with nitrogen typically have values around 0.2 to 0.7
- The presence of sulfur tends to slightly increase the value
- Molecules with tert-butyl groups often show moderate positive values
- The combination of polar groups (-NH2, C=O) with hydrophobic groups (t-butyl) tends to result in moderate positive values

3) Most similar examples from the training set:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C (0.71309697) - contains nnc, sulfur, and t-butyl
- CCNc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(OC)n1 (0.27974958) - similar nitrogen-containing heterocycle

Based on these considerations and the structural patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C to be approximately:

0.45

This prediction takes into account the moderate positive contribution of the t-butyl group, the slight positive effect of the sulfur, and the balancing effect of the polar groups in the heterocyclic ring system.

Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.30775338848362166
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (ethyl benzoate) and predict its property value by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's an aromatic ester with a single benzene ring
2. Has similar structural elements to some training examples, particularly other esters and aromatic compounds
3. The size and complexity is moderate
4. Contains common functional groups (ester, aromatic ring)

Looking at similar compounds in the training set:
- Simple esters like CCCCCC(=O)OC have values around -0.5
- Benzene-containing compounds tend to have values between -0.6 and -0.1
- The combination of aromatic ring and ester group appears in some examples

Based on these patterns and the molecule's structural features, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's more complex than simple esters (which would increase the value slightly from -0.5)
2. The aromatic nature typically contributes to a moderate negative value
3. The ester group tends to contribute to negative values in the training set
4. The overall size and polarity is moderate

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.029600179043578156
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (1-bromoheptane, CCCCCCCBr) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple linear molecules tend to have negative values
2. Longer alkyl chains tend to be less negative than shorter ones
3. Halogenated compounds generally have higher values than their non-halogenated counterparts
4. The presence of bromine typically increases the value compared to hydrogen

Analyzing similar molecules from the examples:
- CCCCCCC=C (heptene) has a value of -0.67281265
- CCCCCCCO (heptanol) has a value of -0.63446128
- CI (methyl iodide) has a value of -0.3869757
- Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (bromonaphthalene) has a value of 0.23936909

Given that:
1. The base structure is similar to heptene/heptanol (around -0.65)
2. Replacing terminal H with Br should increase the value
3. The bromine effect should be similar but slightly less than seen in aromatic systems

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately:

-0.35

This takes into account both the negative contribution from the alkyl chain and the positive contribution from the bromine, while maintaining consistency with the patterns seen in the training set.

SMILES: CO
True Property: -1.4438213388777419
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

CO (methanol) is one of the simplest organic molecules containing a single carbon with a hydroxyl group. Looking at the training examples, I observe that:

1. Smaller molecules generally have more negative values
2. Simple alcohols tend to have negative values (e.g., CCC(C)CO at -0.90424796)
3. The presence of oxygen typically makes the value less negative compared to pure hydrocarbons
4. Very simple molecules like CCC have very negative values (-1.32789211)
5. The simplest molecules in the set (like CC#C at -1.36666662) have the most negative values

Given that CO (methanol) is:
- A very small molecule
- Contains one oxygen (alcohol)
- Simpler than ethanol or propanol
- But not as simple as pure hydrocarbons

I would predict a value of approximately -1.15

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- More negative than larger alcohols
- Less negative than pure small hydrocarbons
- In the general range of other simple molecules in the dataset

The predicted property value for CO (methanol) is: -1.15
