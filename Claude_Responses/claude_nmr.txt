Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the given examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester of a long-chain fatty acid (methyl decanoate).

Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
1. CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl laurate) has a value of 0.59608356
2. Long chain hydrocarbons generally have values between -0.7 to 0.6
3. Esters (COC(=O)) typically contribute to a slight increase in the property
4. The length of the carbon chain appears to have a positive correlation with the property value

Given that this molecule:
- Is slightly shorter than methyl laurate (10 vs 12 carbons)

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 0.2394540331447885
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the target molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (which is fluorene, a bicyclic aromatic compound), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1. The molecule contains two benzene rings fused with a five-membered ring
2. It's similar in structure to other polycyclic aromatic compounds in the training set
3. Looking at similar structures:
   - c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 (anthracene) has a value of 1.18295213
   - Other fused ring systems tend to have values between 0.5 and 1.5
4. The molecule is smaller than anthracene but has a similar aromatic character
5. It has no polar functional groups, similar to simple aromatic systems

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.65

This prediction takes into account that:
- It should be lower than anthracene due to smaller size
- Higher than simple benzene derivatives
- Similar to other fused ring systems without polar substituents
- The molecule's relatively compact and symmetric structure

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -1.0197482553845363
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, a relatively simple ester.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Small molecules generally have negative values
2. Molecules with C=O (carbonyl) groups often have more negative values
3. Simple esters tend to have values around -0.6 to -0.7
4. The molecule is similar in size and functionality to CC(C)CCOC=O which has a value of -0.66273007

Considering these factors:
- It's a small molecule (suggesting negative value)
- Contains an ester group (C=O and O)
- Similar to other simple esters in the training set
- Slightly smaller than CC(C)CCOC=O but with similar functional groups

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict the property value would be approximately:

Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.4252698342947853
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethyl phenol:
- It has a benzene ring as the core structure
- Contains two methyl (C) substituents
- Has one hydroxyl (O) group

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple phenol (c1ccccc1O) has a value of -0.79348128
- Methylated aromatics tend to increase the value slightly compared to unsubstituted variants
- The presence of hydroxyl groups generally decreases the value
- The molecule size is relatively small, suggesting a lower value

Considering these factors:
1. It's larger than phenol but smaller than most high-value compounds
2. The two methyl groups will increase the value compared to simple phenol
3. The hydroxyl group contributes to a negative shift
4. The overall complexity is moderate

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.45

This value reflects that it should be:
- Higher than simple phenol (-0.79)
- Lower than most complex aromatic compounds (>0.5)
- In the range of other small-to-medium sized aromatic compounds with polar substituents

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.9082121361332782
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has several key features:
1. It's an organophosphate compound with P=S group
2. Contains methoxy groups (OC) attached to phosphorus
3. Has an aromatic ring with methylthio (SC) and methyl (C) substituents
4. Overall structure is similar to other organophosphate compounds in the training set

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a value of 0.85038032
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has a value of 1.14991648
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has a value of 0.95492843

The target molecule has similar backbone but with less electronegative substituents (SC and C instead of Cl, Br, or I). This would likely result in a slightly lower value than these reference compounds.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.82

This prediction takes into account that the methylthio and methyl substituents would make the molecule slightly less polar than the chlorinated analogs while maintaining similar overall structural characteristics.

Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 1.1039774970185579
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided.

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 5 chlorine atoms. Looking at the training examples:

1. Similar structures with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have positive values:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl) → 1.29869349
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (7 Cl) → 1.49340948

2. The target molecule has:
- Biphenyl core structure
- 5 chlorine substituents
- Similar molecular size to the reference PCBs
- Slightly less chlorination than the examples

Based on these observations:
- It should have a positive value
- The value should be slightly lower than the 6-Cl example (1.29869349)
- But higher than simpler chlorinated aromatics

Taking all these factors into account, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.15

This prediction considers that the molecule has fewer chlorines than the reference PCBs but maintains similar structural features that contribute to the positive property value.
==================================================
Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -1.024901816403672
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O, propyl nitrite) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. It has a short carbon chain (3 carbons)
3. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - Simple alkanes (CCC) tend to have very negative values (around -1.2)
   - Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to increase the value
   - Small molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups often have values in the -0.7 to -0.4 range
   - The closest analogues in the training set might be O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (-0.0823054)

Considering these factors:
- The base propyl chain would contribute a negative value
- The nitro group would increase the value somewhat
- The small size of the molecule would keep it in the negative range

Based on these considerations, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.65

This takes into account both the negative contribution of the small alkyl chain and the positive contribution of the nitro group, while staying consistent with the general trends observed in the training data.

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.560552754320492
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobromobenzene with the substituents in meta position to each other.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of -0.36420441 (para-substituted halobenzene)
- COc1cccc(Cl)c1 has a value of -0.40882197 (meta-substituted)
- Cc1ccccc1C has a value of -0.48997306 (disubstituted benzene)

The target molecule has:
1. A benzene ring core (similar to many examples)
2. Two halogen substituents (F and Br)
3. Meta substitution pattern

Considering that:
- Fluorine is typically less impactful on this property than chlorine
- The meta-substitution pattern is similar to some training examples
- Bromine's effect appears to be moderate based on other examples
- The overall molecular size and substitution pattern suggests a value in the negative range

I predict the property value would be approximately: -0.38

This prediction takes into account that the molecule's structure and substitution pattern falls between the similar examples shown in the training set.

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.1277546789291262
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic structure with:
- A bridged bicyclic system
- One hydroxyl group (-OH)
- Multiple methyl substituents
- Saturated carbons

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Molecules with bicyclic systems tend to have values around 0.5 to 2.0
2. The presence of hydroxyl groups tends to decrease the value somewhat
3. This molecule is simpler than the complex steroids in the training set (which have values >1.5)
4. It's more complex than simple alcohols (which have values < -0.5)

Considering these factors:
- The basic bicyclic structure would contribute positively
- The hydroxyl group would decrease the value somewhat
- The molecule is relatively compact and not highly functionalized
- It's more complex than simple molecules but simpler than the steroids

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.42

This value reflects that it's a moderately complex molecule with a polar group, placing it in the middle range of the observed values, but closer to the lower end of the bicyclic compounds due to its relative simplicity compared to the more complex examples in the training set.

Iteration: 33
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 1.0087959665821773
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value by comparing it to the training examples and considering key structural features:

The target molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has:
1. A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
2. A phthalimide ring system
3. Ethoxy groups attached to phosphorus
4. Similar overall size and complexity to some training examples

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O (1.86768394) is very similar, just missing the CCl-S- linker
- Other molecules containing phthalimide-like structures show moderate positive values
- Phosphorothioate containing compounds tend to have positive values
- The presence of O=C-N linkages generally contributes to positive values

Considering these factors and the structural similarity to the closest matching compound (but with slightly lower molecular weight and complexity), I would predict a property value of approximately:

1.65

This value is slightly lower than the most similar training example (1.86768394) due to the reduced molecular weight and absence of the chlorinated portion, while still maintaining the core structural features that contribute to a positive value.

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 0.28076802532685197
Predicted Property:

1) The target molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a pyrazolone derivative with:
- A phenyl substituent
- Two methyl groups
- A cyclic structure with a carbonyl group
- Contains nitrogen atoms in a heterocyclic ring

2) Looking at similar structures in the training examples:

- The size and complexity is moderate

Based on these considerations and the structural similarities to known examples, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.65

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is less complex than some of the higher-value examples but contains similar structural features to molecules with moderate positive values in the training set.

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.3011257573164722
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCC(=O)OCC - ethyl hexanoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Longer chain aliphatic compounds tend to have values closer to 0
2. Esters generally have values in the -0.8 to 0.1 range
3. Simple alkyl chains like CCCCC have values around -0.9
4. The presence of C=O and O groups tends to slightly increase the value compared to pure alkanes
5. Similar compounds like CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC have a value of 0.05775797

For CCCCCC(=O)OCC:
- It's a medium-length ester
- Has similar structural features to CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC but is slightly shorter
- Contains both ester functionality and aliphatic chain
- More complex than simple alkanes but simpler than cyclic/aromatic compounds

Based on these observations and the structural similarities to known compounds, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.15

This value takes into account that it should be:
- Higher than simple alkanes (-0.9)
- Lower than longer chain esters (0.05)
- In the typical range for medium-sized aliphatic esters

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.4174695349241921
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples and molecular structure patterns.

The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is methyl benzoate, which consists of:
- A benzene ring (c1ccccc1)
- A carboxylate ester group (-C(=O)OC)

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) has a value of -0.23802767
- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 (with an additional OH group) has a value of -0.17332444

The target molecule is very similar to ethyl benzoate, just with a methyl ester instead of an ethyl ester. This small difference (one less CH2 group) would likely make it slightly more polar and therefore should have a slightly more negative value.

Based on these structural similarities and patterns, I predict the property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 to be approximately:

-0.26

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's slightly smaller than ethyl benzoate
2. It maintains the same core functional groups
3. It has similar polarity distribution
4. The property values for similar molecules tend to fall in this range

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.9138009903908348
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (1,3-pentadiene) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice several patterns:
1. Simple, small hydrocarbons tend to have negative values
2. Molecules with conjugated double bonds tend to have slightly higher values than their saturated counterparts
3. The molecule C=CCC=C is similar in size and structure to CC/C=C/C (pent-2-ene) which has a value of -0.91014764
4. However, our target molecule has two double bonds (conjugated system) which should increase the value slightly

Considering these factors:
- The molecule is a small hydrocarbon (suggesting negative value)
- It has conjugated double bonds (slightly increasing the value)
- It's similar in size to pent-2-ene but with an additional double bond
- It lacks any functional groups or heavy atoms

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for C=CCC=C to be approximately:

-0.85

This value is slightly higher than the similar pent-2-ene (-0.91014764) due to the conjugation, but still maintains a negative value due to its small size and hydrocarbon nature.

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: -0.6977867208255398
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (tribromomethane or bromoform) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Halogenated compounds tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. Small molecules with multiple halogens often have slightly negative values
3. The complexity and size of the molecule affects the value
4. Similar halogenated compounds like FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br have a value of -0.92888079

For BrC(Br)Br (tribromomethane):
- It's a small molecule
- Contains three bromine atoms
- Similar in structure to other trihalomethanes
- More polarizable than chloroform due to bromine atoms
- Relatively symmetric structure

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for BrC(Br)Br to be approximately:

1. The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
- Two ethoxy groups (OCC)
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl)
- A phthalimide ring system
- Several aliphatic carbons

2. Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
- Molecules with P=S groups tend to have higher values (like the example with COP(=S))
- Presence of chlorine typically contributes moderately
- Complex ring systems with carbonyls generally increase the value
- The size and complexity of this molecule is similar to some examples with values around 1.5-2.0

3. Comparing specifically to:
COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, 1.79994143
This is the most similar structure in the training set, though our target molecule has a phthalimide instead of an anilide.

Based on these considerations and the structural similarities to known examples, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.85

This prediction takes into account the similar phosphorothioate backbone, the presence of chlorine, and the cyclic imide system, while considering the overall molecular complexity and size.

1. The molecule contains several key structural features:
- A urea linkage (N-C(=O)-N)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring
- A heterocyclic ring system with N-N and O
- A tert-butyl group
- N,N-dimethyl substitution

2. Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Molecules with urea-like structures tend to have values around 0.5-1.0
- Chlorinated aromatics typically increase the value
- Complex heterocycles generally contribute positively
- Bulky groups like tert-butyl tend to increase the value
- The overall size and complexity is similar to some of the higher-value compounds

3. Considering the molecular size and complexity, it's likely to have a moderately positive value.

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.15

This prediction takes into account the molecule's relatively complex structure, presence of multiple functional groups, and similarity to other molecules in the training set with moderate to high values.

True Property: 0.8212234462914207
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has:
- A diphenyl ether core structure
- Three chlorine substituents
- One hydroxyl group
- Similar structural elements to some training examples, particularly chlorinated aromatic compounds

Looking at relevant examples from the training set:
- Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl (-0.40404929) - similar but smaller
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (-0.0146173) - more chlorinated
- c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2 (0.32511352) - biphenyl structure
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 (0.51982952) - dichlorinated biphenyl

The target molecule is larger than the simple chlorophenols but smaller than some of the more complex structures. It has features that tend to increase the property value (multiple halogens, larger conjugated system) balanced by the hydroxyl group which tends to decrease it.

Based on these structural considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.15 ± 0.10

This value reflects that it should be higher than simple chlorophenols but lower than the larger chlorinated aromatics in the training set.

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.9101476364255348
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this problem as a chemist:

1) The target molecule CC/C=C\C is a pentene (C5H10) with a trans (E) configuration at the double bond, while one of the example molecules CC/C=C/C is the same compound but with a cis (Z) configuration.

2) Looking at the examples, I notice:
- Smaller, simpler molecules tend to have negative values
- The presence of double bonds in simple chains tends to give values around -0.9 to -1.0
- The exact same molecule with just a different stereochemistry (CC/C=C/C) has a value of -0.91014764

3) Given that:
- This is the same molecular formula and connectivity as the example
- Only the stereochemistry is different
- Stereochemistry typically has a small but noticeable effect on physical properties
- Trans isomers are usually slightly more stable than cis isomers

4) Therefore, I would predict the value to be very close to but slightly less negative than the cis isomer.

My prediction for CC/C=C\C would be approximately -0.89

This takes into account that it's the trans isomer which typically has slightly different properties than the cis form, but the difference should be relatively small given the molecular size and structure.

True Property: -0.8448925161304414
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCOCC - ethyl propyl ether) by comparing it with the training examples and looking for patterns in molecular structure and corresponding property values.

Key observations:
1. The molecule is relatively small and simple
2. Contains an ether group (-O-)
3. Has only C, H, and O atoms
4. Linear structure
5. Similar in size/complexity to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- Simple alkanes tend to have very negative values (e.g., C = -1.62)
- Molecules with oxygen tend to be less negative than pure hydrocarbons
- Molecules of similar size and with oxygen functionality have values around -0.6 to -0.8
- The presence of an ether group typically raises the value slightly compared to alcohols of similar size

Based on these patterns and considering:
- The molecule's size
- The presence of the ether group
- The linear nature of the carbon chains
- Comparison with similar structures in the training set

I predict the property value for CCCOCC to be approximately: -0.73

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is larger than methanol but smaller than many of the complex structures in the dataset, and considers the moderating effect of the ether oxygen on the property value.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.003000414107672698
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is acetanilide with a bromine substituent (4-bromoacetanilide).

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Molecules with bromine substituents tend to have values around -0.5 to 0
2. Aromatic compounds with polar substituents (like -NH, -OH) generally have values in similar ranges
3. The closest structural analogs in the training set include:
   - Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.49421717)
   - Fc1cccc(Br)c1 (-0.56055275)
   - Cc1ccc(N)cc1 (-0.5025888)

The target molecule has:
- An aromatic ring
- A bromine substituent
- An acetamide group (-NHC(=O)CH3)

Considering these structural features and the values of similar compounds, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.42

This prediction takes into account that the acetamide group would make the molecule slightly more polar than the bromophenol example, but the overall structure should maintain a similar property range to other substituted aromatics in the training set.

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.137541003700004
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is ethylbenzene with an additional methyl group (isopropyl group attached to benzene).

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethyltoluene) has a value of -0.30959843
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (p-isopropyltoluene) has a value of -0.12650321
- Cc1cccc2ccccc12 (methylnaphthalene) has a value of 0.00630009
- Simple benzene derivatives generally have values between -0.6 and -0.1

The target molecule is most similar to these structures, particularly to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1, but with one less methyl group. It should have a value slightly lower than p-isopropyltoluene (-0.12650321) but higher than ethyltoluene (-0.30959843).

Based on these structural relationships and trends, I predict the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 to be approximately:

-0.22

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's a benzene derivative with an aliphatic substituent
2. The branching in the side chain tends to increase the value
3. It's less substituted than some of the reference molecules
4. The size and complexity of the molecule puts it in the middle range of similar structures
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6487967987695751
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice that:
1. Simpler aromatic structures tend to have lower values
2. The presence of oxygen generally leads to more negative values
3. Single-ring aromatics with simple substituents typically have values between -0.6 and -0.3
4. The aldehyde group (C=O) tends to make molecules slightly more negative in property value

Benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) has:
- A single benzene ring
- A simple aldehyde substituent
- Similar structural complexity to molecules like COc1ccccc1 (-0.60353796)
- More polar than simple aromatics but less than alcohols

Comparing it specifically to similar structures in the training set:
- COc1ccccc1 (-0.60353796)
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (-0.46242911)
- Simple aromatic compounds with oxygen-containing substituents

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) to be approximately:

-0.52

This value takes into account the molecule's aromaticity, the presence of the aldehyde group, and its overall structural similarity to other molecules in the training set.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.1818204310687935
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains a furan ring (5-membered oxygen heterocycle) with a nitro group
2. It has a cyclic urea structure (hydantoin-like)
3. There's a hydrazone linkage connecting these parts
4. The molecule contains multiple polar groups (C=O, NO2)
5. Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
   - Molecules with nitro groups tend to have higher values
   - Heterocyclic compounds with multiple heteroatoms often have values around 0 to 1
   - The presence of both aromatic and polar groups typically leads to moderate positive values

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.45

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has some structural features that would increase the value (nitro group, multiple heteroatoms) but is not as large or lipophilic as some of the highest-value compounds in the training set. The presence of the polar groups and moderate size suggests a middle-range positive value.

Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.4510920510452662
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is a hydrazine derivative with two phenyl rings. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 has a value of 0.33179838 - This is very similar but has a double bond instead of single bond
2. Other diphenyl-containing structures like c1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ccccc3 have values around 1.1
3. The presence of nitrogen atoms generally seems to lower the value compared to pure hydrocarbon analogs
4. The molecule has similar size/complexity to several examples with values between 0.3-0.5

Considering these factors:
- The structure is very similar to the azobenzene example but with a single N-N bond
- The reduction of the double bond to single bond would likely reduce the value slightly
- The overall molecular size and aromatic character is maintained

Based on these considerations, I would predict a value of approximately 0.31 for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2.

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to azobenzene while accounting for the slightly different electronic nature of the N-N single bond versus N=N double bond.

1. It's a cyclic imide structure
2. Contains a cyclopentane ring fused to the imide
3. Has multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)
4. Relatively compact and symmetric structure
5. Contains no aromatic rings or halogens

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1 has a value of -0.00705408
- O=C1CCCN1 has a value of -1.0213534
- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC has a value of 0.3868863

The target molecule is most similar to these examples, particularly the last one, but is somewhat smaller and more compact. It has a similar number of carbonyls and nitrogen atoms, but lacks the longer alkyl chains.

Based on these comparisons and the general trends in the dataset (where larger, more complex molecules tend to have higher values, and simpler, more polar molecules tend to have lower values), I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.15

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is more complex than the simple lactam (O=C1CCCN1) but less complex than the substituted uracil derivative (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC).

- Simple chlorinated aromatics tend to have values between -0.5 and 0.5
- Larger molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have higher values
- Multiple halogens increase the value somewhat

Given that this molecule:
- Is larger than dichlorobenzene but smaller than the complex chlorinated structure
- Has three chlorines on a biphenyl system
- Has a similar structural complexity to some mid-range examples

I would predict a property value of approximately 0.65

This takes into account the size, number of halogens, and overall structural complexity while staying within the range established by the training examples.

True Property: -0.12922379360878902
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a para-diethylbenzene (a benzene ring with two ethyl groups in para position).

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Aromatic compounds generally have values between -0.5 and 0.5
2. Simple alkylbenzenes like toluene derivatives show moderate values
3. The longer the alkyl chains on benzene, the slightly higher the value
4. Symmetrical substitutions tend to give more moderate values

Comparing specifically with similar structures:
- CCCCCCc1ccccc1 (heptylbenzene) has value 0.22406331
- Cc1ccccc1N (o-toluidine) has value -0.5025888

The target molecule is simpler than heptylbenzene but more substituted than toluidine, and has symmetrical substitution.

0.15

This value reflects that it's:
- More substituted than simple aromatics
- Has symmetrical substitution
- Contains moderate-length alkyl chains
- Falls within the typical range for alkylbenzenes

3. The size and complexity of the molecule affects the value
4. Similar molecules like "Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O" has a value of -0.42806815

The target molecule has:
- A primary aromatic amine (NH2)
- A sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O)
- Para substitution pattern
- Similar size to some of the negative-valued examples

Considering these factors and comparing to similar structures in the training set, particularly the para-nitroaniline example (-0.42806815), I would predict a value of approximately:

- c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 (1.36705785)
- Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32 (0.68667897)

Pyrene is simpler than the first two examples but more complex than the last one. Based on the structural patterns and values in the training set, I would predict the property value for pyrene to be:

0.95 (±0.1)

This prediction takes into account that pyrene has:
- A fully conjugated system
- Four fused rings (more than phenanthrene but less than the larger PAHs in the training set)

Given these similarities and the fact that branched alcohols in this size range tend to have values between -0.4 and -0.7 in the training set, I predict the property value for CCCCC(C)O to be approximately:

-0.65

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's a branched alcohol like CCC(C)CCO (-0.67490273)
2. It has similar molecular weight and polarity
3. The branching position is different but should have minimal impact on this property
4. The overall structural features align well with other medium-sized alcohols in the training set

True Property: -0.259656303263545
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is 1,4-dibromobenzene, which has:
- A benzene ring as the core structure
- Two bromine atoms in para position

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Chlorinated benzenes tend to have values around -0.2 to 0.5
- Di-substituted benzenes with halogens show values around 0.5
- The closest analogs might be:
  * Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl (0.51982952)
  * Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1 (-0.40404929)
  * Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 (-0.40404929)

Considering that:
1. Bromine is slightly more lipophilic than chlorine
2. The symmetrical para substitution pattern is similar to some examples
3. The molecule is simpler than many of the training examples
4. The size and electronic effects of bromine vs chlorine

I would predict a property value of approximately 0.45

This takes into account that the molecule should have a value:
- Higher than mono-substituted aromatics
- Similar to but slightly different from dichlorinated benzenes
- Lower than more complex polycyclic structures

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 1.2986934902755072
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the target molecule, I can make several observations:

1. The target molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure, similar to some of the examples given
2. It contains multiple chlorine substituents (6 Cl atoms) on a biphenyl core
3. The structure is relatively large and hydrophobic
4. It's similar in nature to "Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" which has a value of 2.07755746

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
- Larger, more hydrophobic molecules tend to have higher positive values
- Chlorinated aromatics generally have positive values
- Multiple chlorine substitutions increase the value
- Biphenyl-based structures tend to have values > 1

Given these observations and the similarity to the decachlorobiphenyl example (though with fewer chlorines), I would predict a value of approximately:

1.85

This value is slightly lower than the decachlorobiphenyl example (2.07755746) because it has fewer chlorine atoms, but still significantly positive due to its size and number of chlorine substituents.

Analyzing similar structures from the examples:
- O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (dinitrobenzene) has -0.34093177
- Simple aromatic ethers tend to have slightly negative values
- The ortho substitution pattern will affect the overall property

Considering all these factors and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O to be approximately:

1. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have values around 0 to 0.4
2. Complex ring systems generally increase the value
3. The most similar example in the training set is "ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl" with value 0.36234664

The target molecule has:
- More complex ring system than the similar example
- More chlorine atoms
- More constrained/rigid structure

Given these factors and comparing with the training examples, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.52

This prediction is based on:
- The base value of similar chlorinated rings (~0.36)
- Additional complexity of the ring system (adding ~0.1)
- Additional chlorine atoms (adding ~0.06)

This is my best estimate based on the structural patterns observed in the training set.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -1.0188932150947851
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCOC=O, propyl formate) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a formate ester group
2. Similar in size to some of the smaller molecules in the training set
3. Contains an oxygen-containing functional group (ester)
4. Has a short alkyl chain (propyl)

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- Simple esters and small oxygenated compounds tend to have negative values
- Short-chain compounds generally have values between -1.0 and -0.5
- The presence of oxygen typically pushes the value more negative
- Compounds with similar molecular weight and polarity show values in this range

1. It's a long-chain ester with 12 carbons total
2. Contains a single ester group (C(=O)O)
3. Has a long linear alkyl chain
4. No aromatic rings, halogens, or other functional groups

Looking at the training examples:
- Longer carbon chains tend to increase the value
- Simple esters generally have moderate positive values
- Linear molecules without aromatic rings tend to have values between -0.5 and 0.5
- The presence of C(=O)O group typically contributes to a slight positive shift

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- CCCCC(CC)C=O has -0.35573174
- CCCC=C(CC)C=O has -0.35666451
- But these are aldehydes, not esters

The molecule in question is more hydrophobic than these examples due to its longer chain, but the ester group adds polarity.

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.15

This takes into account the moderate positive contribution of the ester group balanced with the long alkyl chain's influence.

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, looking at this molecule and the training examples, I can make several observations:

1. This appears to be a complex carbohydrate/oligosaccharide structure with multiple sugar rings connected through glycosidic bonds.

2. The molecule contains many polar hydroxyl (-OH) groups and oxygen atoms, making it highly hydrophilic.

3. Looking at the training examples:
   - Highly hydrophilic molecules with multiple -OH groups tend to have negative values
   - Complex, large molecules tend to have more positive values
   - Simple sugars and highly polar compounds generally show negative values
   - The presence of multiple -OH groups and oxygen atoms typically pushes values lower

4. The closest structural analogs in the training set might be C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O (simple sugar) which has a value of -0.72070957

5. However, this molecule is significantly larger and more complex than that simple sugar, which would tend to increase the value somewhat, but the high number of polar groups would still keep it in the negative range.

Based on these considerations, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.85

This takes into account both the size/complexity of the molecule (which would increase the value) and the high number of polar groups (which would decrease it), placing it in a similar range to other highly polar, oxygen-rich molecules in the training set.

- Complex multi-ring systems generally lead to higher values
- Nitrogen-containing heterocycles tend to slightly decrease the value
- The overall size and complexity is similar to some compounds that have values around 1.0-1.4

Considering these factors:
- The chlorinated aromatics will contribute positively
- The OH group will decrease it slightly
- The pyrimidine ring will decrease it slightly
- The overall complexity and size will contribute positively

Based on these considerations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.08

This prediction takes into account the balance between the lipophilic chlorinated aromatics and the more polar OH and pyrimidine groups, while considering the overall molecular complexity.

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.8394513506502074
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule (CCCCOC=O) and compare it with the training examples to make a prediction.

This molecule is a formate ester with a butyl chain. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. CCCC(=O)OCC (ethyl butyrate): -0.66000949
2. CCCCCC=O (hexanal): -0.71189489
3. Simple esters and similar small molecules generally have negative values
4. The molecule has a similar size and functional groups to these examples

Key observations:
- It's a relatively small molecule
- Contains an ester group
- Has a straight chain of 4 carbons
- Similar polarity to the reference compounds
- Structurally most similar to ethyl butyrate, but slightly simpler

Based on these comparisons and patterns, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.70

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The molecule is slightly simpler than ethyl butyrate
2. It has similar polarity to hexanal
3. The presence of the ester group typically contributes to negative values in this property scale
4. The chain length is similar to other molecules with values in this range

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -1.241747806978088
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ClCCl) and predict its property value based on the given examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Small, halogenated molecules tend to have negative values
2. ClCCCl appears in the training set with a value of -1.05258958
3. ClCCl is similar but with one less carbon
4. Other small halogenated molecules like CCBr have values around -1.12
5. The molecule is symmetric and very small

Given that:
- ClCCl is smaller than ClCCCl (-1.05258958)
- It's a simple halogenated molecule
- It has similar structural features to other negative-valued molecules
- It's slightly more polar than ClCCCl due to closer proximity of the chlorines

I would predict a value of approximately -1.15 for ClCCl.

This prediction takes into account that smaller halogenated molecules tend to have more negative values in the training set, and the molecule's structural similarity to other examples.

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.4252698342947853
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and molecular patterns.

The molecule "Cc1cccc(C)c1O" is a dimethylphenol (specifically, a dimethyl-substituted phenol with two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a benzene ring).

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
1. CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (-0.06179998) - Very similar structure with methyl groups and hydroxyl
2. Oc1cccc(O)c1 (-0.72877804) - Similar core but with two hydroxyls
3. Cc1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (0.10180032) - Similar core but with different substituents

The target molecule is most similar to the first example, but with a slightly simpler structure. It has:
- One hydroxyl group (OH)
- Two methyl groups (CH3)
- A benzene ring core

Given these structural similarities and considering the property values of similar molecules, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.08

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The structure is very similar to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (-0.06179998)
2. It's slightly simpler, which might reduce the value slightly
3. The positioning of the methyl groups is different but should have similar electronic effects

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.9092615037616085
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 4 chlorine atoms. Looking at similar structures in the training examples:

1. Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (5 Cl atoms) has value 1.1039775
2. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl atoms) has value 1.29869349

The target molecule has:
- Biphenyl core structure (like the reference molecules)
- 4 chlorine substituents (fewer than the references)
- Similar substitution pattern
- Slightly less chlorination than the reference molecules

Given that:
- The property values seem to increase with more chlorination
- The target molecule has fewer chlorines than both reference molecules
- The values for similar structures range from ~1.10 to ~1.30
- The target structure should have a value slightly lower than 1.1039775

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.05

This takes into account the structural similarity to the reference molecules while accounting for the reduced chlorination.

1. This is a small, simple hydrocarbon
2. It contains a double bond
3. It's relatively non-polar

- Branching seems to make values slightly less negative
- The molecule is similar in complexity to molecules like CCCCC(CC)C=O (-0.35573174) but simpler

Based on these patterns and considering the molecule's characteristics, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.65

This prediction takes into account that it's a small hydrocarbon (pushing towards negative values) but has both branching and unsaturation (making it less negative than fully saturated linear hydrocarbons).
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -1.241747806978088
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) and predict its property based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice several patterns:
1. Smaller, simpler molecules generally have negative values
2. Highly halogenated (especially chlorinated) small molecules tend to have values around -0.7 to -0.4
3. The presence of chlorine atoms tends to make the value less negative compared to pure hydrocarbons
4. Simple molecules with similar structure:
   - ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a value of -0.7028781
   - Small chlorinated compounds generally have negative values

For ClCCl (dichloromethane):
- It's a very small molecule
- Has two chlorine atoms
- Simple aliphatic structure
- No other functional groups
- Similar to other small halogenated compounds in the dataset

Based on these observations and the molecule's characteristics, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.65

This prediction takes into account that it's a small molecule (which tends to give negative values) and has chlorine atoms (which make it less negative than pure hydrocarbons), while being simpler than ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl which has a value of -0.7028781.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.20933329566492248
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples provided.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms at positions 2,4,6 and a hydroxyl group.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (2,4,6-trichlorophenol) has a value of -0.2093333
2. Other halogenated aromatics like Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 has a value of 0.0396078

The target molecule is exactly the same as the first reference compound (just written in a slightly different SMILES notation), so it should have essentially the same property value.

Therefore, I predict the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl to be approximately:

-0.21

This prediction is based primarily on the direct match with the structurally identical compound in the training set, which provides high confidence in this prediction.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 3.490993473916635
Predicted Property:

1. It's a large, complex natural product-like structure
2. Contains multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters)
3. Has aromatic rings with methoxy substituents
4. Contains a methylenedioxy bridge (OCO)
5. Has multiple stereocenters and fused ring systems
6. Contains hydroxyl groups

Analyzing patterns from the training data:
- Larger, more complex molecules generally have higher positive values
- Molecules with multiple oxygen-containing groups tend to have moderate to high positive values
- Natural product-like structures with fused rings typically show values between 1.0 and 2.0
- The presence of aromatic rings with oxygen substituents generally contributes to positive values

Given these observations and comparing to similar complex structures in the training set (particularly the steroids and complex heterocycles), I would predict a value of approximately:

1.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, size, and functionality, placing it in a similar range to other complex natural product-like structures in the training set.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.3264893615479044
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A heterocyclic ring with multiple nitrogen atoms
- A thioether (CS-) group
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)
- An amino substituent (-N)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Compounds with heterocyclic rings containing multiple N atoms tend to have values around 0.4 to 0.7
- The presence of sulfur-containing groups typically increases the value slightly
- Compounds with tert-butyl groups, like CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C (0.64508515), are particularly relevant
- The amino and carbonyl groups typically contribute to moderate positive values

Considering all these structural features and their contributions, and particularly comparing to the most similar example CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C (0.64508515), I would predict a value of approximately:

0.58 to 0.62

My specific prediction would be: 0.60214573

This takes into account the similar electronic effects, molecular size, and functional group contributions observed in the training set.

Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.23802767047961354
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate, which has:
- An ethoxy group (CCOC)
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- A benzene ring (c1ccccc1)

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple molecules tend to have negative values
2. Aromatic compounds with polar substituents typically have values around -0.4 to 0.2
3. The presence of ester groups (C(=O)O) tends to make the value slightly less negative
4. The size and complexity of the molecule affects the value
5. Similar structures like CCCC(=O)OC and CCCCC(=O)OCC both have values around -0.48

Given these patterns and considering that this molecule:
- Has an aromatic ring (like many examples)
- Contains an ester group
- Is of moderate size
- Has similar structural elements to other molecules in the dataset

I would predict a property value of approximately -0.35 for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1.
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.23202295571749862
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (1-bromoheptane, CCCCCCCBr) by comparing it with the given examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a straight-chain alkyl bromide
2. Has 7 carbons in the main chain
3. Contains a single bromine as a terminal substituent
4. Similar in size and polarity to some of the given examples

Looking at relevant examples from the training set:
- CCCCCCC=C (heptene) has a value of -0.37182204
- CCCCCCCO (heptanol) has a value of -0.49274029
- Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (bromonaphthalene) has a value of 0.12145847

The target molecule is most similar to the heptene and heptanol examples, but with a bromine instead of a hydroxyl or double bond. Bromine typically contributes to a slightly higher value than a hydroxyl group but lower than aromatic systems.

Based on these considerations and the general trends in the dataset, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately:

-0.25

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The value should be negative like most simple aliphatic compounds in the set
2. It should be higher than the alcohol analog due to bromine's properties
3. It should be in a similar range to other C7-C8 straight chain compounds
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -1.5693914729171572
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

CO (methanol) is one of the simplest organic molecules containing a single carbon with a hydroxyl group. Looking at the training examples, I observe that:

1. Small, simple molecules generally have more negative values
2. Molecules with hydroxyl groups (-OH) tend to decrease the value
3. Very short carbon chains with polar groups typically have values between -1.4 and -0.8
4. The simplest molecules in the training set (like CCC at -1.26537801) have very negative values

Given these patterns, and considering that:
- CO is even smaller than most training examples
- It has a polar hydroxyl group
- It's a very simple structure
- It has just one carbon

I would predict the property value for CO (methanol) to be approximately:

-1.15

This prediction takes into account that it should be more negative than most larger alcohols in the training set, but perhaps not quite as negative as the simplest hydrocarbons due to its polarity.
