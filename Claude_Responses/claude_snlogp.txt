Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (fluorene) to be approximately:

0.45

This prediction takes into account that the value should be positive (like most similar aromatic systems in the dataset) but slightly higher than anthracene due to its more compact structure.

Considering these factors and comparing to similar structures in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.42

This prediction takes into account:
- The negative contribution from the sulfonamide group
- The moderating effect of the amino groups
- The para-substitution pattern
- The overall polarity of the molecule

True Property: -1.009059997939162
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains several key structural features:
- Tertiary amine (CCN)
- Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)
- Trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)
- Alkene group (C=C)
- Substituted benzene ring

2. Looking at patterns in the training data:
- Molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative values
- Molecules with tertiary amines often have positive values
- Complex substituted aromatics show varied values
- The presence of fluorine atoms can shift values
- Multiple electron-withdrawing groups tend to push towards negative values

3. Most similar structures from the training set:

- Compounds with tertiary amines
- Fluorinated compounds

Based on these considerations and the overall structural complexity, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.45 ± 0.15

This prediction takes into account the competing effects of the electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and trifluoromethyl) balanced against the electron-donating tertiary amine group, while considering the overall molecular size and complexity.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.39846642783083314
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (isopropyl formate, CC(C)OC=O) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with ester groups (OC=O) tend to have negative values
2. Short-chain molecules with branching and oxygen-containing functional groups often have values between -0.5 and -1.0
3. The most similar molecules in the training set are:
   - CC(C)CCOC=O (isopropyl formate with extra carbons) = -1.01530883
   - CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 (more complex ester) = 0.13719208
   - CC(C)C1(CC=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O (similar branching) = -0.02655256

Given that:
- This is a simple branched ester
- It has similar structural elements to CC(C)CCOC=O but is shorter
- Short-chain esters tend toward negative values
- The branching (isopropyl group) typically reduces the magnitude somewhat

I predict the property value would be approximately: -0.85

This takes into account the structural similarity to other esters while considering the shorter chain length and branching pattern characteristic of this molecule.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.7956459178619562
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethyl phenol:
- It has a benzene ring as the core structure
- Contains two methyl (C) substituents
- Has one hydroxyl (O) group
- It's a relatively simple aromatic structure

Looking at similar structures in the training set:

- Cc1cccc(N)c1 (methylated aromatic with substituent) has a value of 0.83881988
- Simple aromatics tend to have values ranging from -0.3 to 0.9
- Hydroxyl groups seem to push values slightly negative
- Multiple alkyl substituents tend to push values more positive

Considering these patterns and the structural similarity to the training examples, I would predict a value of approximately 0.45 for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1.

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of the hydroxyl group (slight negative influence)
- The two methyl groups (positive influence)
- The overall aromatic nature of the molecule
- The relative simplicity of the structure

I estimate 0.45 as the predicted property value.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.6135981766408594
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples and molecular patterns.

The target molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is an organophosphate compound with:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S))
- Methoxy groups (OC)
- A phenyl ring with methylthio (SC) and methyl (C) substituents

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has a value of -0.14639107
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has a value of 0.78238834
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a value of 0.55213991

The target molecule has the same phosphorothioate core but different substituents on the phenyl ring. The methylthio (SC) and methyl (C) groups are less electronegative than halogens (Cl, Br, I), which should result in a value intermediate between these examples but likely closer to the lower values.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.15 ± 0.10

This prediction takes into account the structural similarities to the training examples while considering the electronic effects of the different substituents.

These similar molecules with multiple chlorine substituents and aromatic/cyclic systems show property values in the range of 0.4 to 0.7.

The target molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than some of the examples
- Similar biphenyl core structure
- Similar substitution pattern

Based on these structural similarities and patterns, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.58

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly less chlorinated than some of the closest analogs but maintains the key structural features that appear to contribute to higher property values in this range.

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. Contains a short carbon chain (propyl)
3. Has oxygen-containing functional group
4. Similar in size to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- Simple alkanes (CCC) have values around -0.06
- Molecules with N(=O)=O groups tend to have lower values
- Short chain molecules with oxygen-containing groups show moderate values
- The presence of nitrogen-oxygen functional groups often reduces the property value

Considering these patterns and the molecule's structure, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.15

This prediction takes into account:
- The base contribution of the propyl chain
- The modifying effect of the nitro group
- The overall molecular size
- The presence of oxygen atoms
- The similarity to other small molecules with nitrogen-oxygen functional groups in the training set

True Property: 0.9509917595813188
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobromobenzene, where fluorine and bromine are substituted at different positions on the benzene ring.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of -0.89338502 (dihalogenated benzene)
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 patterns show similar meta-substitution
- Bromine-containing aromatics tend to have values in the negative range
- Fluorine substitutions typically lead to less negative values compared to chlorine

Considering these factors:
1. The presence of both F and Br (similar to Cl-Br example but with F instead)
2. The meta-substitution pattern
3. The generally negative values for halogenated aromatics
4. The moderating effect of fluorine compared to chlorine

I would predict a value of approximately -0.65 for Fc1cccc(Br)c1.

This prediction takes into account that it should be less negative than the Cl-Br analog (-0.89338502) due to fluorine's properties, but still maintain a negative value due to the bromine and the aromatic halogen substitution pattern.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.8607589347807408

1. A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
2. A phthalimide ring system
3. Ethoxy groups attached to phosphorus
4. Similar to some of the training examples containing cyclic imides

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O (-0.9153154) is very similar, just differing in the linking group
- Other molecules containing phthalimide-like structures tend to have values in the negative range
- Phosphorothioate containing compounds generally show negative values
- The presence of the cyclic imide system is associated with negative values in the training set

Based on these observations and the structural similarities, particularly with the closest analog in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.88

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly simpler than its closest analog (which had a value of -0.9153154) but maintains most of the key structural features that influence the property.

0.58

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has:
- A relatively simple structure
- One carbonyl group
- N-phenyl substitution
- A five-membered heterocycle
- Methyl substituents

This value represents my best estimate based on the structural patterns and trends observed in the training set.

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCC(=O)OCC - ethyl hexanoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Esters generally have values in the negative range
2. Longer carbon chains tend to make the values less negative
3. Similar compounds like CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC have a value of -0.71587992
4. Simpler esters like COC=O have more positive values (0.94610363)
5. The presence of C(=O)O group is a key structural feature

Given that this molecule is:
- A medium-length ester
- Has a straight carbon chain
- Contains 8 carbons total
- Has similar structural features to other esters in the dataset

Based on these observations and the molecule's structural features, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.65

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.3180235127894346
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (methyl benzoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Similar structures like CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) has a value of 0.08170301
2. The molecule in question differs only by having a methoxy (COC(=O)-) instead of ethoxy group
3. Compounds with aromatic rings and ester groups tend to have values between 0.0 and 0.9
4. The presence of the methoxy group versus ethoxy typically results in a slightly higher value

Given these observations and the structural similarity to ethyl benzoate (which has a value of 0.08170301), but considering the shorter alkyl chain in the ester group, I would predict the property value for methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1) to be approximately:

0.15 to 0.20

My specific prediction would be: 0.17523

This takes into account the slight increase in the property value due to the shorter alkyl chain while maintaining consistency with similar structures in the training set.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.7445586629040392
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (1,4-pentadiene) and make a prediction based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have negative values
2. Molecules with C=C bonds often have values in the -0.5 to -0.6 range
3. The closest structural analog in the training set is CC/C=C/C with a value of -0.61653543
4. The target molecule C=CCC=C has two double bonds instead of one, but maintains a similar carbon chain length

Considering these factors:
- The molecule is a simple hydrocarbon (suggesting negative value)
- It has two terminal double bonds (which would likely make it slightly more negative than single double bond analogs)
- Its size and complexity is similar to CC/C=C/C
- The conjugation potential of the two double bonds might slightly moderate the negative value

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.58

This prediction takes into account that it should be slightly less negative than CC/C=C/C (-0.61653543) due to the second double bond's influence, while still maintaining a similar magnitude due to its similar size and hydrocarbon nature.

For BrC(Br)Br specifically:
- It's a small molecule with three bromine atoms
- It's similar in structure to other trihalomethanes
- It has a symmetric structure
- All substituents are the same halogen (Br)

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for BrC(Br)Br to be approximately:

- Presence of chlorine typically contributes to negative values but is moderated by other groups
- Complex cyclic structures with multiple heteroatoms often have values in the 0.5 to 0.9 range

Considering all these factors and the structural similarities to known examples, I predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately 0.81

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, the presence of both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, and its similarity to other molecules in the training set, particularly other organophosphorus compounds.

1. The molecule contains several key structural features:
- A urea linkage (N-C(=O)-N)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring
- A heterocyclic ring system with N-N and O linkages
- A tert-butyl group
- N,N-dimethyl substitution

2. Looking at similar structural patterns in the training set:

- Chlorinated aromatics show varied values but often moderate positive to negative
- Complex heterocyclic structures tend to have values in the middle range
- Urea-like structures often contribute to negative values

3. Considering the overall complexity and the combination of these features, along with the molecular size and polarity:

I predict the property value to be approximately: -0.42

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has features that tend toward both negative values (N,N-dimethyl, urea) and positive values (complex ring system), but the negative-contributing features appear to be more dominant based on the training examples.

The target molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has several key structural features:
1. Contains multiple chlorine atoms (3 Cl)
2. Has two benzene rings connected by an oxygen bridge
3. Has a hydroxyl group (OH)
4. Contains aromatic systems

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl (0.59120862) - has similar OH and Cl substitution pattern
- c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2 (-0.93527643) - has similar biphenyl-like structure
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 (-0.20267289) - has similar dichlorinated biphenyl structure

The target molecule combines features of these compounds but with an oxygen bridge between rings rather than direct ring-ring connection. The presence of the oxygen bridge and hydroxyl group would likely make the property value intermediate between these reference compounds.

Based on these considerations and the overall patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account the moderating effect of the oxygen bridge and hydroxyl group on the chlorinated biphenyl system.

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.6165354284247254
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

The molecule CC/C=C\C is a cis-pent-2-ene, which is very similar to CC/C=C/C (trans-pent-2-ene) from the training set, which had a value of -0.61653543.

The only difference between these molecules is the stereochemistry of the double bond (cis vs trans). In general, cis-alkenes tend to be slightly less stable and have somewhat different physical properties than their trans counterparts due to steric interactions between the groups on the same side of the double bond.

Given this structural similarity and the general trend that cis-isomers often have slightly different property values than their trans counterparts, I would predict a value close to but slightly different from -0.61653543.

My prediction for CC/C=C\C would be approximately: -0.58

This prediction takes into account:
1. The very close structural similarity to the trans isomer
2. The typical small but noticeable differences between cis and trans isomers
3. The general range of values seen in the training set for similar-sized hydrocarbons

1. It's a relatively small, aliphatic ether molecule
2. Contains only C, H, and O atoms
3. Has a linear structure with an ether linkage
4. Similar in size and polarity to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

- Linear molecules of similar size tend to have moderate values
- Ethers specifically seem to trend towards slightly negative values

Considering these patterns and the molecule's structural features, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's more complex than methanol but simpler than many of the aromatic compounds
2. Contains an ether group which tends to decrease the value
3. Has a moderate carbon chain length
4. Shows similarity to other aliphatic oxygen-containing compounds in the training set

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is isobutylbenzene, which consists of:
- A benzene ring (c1ccccc1)
- An isobutyl group (CC(C)C-) attached to the benzene ring

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethyltoluene) has a value of 0.95701501
- Cc1ccccc1N (methylaniline) has a value of 0.83881988
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (p-cymene) has a value of -0.8355859

The target molecule is most similar to these structures, particularly the alkylated benzenes. It has:
- A single alkyl substituent like ethyltoluene
- A branched alkyl group like p-cymene
- No other functional groups

Considering these factors and the observed patterns, I predict the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 to be approximately:

0.92

This prediction takes into account that:
1. Simple alkylbenzenes tend to have positive values
2. The branching pattern is similar to other molecules in the dataset
3. The absence of other functional groups suggests a value closer to the simpler hydrocarbons

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.4759469345188248
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde) and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

Looking at the patterns in the given examples:
1. Simple aromatic systems tend to have moderate values
2. Presence of oxygen generally reduces the value compared to pure hydrocarbons
3. Small molecules with aldehyde groups often have values in the moderate negative to moderate positive range
4. The closest structural analogs in the training set are:
   - COc1ccccc1 (anisole) at 0.91347117
   - NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (salicylamide) at -0.10633924

Benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) has:
- A single benzene ring
- One aldehyde group (C=O)
- Similar size to some reference molecules
- Less polar than salicylamide but more polar than anisole

Based on these structural considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for benzaldehyde to be approximately:

0.35

This value takes into account that it should be:
- Lower than anisole (0.91) due to the more polar aldehyde group
- Higher than salicylamide (-0.11) due to having fewer polar groups
- In the moderate range typical for simple aromatic compounds with one oxygen-containing substituent

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.23383146327347365
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule contains:
- A furan ring with a nitro substituent
- A hydantoin ring system (cyclic urea)
- An imine linkage connecting these two systems

Looking at the patterns from the examples:
1. Molecules containing nitro groups tend to have negative or small positive values
2. Heterocyclic systems, especially those with multiple nitrogen atoms, often have positive values
3. The presence of oxygen atoms in cyclic systems seems to contribute to moderate positive values
4. Conjugated systems with multiple rings tend to have values in the middle range

Considering these factors:
- The nitro group would push towards negative values
- The hydantoin ring system and furan would contribute to positive values
- The conjugation through the imine linkage would moderate the overall value

Based on these considerations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.28

This prediction takes into account the competing electronic effects and structural features present in the molecule, while staying within the general range of values seen in the training set.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.8063489554441193
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally very similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training examples, which has a property value of -0.508044. 

The only difference is that our target molecule has an N-N single bond instead of an N=N double bond. This small structural difference would likely cause a slight change in the property value, but the overall value should remain in a similar range since:

1. Both molecules have two phenyl rings
2. Both have nitrogen atoms connecting these rings
3. The overall size and shape are very similar
4. The conjugation system is slightly different but still present

Given these considerations and the similarity to the known example, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.52

This prediction is slightly more negative than the azobenzene analog (-0.508044) because the single N-N bond would likely contribute to a small decrease in the property value based on patterns observed in other examples.

2. Contains multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)
3. Contains nitrogen atoms in an imide-like structure
4. Has a relatively compact, rigid structure

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1 (-0.77803585)
- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC (-1.01924452)
- O=C1CCCN1 (0.80533479)

The target molecule shares most structural similarity with these examples, particularly the cyclic imide/amide structures. It's more complex than O=C1CCCN1 but simpler than O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC.

Based on these patterns and considering the molecule's structural features, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.82

This prediction takes into account the presence of the cyclopentane ring, multiple carbonyl groups, and the overall compact structure, which tends to push the value towards the negative range based on the training examples.

- Larger conjugated systems like C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13 have more positive values (0.95912351)
- The presence of multiple halogens tends to push values towards the negative range

Considering these patterns and the structural features, I would predict a value of approximately -0.45 for this molecule. This takes into account:
- The negative pull from the three chlorines
- The size/conjugation of the biphenyl system
- The overall molecular complexity

This prediction represents a balance between the negative values typically seen for chlorinated aromatics and the more positive values associated with larger aromatic systems.

3. Cc1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (0.85050201) - different substitution pattern
4. Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (-0.75595283) - phenol with different substituent

The target molecule is most similar to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, which has a value of -0.20436832. The main difference is just the position of the methyl groups. Given this close structural similarity and the general trend that phenols tend to have negative values in this dataset, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.22

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has:
- A phenol group (OH) which tends to drive values negative
- Two methyl groups similar to the closest reference compound
- Similar size and complexity to compounds with values in this range

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.3305679059457488
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 4 chlorine atoms. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl atoms) has value 0.67449076
2. Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (5 Cl atoms) has value -0.87403137
3. Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl (4 Cl atoms) has value -0.93853797

The target molecule is most similar to these structures, particularly the first two as they are also biphenyl-based. However, it has fewer chlorine atoms than the first two examples, which should make its properties intermediate between simple biphenyls and heavily chlorinated biphenyls.

Considering these factors and the general trend in the training data, I predict the property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl would be approximately:

0.45

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's a biphenyl structure (like examples that tend toward positive values)
2. It has chlorine substituents (which tend to pull values lower)
3. It has fewer chlorines than the most similar examples
4. The chlorine pattern is more symmetrical than some of the training examples

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (2-methylbut-2-ene) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice that:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have values between -1.0 and 1.0
2. Small molecules with double bonds often have slightly negative values
3. Branched alkenes show values in a similar range

- Small molecules with double bonds tend toward negative values

Given these patterns and the relatively simple structure of CC=C(C)C, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.72

This prediction takes into account the molecule's:
- Small size
- Presence of a double bond
- Branched structure
- Similarity to other simple hydrocarbons in the training set

4. Highly symmetrical molecules often have more extreme values

ClCCl (dichloromethane) is:
- A very small molecule
- Contains two chlorine atoms
- Highly symmetrical
- Similar in some ways to CCl4 which had a value around -0.98

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict the property value for ClCCl to be approximately:

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms at positions 2,4,6 and a hydroxyl group.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (very similar, just different chlorine positions) has value 0.56947632
2. Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 (trihalogenated benzene) has value -1.00193745
3. Other halogenated compounds show varying values

The target molecule is most similar to the first example, which has the exact same functional groups (OH and 3 Cl) on a benzene ring, just in slightly different positions. Given this very close structural similarity, I would expect the property value to be close to 0.56947632.

Taking into account the slight difference in chlorine positions and their electronic effects, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.54

This prediction is based primarily on the very close structural analog in the training set, with a small adjustment for the different substitution pattern.

True Property: -0.8027566652556427
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A heterocyclic ring with multiple nitrogen atoms
- A thioether (CS-) group
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)
- An amino substituent (-N)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Compounds with heterocyclic rings containing multiple N atoms tend to have negative values
- The presence of sulfur-containing groups often leads to moderate negative values
- Molecules with tert-butyl groups show varying values but often trend towards negative
- The combination of polar groups (C=O, NH2) with heterocycles appears in several examples with values around -0.4 to -0.6

Based on these structural features and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C to be approximately:

-0.48

This prediction takes into account the molecule's similarity to other heterocyclic compounds in the training set, particularly those containing multiple nitrogen atoms and bulky alkyl substituents, while also considering the effect of the thioether and amino groups.

True Property: 0.08170301445663165
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ethyl benzoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings generally have higher values
2. Presence of ester groups (C(=O)O) tends to give moderate positive values
3. Simple ethyl esters show values around 0.7-0.8
4. Benzoate derivatives typically show moderate positive values

Comparing specifically to similar structures:
- CCCC(=O)OCC (ethyl pentanoate) has value 0.78024874
- Simple aromatic compounds like toluene derivatives have values around 0.9
- When combining aromatic rings with ester groups, values tend to moderate somewhat

Based on these observations and the structural features of ethyl benzoate (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1), I predict the property value would be approximately:

0.65

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Lower than simple aromatic compounds
- Similar but slightly lower than aliphatic ethyl esters

- Has a bromine terminal group
- Similar in structure to some of the aliphatic compounds shown
- Simpler than most of the complex aromatic compounds in the training set

Considering these factors and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's linear nature, the presence of the bromine atom, and its similarity to other aliphatic compounds in the training set.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 0.13474957304895288
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

CO (methanol) is one of the simplest organic molecules containing a single carbon with a hydroxyl group. Looking at the training examples, I notice:

1. Small molecules tend to have values between -0.5 and 0.5
2. Molecules with hydroxyl groups (-OH) often have moderate negative values
3. Very simple molecules like CCC (propane) have values close to zero (-0.05978795)
4. Alcohols like CCC(C)CO have negative values (-0.44544822)
5. The presence of oxygen typically pushes towards slightly negative values

Based on these observations and considering that methanol (CO) is:
