2. Simple aromatic systems generally have negative or low positive values
3. The target molecule is a tricyclic aromatic system with two benzene rings fused to a five-membered ring
4. It's structurally simpler than anthracene but has a similar conjugated system
5. It lacks functional groups that tend to give extreme values (like phosphates or multiple halogens)

Comparing specifically to similar structures:
- Anthracene (c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1) has value 820.65
- Simple benzene derivatives tend to be in the -300 to -800 range
- Fused ring systems without heteroatoms generally give moderate positive values

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to other fused aromatic systems in the training set, I predict the property value for fluorene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13) to be approximately:

425.7

This value takes into account that fluorene should have a lower value than anthracene (due to fewer rings) but higher than simple aromatic compounds due to its fused ring system.

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I notice this is a cis isomer of pent-2-ene (CC/C=C\C), while one of the training examples (CC/C=C/C) is the trans isomer. The property values appear to be related to molecular structure and configuration.

- The overall size and complexity of the molecule

I predict the property value would be approximately: -583.42

This prediction takes into account that this molecule is slightly more complex than the simple brominated aromatics in the training set, but has similar structural elements, and the acetamide group would likely push the value more negative than the simple halogenated aromatics.

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -184.04397970285754
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecular property prediction task, I notice this appears to be some form of calculated molecular property (possibly related to energy or molecular descriptors given the range and scale of values).

Looking at the training examples and analyzing the target molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 (isobutylbenzene):

1. It's a relatively simple aromatic compound with an isobutyl substituent
2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (p-ethyltoluene) has a value of -371.4198897
- Cc1cccc2ccccc12 (1-methylnaphthalene) has a value of -186.49314955
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (p-isopropyltoluene) has a value of -210.32743803

The target molecule is most similar in size and structure to these examples, particularly the alkylated benzenes. It has a slightly larger alkyl group than ethyltoluene but smaller than the naphthalene derivatives.

Based on these structural analogies and the observed trends in the training set, I would predict the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 to be approximately:

-290.5

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The value should be negative based on similar structures
2. It should be in a similar range to other monocyclic aromatic compounds with alkyl substituents
3. The slightly larger alkyl group compared to ethylbenzene derivatives would likely move the value in this direction

True Property: -770.0165893561809
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this data, I notice that the property values seem to correlate with molecular complexity, presence of certain functional groups, and overall structure. 

The target molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) is a relatively simple aromatic compound with a formyl (CHO) group attached to a benzene ring.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple aromatic compounds tend to have negative values

2. It has a cyclic urea structure (dihydropyrimidine-2,4-dione core)
3. Contains a C=N bond (imine/Schiff base)

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is very similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training set, which has a value of 85.9317314. The only difference is that our target molecule has an NH group instead of a N=N group.

Looking at other patterns in the training data:
1. Molecules with similar size and aromatic rings tend to have values in the range of -600 to +900
2. The presence of N-N bonds typically doesn't lead to extreme values
3. The molecule is symmetric with two phenyl rings, similar to several training examples
4. The reduction of a double bond to a single bond often results in a slight increase in the property value

Given that the very similar N=N compound has a value of 85.9317314, and considering that the reduction of the double bond typically increases the value somewhat, I would predict the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 to be approximately:

92.45

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure. Looking at the training examples, I notice:

1. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher positive values
2. The most similar structure in the training set is Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a value of 1959.39696348
3. The target molecule has fewer chlorines (6 Cl atoms) compared to the similar example (10 Cl atoms)

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -1120.0085114355047
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

ClCCl is a simple molecule (dichloromethane) with two chlorine atoms attached to a methylene (CH2) group.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Small halogenated compounds tend to have negative values
2. Similar compounds in the training set:
   - ClCCCl has a value of -909.54871668
   - Other small halogenated compounds also tend to have negative values in the -900 range

The target molecule ClCCl is:
- Smaller than ClCCCl by one carbon
- Has similar electronic properties due to the two chlorine atoms
- More symmetric than ClCCCl

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict the property value for ClCCl to be approximately:

-932.5

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It should be negative like similar halogenated compounds
2. It should be in a similar range to ClCCCl
3. The smaller size and higher symmetry would likely make it slightly more negative than ClCCCl

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -545.8505010912911
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The molecule "Cc1cccc(C)c1O" is a dimethylphenol, specifically 2,6-dimethylphenol. Looking at the training examples, I notice:

1. Molecules containing phenol groups (Oc1cccc(O)c1) tend to have negative values
2. Simple aromatic structures with methyl substituents generally have moderate values
3. The closest structural analogs in the training set are:
   - CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (-151.28358897)
   - Oc1cccc(O)c1 (-840.09136553)

The target molecule is simpler than CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O but has a similar substitution pattern with methyl groups and a hydroxyl group on a benzene ring. It should have a value less negative than the dihydroxybenzene (-840) but in a similar range to the methylated phenol (-151).

Based on these observations and the structural similarities, I predict the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O to be approximately:

-165.4

This prediction takes into account the structural features and the trends observed in the training set while considering the relative simplicity of the target molecule compared to its closest analogs.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 727.9493451601973
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 4 chlorine atoms. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (5 Cl atoms) has value 939.07
2. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl atoms) has value 1137.59

The target molecule has:
- Biphenyl core structure (similar to examples)
- 4 Cl atoms (fewer than examples)
- Similar substitution pattern
- Slightly less complex than the training examples

Given that:
- The value seems to increase with number of chlorine atoms
- The target has fewer chlorines than both reference molecules
- The basic structure is very similar
- Values for similar PCBs are in the 900-1100 range

I predict the property value would be approximately 885.4

This prediction takes into account that it should be lower than the 5-chloro example (939.07) but still relatively high due to the 4 chlorine atoms and similar biphenyl structure.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -1009.5348178854373
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule CC=C(C)C is 2-methylbut-2-ene, a relatively simple branched alkene.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Smaller, simpler molecules tend to have negative or low positive values
2. Alkanes and simple alkenes generally have values between -200 and 200
3. The presence of double bonds seems to slightly increase the value compared to similar saturated structures
4. Branching appears to have a moderate effect on the value

Comparing with similar molecules in the training set:
- CCCCCCCCC=C (dec-1-ene) has a value of 109.09180543
- CCCCCCCC (octane) has a value of -147.41229893
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (p-cymene) has a value of -210.32743803

The target molecule is much smaller than these examples but has similar features (branching and a double bond).

Based on these patterns and considering the molecule's small size, branching, and presence of a double bond, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-180.5

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Negative (like many small molecules in the set)
- Higher than fully saturated analogs due to the double bond
- Affected by the branching pattern
- In line with the general magnitude seen for molecules of similar size and complexity

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -1120.0085114355047
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

ClCCl is a very simple molecule (dichloromethane/methylene chloride) with the following characteristics:
- It's a small molecule with just two carbons
- Contains two chlorine atoms
- Has a symmetric structure
- No complex functional groups
- Similar in size/complexity to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
- Simple halogenated compounds tend to have negative values
- Molecules with chlorine atoms often contribute to more negative values
- Smaller molecules generally have values in the -100 to -800 range
- Symmetric molecules tend to have more moderate values

Based on similar structures in the training set and considering these patterns, particularly looking at:
- ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl which has a value of -735.19566251
- Other small halogenated compounds in the dataset

I would predict the property value for ClCCl to be approximately:

-612.4

This prediction takes into account the molecule's simplicity, symmetry, and the presence of two chlorine atoms, while being proportionally scaled based on similar structures in the training set.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -285.9297943322667
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with the chlorine atoms and hydroxyl group as substituents on the benzene ring.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (-288.44818324) - This is very similar to our target molecule, just with a slightly different chlorine arrangement
2. ClCC (-1159.85989207) - Simple chlorinated compound
3. Other aromatic compounds with substituents show values in similar ranges

The target molecule is most similar to Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a value of -288.44818324. Since our target molecule has the same number of chlorines and hydroxyl group, just in a different arrangement on the benzene ring, I would expect a very similar value.

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl to be approximately:

-285.32467891

This prediction takes into account that the slight change in chlorine positions would likely result in a small deviation from the similar reference molecule, but the overall electronic and structural properties would remain very similar.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 4004.0884119254965
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecular structure and the given examples, I notice several patterns:

1. Larger, more complex molecules generally have higher positive values
2. Molecules with multiple rings, especially fused rings, tend to have higher values
3. The presence of oxygen-containing groups (ethers, esters) typically increases the value
4. The presence of complex sugar-like moieties (as seen in some examples) contributes positively

The target molecule contains:
- Multiple fused rings
- Several ether linkages (OC)
- A lactone group (COC=O)
- A complex sugar-like moiety
- Multiple oxygen-containing substituents
- A methylenedioxy group (OCO)

Comparing this to similar complex structures in the training set, particularly those with sugar moieties and multiple rings (like the examples with values around 1100-2400), and considering the overall size and complexity, I would predict a value of approximately:

2150.45

This estimation takes into account the molecule's structural complexity, the presence of multiple oxygen-containing groups, and its similarity to other large, complex molecules in the training set with values in this range.

2. Has a thioether (CSc-) group
3. Contains a carbonyl group
4. Has a t-butyl substituent (C(C)(C)C)
5. Has an amino substituent (-N)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C (808.40217094) is particularly relevant as it contains similar structural elements (nnc, t-butyl group)
- Other heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen atoms tend to have values in the 300-900 range
- The presence of sulfur and multiple nitrogen atoms typically contributes to higher values

Based on these observations and the structural similarities, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

775.32

This prediction takes into account the similar electronic and structural features seen in the training set, particularly the presence of the nnc ring system, sulfur atom, and t-butyl group.

True Property: -294.5235917532981
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break this down:

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate, which contains:
- An ethoxy group (CCOC)
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- A benzene ring (c1ccccc1)

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple molecules tend to have negative values
2. Aromatic compounds with similar size have values in the -300 to -600 range
3. Esters (compounds with C(=O)O) typically show values in the -300 to -400 range
4. The complexity and size of the molecule affects the magnitude
5. Benzene-containing molecules with similar substituents show comparable values

Considering these patterns and the structural similarity to other molecules in the training set, particularly other aromatic esters and benzene derivatives, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-421.53

This prediction takes into account the molecule's size, the presence of the ester group, and the benzene ring, while considering the general trends observed in the training data.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 139.49632952630054
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule CCCCCCCBr is a relatively simple linear alkyl bromide with 7 carbons.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple linear molecules tend to have negative values
2. Presence of halogens (like Br, Cl) tends to make values less negative or slightly positive
3. Longer carbon chains tend to have values in the -300 to -400 range
4. The example "Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1" (a brominated naphthalene) has a value of 13.86349831
5. Simple molecules like "CI" have quite negative values (-727.75551894)

Given that CCCCCCCBr is:
- A linear molecule (suggesting negative value)
- Contains a bromine (which would make it less negative than a pure hydrocarbon)
- Has a moderate carbon chain length
- Is structurally simpler than most molecules in the training set

I predict the property value would be approximately: -285.43267891

This prediction takes into account that it should be:

   - Simple, small molecules tend to have negative values
   - The values seem to correlate somewhat with molecular complexity
   - Similar structural features tend to have similar value ranges
   - Small alcohols in the training set have values in the -300 to -800 range
   - The simplest molecules in the set (like CCC) have values around -1200

3. CO is:
   - One of the simplest possible organic molecules
   - Contains an oxygen (like alcohols)
   - Smaller than methanol or ethanol
   - Has similar polarity to some of the simple molecules in the training set

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, particularly looking at other simple molecules and those containing oxygen, I would predict the property value for CO to be approximately:

-1100.5

This prediction takes into account that CO is very simple (suggesting a more negative value like other simple molecules in the set) while also considering its oxygen-containing nature and relative size compared to other molecules in the training set.
