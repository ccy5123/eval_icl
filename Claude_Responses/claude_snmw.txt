Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
1. Long chain esters: CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC has value 0.10764897
2. The target molecule is also a straight chain ester, just two carbons shorter
3. Most long-chain aliphatic compounds in the examples have values between -0.2 and 0.2

Looking at the molecule:
- It's an alcohol with a branched carbon chain
- Contains a primary alcohol group (-CH2OH)
- Has two methyl groups on the same carbon (geminal dimethyl)
- Has a straight chain of 4 carbons

Looking at similar structures in the training set:

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.6763729529176076
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is methylnaphthalene, which consists of:
- A naphthalene core (two fused benzene rings)
- A methyl (CH3) substituent

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (dimethylnaphthalene): -0.50976952
2. c1ccccc1 (benzene): 0.58507514
3. Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (methylanthracene): 0.84562998

The target molecule is most structurally similar to the first example (dimethylnaphthalene), but with one less methyl group. The presence of one methyl group instead of two should make the property value less negative than -0.50976952.

Considering the structural patterns and the effect of methyl substitution seen in the training set, I would predict the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 to be approximately:

-0.25

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's a naphthalene derivative (more complex than benzene)
- It has one methyl substituent (less than the dimethyl example)

True Property: -0.6746061633333544
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and my understanding of molecular structures.

The target molecule is a barbituric acid derivative with an alkyl substituent. Looking at the training examples, I notice:

1. Similar cyclic structures with multiple carbonyl groups tend to have values close to 0
2. The presence of unsaturation (CC=C) generally increases the value slightly
3. The example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a value of 0.06215454, and is very similar to our target molecule, just differing in the alkyl chain length

The target molecule differs from this close example by having a longer alkyl chain (C(C)CCC instead of just C). Based on the training data, longer alkyl chains tend to increase the value somewhat, but not dramatically when they're part of a larger structure.

Considering these factors, I would predict a value slightly higher than the similar example, but not dramatically different.

My prediction for O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be approximately 0.12

This takes into account:
- The base similarity to the known barbituric acid derivative
- The slight positive contribution from the longer alkyl chain
- The maintained unsaturation effect from the CC=C group

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to other aromatic compounds in the training set, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's a purely hydrocarbon structure
- It's more compact than the larger PAHs that showed more negative values
- It lacks the complexity of molecules with very high positive values
- Its structure is relatively simple compared to many examples

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 0.11668174015182384
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 has several key features:
1. Contains a sulfonamide group -S(=O)(=O)-
2. Has an aromatic ring (benzene) with para-substitution
3. Contains multiple amino groups (-NH2)
4. Has a guanidine-like structure (-NC(=N)N-)

Looking at the training examples:
- Molecules with sulfonyl groups tend to have values around 0.8-0.9
- Aromatic systems with polar substituents often have negative values
- Multiple nitrogen-containing groups typically push the value towards negative
- Para-substituted benzenes with polar groups tend to have values in the -0.6 to -0.8 range

Considering all these factors and the overall polarity and size of the molecule, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.72

This prediction takes into account the competing effects of the sulfonyl group (which tends to increase the value) and the multiple amino groups (which tend to decrease the value), while considering the overall molecular structure and patterns seen in the training set.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.9400288811884243
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains several key structural features:
- Tertiary amine (CCN)
- Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)
- Trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)
- Alkene group (C=C)
- Substituted benzene ring

2. Looking at patterns in the training data:
- Molecules with nitro groups tend to have values ranging from 0.3 to 0.9
- Presence of fluorine atoms often pulls values toward negative or moderate positive
- Tertiary amines generally contribute to positive values
- Complex substituted aromatics tend to have moderate values

3. Considering the overall molecular complexity and the combination of electron-withdrawing groups (nitro, CF3) with electron-donating groups (amine), I would predict this molecule to have a moderate positive value.

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.43

This prediction takes into account the competing electronic effects and structural similarity to several training examples, particularly those containing nitro groups and substituted aromatics.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.28854659590023657
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, a relatively simple ester.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple esters tend to have values between -0.2 and 0.2
2. Short-chain compounds with oxygen-containing functional groups often have values closer to 0
3. The most similar molecules in the training set are:
   - CC(C)CCOC=O (formate ester) with value -0.00018234
   - CCOC(=O)C (acetate ester) with values around 0.97324168
   - CC(C)C1(CC=C) containing isopropyl group with value -0.68514093

Given that this molecule:
- Is a simple formate ester
- Has an isopropyl group
- Is smaller than CC(C)CCOC=O but has similar functionality
- Contains oxygen in an ester linkage

I predict the property value would be approximately: -0.15

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 0.5276368111337933
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethyl phenol (a benzene ring with two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group).

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple phenols (like c1ccccc1O) have values around -0.71
2. Methylated aromatics tend to increase the value slightly compared to their non-methylated counterparts
3. The presence of hydroxyl groups (-OH) on aromatics generally leads to moderate negative to moderate positive values
4. The molecule is relatively simple compared to many of the training examples

Considering these factors:
- Starting from the base phenol value (-0.71)
- Adding the effect of two methyl groups which typically increase the value
- The molecule's relatively simple structure
- Similar structures in the training set tend to have values in the -0.7 to 0.3 range

I predict the property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 to be approximately:

-0.25

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a higher value than simple phenol due to the methyl groups, but still maintains some of the negative character due to the hydroxyl group.

1. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S))
2. It has methoxy groups (OC) attached to phosphorus
3. It has an aromatic ring with methylthio (SC) and methyl (C) substituents
4. It's structurally similar to some organophosphate/organothiophosphate compounds in the training set

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has a value of -0.81340038
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has a value of -0.13236549
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a value of 0.76735261

The target molecule replaces the halogen substituents with SC and C groups, which generally make the molecule slightly more lipophilic. Based on the pattern seen in the training data and the nature of the substituents, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.15 to 0.25

My specific prediction would be: 0.21463578

This takes into account that the molecule is less electronegative than the chlorinated analogs but maintains similar structural features, and the methylthio group typically has electronic effects intermediate between halogens and alkyl groups.

1) The target molecule contains multiple chlorine substituents (5 Cl atoms) and has a biphenyl-like structure.

2) Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- Molecules with multiple chlorines tend to have negative values
- Particularly relevant examples:
  * Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (-0.88378934)

3) The target molecule has:
- A biphenyl core (similar to some training examples)
- 5 chlorine substituents
- Similar overall size and connectivity to some of the negative-valued examples

4) Considering these factors, especially the similarity to other polychlorinated biphenyls in the training set, and the general trend of heavily chlorinated aromatics having values in the -0.7 to -0.9 range.

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.82

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to other polychlorinated compounds in the training set while considering the slightly different substitution pattern.

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.37073441891690634
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O, propyl nitrite) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. Contains a short carbon chain (propyl)
3. Has oxygen-containing functional group
4. Similar in size to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple alkanes (CCC) have values around -0.55

- Small molecules with oxygen-containing groups show varied values
- The presence of nitro groups generally seems to push values higher

Considering these patterns and the molecule's specific features, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The base alkyl chain would contribute a negative value (like CCC at -0.55898099)
2. The nitro group typically increases the value
3. The size and complexity is relatively low
4. It's more complex than simple alkanes but simpler than many aromatic compounds in the training set

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.5428923381521296
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a benzene ring substituted with both fluorine and bromine in different positions.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of 0.80166258 (dihalogen substituted benzene)
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 and COc1ccccc1Cl have values around 0.64919304
- Bromine-containing aromatics generally show positive values
- Meta-substituted patterns tend to have values slightly lower than para-substituted ones

Considering these patterns:
1. The presence of halogens (F, Br) typically leads to positive values
2. The meta-substitution pattern might slightly reduce the value compared to para-substitution
3. The combination of F and Br should give a value similar to, but slightly lower than Cl-Br combination

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 to be approximately 0.72

This prediction takes into account that:
- It should be lower than the Cl-Br para-substituted compound (0.80166258)
- But higher than most single-halogen substituted compounds
- The fluorine typically has a slightly different effect than chlorine
- The meta-substitution pattern typically gives slightly different values than para-substitution

1. It's a bicyclic structure
2. Contains an OH group
3. Has multiple methyl substituents
4. Contains mostly sp3 carbons
5. Has a relatively compact, rigid structure

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Molecules with OH groups tend to have negative values
- Bicyclic structures often have values around -0.2 to 0.4
- The presence of methyl groups tends to make values less negative
- Compact rigid structures tend to have moderate values

Considering these factors and comparing to the most similar structures in the training set (especially other bicyclic compounds with OH groups), I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.25

This prediction takes into account the molecule's structural features and the trends observed in the training data, particularly the moderating effect of the methyl groups on what would otherwise likely be a more negative value due to the OH group.

The most similar molecule in the training set is CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O with a value of 1.01028477

Given these observations and the structural similarities, I predict the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O to be approximately:

0.95

This prediction takes into account that the target molecule is slightly simpler than its closest analog in the training set (missing the CCl group) but maintains most of the key structural features that contribute to higher values.

True Property: 0.5254558332171928
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCC(=O)OCC - ethyl hexanoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Longer chain esters tend to have values around -0.7 to 0.7
2. Simple aliphatic compounds with similar chain lengths (like CCCCC) have values around 0.9
3. The presence of ester group (C(=O)O) typically reduces the value compared to pure alkanes
4. Molecules with similar structural features like CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC have a value of -0.71237752

For CCCCCC(=O)OCC:
- It's a medium-length ester
- Has a linear alkyl chain

The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is methyl benzoate, which has:
- A benzoic acid ester structure
- One aromatic ring
- A methoxy carbonyl group

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) has a value of 0.00133464
- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 has a value of -0.88745266 (but this has an additional OH group)
- Other esters like CC(C)OC(=O)C have values around -0.87

The query molecule is most similar to ethyl benzoate (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1), just differing by one methylene group. Since the structures are very similar and the property values seem to be sensitive to small structural changes, I would predict a value close to but slightly different from ethyl benzoate.

My prediction for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be approximately 0.02

This takes into account that:
1. It's very similar to ethyl benzoate
2. It's slightly smaller (one CH2 less)
3. The property appears to be somewhat sensitive to small structural changes

- Complex heterocycles with multiple heteroatoms tend to give values in the -0.3 to 0.3 range

3. Considering the overall complexity and the combination of these features, I would predict a value around:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has both polar and non-polar regions, multiple heteroatoms, and a balanced mix of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups. The value should be slightly negative due to the chlorine substituent and the complex heterocyclic system, but not extremely negative due to the presence of the lipophilic tert-butyl group and N,N-dimethyl substituent.

Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice that this molecule (CC/C=C\C) is very similar to CC/C=C/C which has a property value of 0.98920919. The only difference is the stereochemistry of the double bond (cis vs trans).

In general, cis-trans isomers often have similar but slightly different properties, with trans isomers typically being slightly more stable and having slightly higher values for many properties due to reduced steric hindrance.

Given that the trans isomer (CC/C=C/C) has a value of 0.98920919, and considering the general trend that cis isomers often have slightly lower values, I would predict the property value for CC/C=C\C to be approximately:

0.95

- Similar ethers in the training set tend to have values around 0 to 0.3

Based on these patterns and considering the molecular structure, I would predict the property value for CCCOCC to be approximately:

0.15

This prediction takes into account the molecule's relatively simple structure, the presence of the ether linkage, and its moderate chain length, placing it in a moderate range of the observed values in the training set.

Key observations:
1. The molecule contains a benzene ring with an aliphatic branched chain
2. Similar structures in the training set include:
   - CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (property: 0.36316148)
   - CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (property: 1.00744804)

2. Has a nitro group (-NO2)
3. Contains multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)
4. Has a hydrazine-like linkage
5. Contains a cyclic urea-like structure

Analyzing the training examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative values
- Heterocyclic compounds often have values in the negative range
- Multiple polar groups (C=O, NO2) tend to push values more negative
- The presence of conjugated systems affects the value

Based on these observations and the structural similarities with other molecules in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

1. It's structurally similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (azobenzene) from the examples, which has a value of 0.06644878
2. The main difference is that our target molecule has a single N-N bond instead of a N=N double bond
3. The molecule contains two phenyl rings, similar to several examples in the training set
4. It's a relatively planar, aromatic system

Given these observations, and particularly noting its similarity to azobenzene but with slightly different electronic properties due to the single vs. double bond, I would predict a value close to but slightly different from the azobenzene example.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.7993739451459048
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 4 chlorine atoms. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (-0.88378934) - Very similar structure with 6 chlorines
2. Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (0.97924725) - Similar biphenyl core with 5 chlorines
3. Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl (-0.88570899) - Different core but similar halogen pattern

The target molecule has:
- Biphenyl core like examples 1 and 2
- 4 chlorines (less than examples 1 and 2)
- Similar substitution pattern to example 1

Given these comparisons and considering that:
- It has fewer chlorines than the most similar structures
- The chlorine positioning is more symmetrical than example 1
- The overall structure is between examples 1 and 2 in terms of complexity

I predict the property value would be approximately -0.45

This takes into account that it should be less negative than example 1 (-0.88) but not as positive as example 2 (0.97), considering the structural similarities and differences.

The target molecule CC=C(C)C has these characteristics:
- It's a small hydrocarbon
- Contains one double bond
- Has branching (two methyl groups)
- Very simple structure
- Similar to some of the simpler alkenes in the training set

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I predict the property value would be approximately:

0.85

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a very small molecule with just two carbons
2. It has two chlorine atoms
3. It's symmetric
4. It has no complex functional groups
5. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a value of -0.88793359

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 1.0072640586337518
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms in multiple positions and a hydroxyl group.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (very similar structure) has a value of 1.00726406
2. Other halogenated aromatics like Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 has a value of 0.23932446
3. Chlorinated compounds generally show values ranging from negative to positive

The target molecule is most similar to the first example (Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl), with just a slight difference in the position of chlorine atoms.

- A thioether group (CS-)
- A triazine ring with a carbonyl group
- A hydrazine substituent (-N-N)
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

2. Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Molecules containing nitrogen heterocycles tend to have values around 0.3 to 0.8
- The presence of sulfur-containing groups often contributes to moderate positive values
- Molecules with tert-butyl groups typically show positive values
- The combination of carbonyl and amino groups often leads to positive values

3. Most similar molecules from the training set:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C (0.77454651)
- CCNc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(OC)n1 (0.38266372)

Based on these considerations and the structural similarities with the training examples, I predict the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C to be approximately:

0.65

This prediction takes into account the positive contributions from the sulfur-containing group, the nitrogen heterocycle, and the tert-butyl group, while considering the moderating effect of the carbonyl and hydrazine substituents.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.0013346449094190672
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ethyl benzoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with ester groups (C(=O)O) tend to have positive values
2. Simple aromatic systems with ester substituents generally show values between 0.5 and 1.0
3. The presence of ethoxy groups (CCOC) combined with aromatic systems tends to push values higher
4. Similar structures like CCCCC(=O)OCC and CCCC(=O)OC have values around 0.97

Given that CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1:
- Contains an ester group
- Has a simple benzene ring
- Contains an ethoxy group
- Is structurally similar to other esters in the dataset

Based on these observations and the structural patterns, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.92 for this molecule.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.21498463137913384
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (1-bromoheptane, CCCCCCCBr) by comparing it with the given examples and looking for patterns in molecular structure and corresponding property values.

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
1. CCCCCCC=C (heptene) has a value of -0.34676815

Key observations:
1. Bromine-containing compounds tend to have positive values
2. Linear alkyl chains tend to have values around -0.3 to 0.7
3. The presence of a halogen (Br, I, Cl) generally increases the value compared to the corresponding hydrocarbon
4. Simple alkyl halides tend to have values in the positive range

Based on these patterns, and considering that:
- The molecule is a primary alkyl bromide
- It has a long hydrocarbon chain (7 carbons)
