2. Most oxygen-containing and hydroxyl-containing molecules in the dataset tend to have positive values
3. The complexity and number of OH groups seems to correlate with higher positive values

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be approximately:

-155.67144145

This prediction is made because:
1. It shares the same functional groups (OH and methyl groups)
2. It has similar molecular size
3. The closest structural analog in the training set has this value
4. The substitution pattern difference likely wouldn't cause a dramatic change in this property

Looking at the patterns in the given examples, I notice that molecules with similar structural features tend to have similar property values. The target molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl has the following key characteristics:

1. It's a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure
2. Contains multiple chlorine atoms
3. Has two connected aromatic rings
4. Similar to other chlorinated aromatic compounds in the training set

Looking at similar molecules in the examples:
- Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl : -674.49075948
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl : -674.49075948

These molecules are very similar to our target molecule in terms of:
- Having chlorine substituents
- Biphenyl core structure
- Similar molecular size and complexity

Based on these observations and the consistent pattern that similar chlorinated biphenyls show the same value in the training set, I predict the property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl to be:

-674.49075948

This prediction is based on the strong structural similarity to other chlorinated biphenyls in the training set that consistently show this exact value.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Looking at the patterns in the given examples, I notice several key points:

1. Simple hydrocarbons (like CCCCCCCC) tend to have a value around -674.49075948
2. Small molecules with C=C bonds but without other functional groups tend to have values between -674 and 0
3. The target molecule CC=C(C)C is a simple branched alkene (2-methylbut-2-ene)
4. It's a relatively small hydrocarbon with one double bond
5. It doesn't contain any complex functional groups or aromatic systems

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value for CC=C(C)C to be approximately:

-674.49075948

This prediction is based on the fact that the molecule is a simple hydrocarbon, and many similar simple hydrocarbons in the training set (including alkanes and molecules with aromatic rings) show this exact value. While it contains a double bond, it doesn't have any other functional groups that would significantly alter this baseline value according to the patterns observed in the training data.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. Molecules containing only carbon and hydrogen (like simple alkanes, alkenes) tend to have values around -674.49075948

2. Molecules with simple alcohols (-OH groups) often have values around -155.67144145

3. Small halogenated compounds (especially chlorinated) seem to follow similar patterns to simple hydrocarbons

The target molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane) is a very simple halogenated compound with:
- One carbon atom
- Two chlorine atoms
- Small, symmetric structure
- Similar to other small halogenated compounds in the training set

Based on its similarity to other small halogenated compounds in the dataset and particularly looking at examples like "ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl" which has a value of -674.49075948, I would predict that ClCCl would have a property value of:

-674.49075948

This prediction is based on the molecule's structural similarity to other small halogenated compounds in the training set and the apparent pattern that simple halogenated hydrocarbons tend to have values in this range.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -155.6714414457389
Predicted Property:
Looking at the patterns in the given examples, I notice that molecules with similar structural features tend to have similar property values. For the target molecule "Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl", I observe:

1. It contains a phenol group (OH on benzene ring)
2. It has three chlorine substituents
3. It's similar to the example "Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl" which has a property value of -155.67144145

The target molecule is actually identical in composition to one of the example molecules (Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl), just with a slightly different arrangement of the chlorine atoms. Given that they are structural isomers with the same functional groups and very similar electronic properties, they should have very similar if not identical property values.

Therefore, I predict the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl to be:

-155.67144145

This prediction is based on the exact match in molecular composition with the example molecule, just with a different arrangement of the chlorine atoms on the ring, which likely wouldn't significantly affect this particular property.

True Property: 3450.161287923436
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecular structure and the given examples, I notice several patterns:

1. Larger, more complex molecules generally have higher positive values
2. Simple hydrocarbons and halogenated compounds often have values around -674.49
3. Molecules with multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (especially cyclic ethers, esters) tend to have higher positive values
4. The presence of complex ring systems with heteroatoms increases the value

The target molecule contains:
- Multiple methoxy groups (OC)
- A complex ring system
- Multiple oxygen-containing functional groups
- A sugar-like moiety
- Ester group
- Methylenedioxy group
- Multiple fused rings

Given these structural features and comparing with similar complex molecules in the training set (especially those with sugar-like portions and multiple oxygen-containing groups), I would predict a value around:

2450-2600, specifically approximately 2534.82

This prediction is based on the molecule's similarity to other complex, oxygen-rich structures in the training set, particularly those containing sugar-like moieties and multiple ring systems.

2. It has a thioether (CSc-) group
3. Contains a carbonyl group (c(=O))
4. Has a tert-butyl substituent (C(C)(C)C)

- Other heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen atoms tend to have values in the 1000-1200 range
- The presence of sulfur and nitrogen atoms in heterocycles appears to contribute to higher values

Based on these structural similarities and patterns, I would predict the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C to be approximately:

1115.32 ± 50

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to the compounds in the training set, particularly those containing nnc rings, sulfur atoms, and tert-butyl groups.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate, which contains:
- An aromatic ring (benzene)
- An ester group
- A short alkyl chain

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple hydrocarbons and halogenated compounds often have values around -674.49
2. Molecules with aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have values in the positive range
3. Esters in the training set (like CCCCCC(=O)OC and CCCCC(=O)OCC) have values of 0.0

Given that this molecule:
- Is more complex than simple esters
- Contains an aromatic ring
- Has an ester group
- Is smaller than many of the complex molecules with very high positive values

Based on these structural features and patterns, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.0 for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1.

This prediction takes into account that similar ester-containing molecules in the training set have this value, and while the presence of the aromatic ring might suggest a different value, the overall structural similarity to the simple esters in the training set seems to be the dominant factor.
