True Property: 0.3174205400536661
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the given examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester of a long-chain fatty acid (methyl decanoate).

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Longer carbon chains tend to increase the property value
2. Ester groups (C(=O)OC) contribute moderately to the property
3. Similar compound CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl dodecanoate) has a value of 0.96639036
4. The property generally increases with molecular size but not linearly
5. Oxygenated compounds with similar size have values around 0-1

Since this molecule is:
- Slightly shorter than the C12 ester example
- Has similar functional groups
- Similar overall structure

I would predict the property value to be approximately 0.78

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Lower than the C12 ester (0.96639036)
- Higher than most small molecules (-0.3 to -0.8)
- Consistent with the general trends seen in the dataset

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (isopropyl nitrite, CC(C)N(=O)=O) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitrite group
2. Contains branched aliphatic portion (isopropyl)
3. Has oxygen-containing functional group
4. Similar in size to some of the smaller molecules in the training set

3. Has multiple cyclic aliphatic rings
4. Contains multiple chiral centers
5. Similar structural features to some of the training examples, particularly the steroid-like molecule CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C which has a value of 4.96547058

Based on:
- The structural similarity to other complex polycyclic compounds in the training set

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.16515306600372284
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The target molecule (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) is biphenyl - two benzene rings connected directly to each other.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have negative values
2. Aromatic systems generally have higher values than aliphatic ones
3. More complex/larger aromatic systems have higher positive values
4. The presence of simple aromatic rings without additional functional groups tends to give values around 0 to 1

Specifically looking at similar structures:

- A CC=C group

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a value of -0.1675864
- This is the most similar structure, differing only by having a larger alkyl group

Key observations:
1. The core structure is identical to the example molecule
2. The main difference is the longer alkyl chain substituent
3. Both have the CC=C group
4. Longer alkyl chains tend to slightly increase the property value

Based on these patterns and considering:
- The similarity to the reference molecule
- The slight positive contribution of longer alkyl chains
- The maintained core structure

I predict the property value to be approximately: 0.15

True Property: 0.32081283360647717
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the target molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (which is fluorene), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1. The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with three fused rings
2. It's similar in structure to some of the examples containing fused aromatic rings
3. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
   - c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 (pentacene) has a value of 2.6845579
   - Other simpler aromatic compounds have lower values
   - The target molecule is smaller than pentacene but still has fused rings

Given these considerations and the general trend that:
- Simple aromatics tend to have values between -0.5 and 0.5
- Fused ring systems tend to have higher values
- The complexity and size of the molecule correlates with higher values
- The target molecule is more complex than benzene but less than pentacene

I would predict a value of approximately 0.85 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that fluorene is more complex than simple aromatics but less extensive than larger PAH systems in the training set, placing it in an intermediate range of values.

The target molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 has several key features:
1. Contains a sulfonamide group -S(=O)(=O)-
2. Has an aromatic ring (benzene)
3. Contains multiple nitrogen atoms including amino groups (-NH2)
4. Has a guanidine-like structure (-NC(=N)N-)

Taking all these factors into consideration, and noting that this molecule has both polar groups (which tend to decrease the value) and aromatic/complex structures (which tend to increase it), I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.92

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate size, polarity, and structural features while staying within the general range observed for similar compounds in the training set.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.758075511651288
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, a relatively simple ester.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Small molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have negative values
2. Esters generally show values between -0.4 and -0.6
3. Similar structures like CC(C)CCOC=O has a value of -0.57457121
4. The presence of branching (isopropyl group) tends to make values slightly less negative
5. Short chain esters are generally more negative than longer chain esters

Considering these patterns and comparing specifically to similar molecules in the training set, especially other esters and formates, I would predict the property value for CC(C)OC=O to be approximately:

True Property: -0.4107568534572039
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethyl phenol:
- It has a benzene ring as the core structure
- Contains two methyl (C) substituents
- Has one hydroxyl (O) group

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple phenol (c1ccccc1O) has a value of -0.64948127
- Methylated aromatics tend to increase the value slightly compared to unsubstituted variants
- The presence of hydroxyl groups generally keeps values in the negative or low positive range
- The molecule is relatively small and simple compared to many examples

Considering these factors and patterns:
1. It's structurally similar to phenol but with two methyl groups
2. The methylation would increase the value somewhat compared to plain phenol
3. It's still a relatively simple molecule with polar hydroxyl group

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.35

This prediction places it between simple phenol (-0.64948127) and more complex substituted aromatics, accounting for the effect of the methyl groups while maintaining the general influence of the hydroxyl group.

- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has value 1.89542039

The target molecule has the same basic organophosphate scaffold but with different substituents (SC and C instead of halogens). The methylthio group (SC) is generally less electronegative than halogens, and the methyl group is electron-donating.

Considering these factors and the trends in the training data, I predict the property value would be approximately:

1.45

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a similar base value to other organophosphates but slightly lower due to less electronegative substituents compared to the halogenated examples in the training set.

1. It's a biaryl system (two aromatic rings connected)
2. Contains 5 chlorine atoms
3. Has a similar structure to some of the training examples with multiple chlorine substitutions on aromatic rings

Looking at similar molecules from the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl atoms, biaryl) has value 3.15946739

- Slightly different chlorine arrangement pattern

Based on these comparisons and the general trends observed in the training set where:
- More chlorine atoms generally increase the value
- Biaryl systems tend to have values in the 2-4 range
- Similar structures have similar values

I predict the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl to be approximately:

2.85

This prediction places it slightly below the first reference compound (3.15946739) since it has fewer chlorines but maintains similar structural characteristics.

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. It has a short carbon chain (3 carbons)
3. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - Simple alkanes (CCC) have values around -0.85
   - Molecules with nitro groups (NO2) tend to increase the value
   - Small molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups generally have values between -0.8 and -0.2

- The size and complexity is relatively low
- Similar small molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups tend to be in the -0.7 to -0.4 range

Based on these considerations and patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCCN(=O)=O to be approximately:

-0.52

This takes into account both the structural features and the general trends observed in the training set while considering the relative impact of the nitro group on similar molecules.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobromobenzene, where fluorine and bromine are substituted on a benzene ring in different positions.

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of -0.36195593 (similar dihalogenated benzene)
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 derivatives have values around -0.39
- Brominated aromatics generally show values in the -0.3 to -0.4 range
- Fluorine substitutions typically lead to slightly less negative values compared to chlorine

Given that:

The target molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 has these key characteristics:
1. It's a bicyclic structure
2. Contains an OH group
3. Has multiple methyl substituents
4. Is relatively compact and saturated
5. Has moderate complexity but no aromatic rings

Looking at similar structures in the examples:
- Molecules with OH groups tend to have values around -0.5 to 0.5
- Bicyclic structures typically increase the value
- The presence of methyl groups tends to slightly increase the value
- Saturated ring systems without aromatics tend to have moderate positive values

The most similar molecules in the training set are:

However, our target molecule is significantly simpler than these examples, lacking the additional functional groups that drive their values higher.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.45

This takes into account the bicyclic nature, OH group, and methyl substituents while acknowledging its relative simplicity compared to the higher-value examples.

2. The main difference is the absence of the SC(CCl) group in our target molecule
3. It contains:
   - A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
   - Two ethoxy groups (OCC)
   - A phthalimide ring system
4. The overall structure suggests moderate lipophilicity

Considering these factors:
- The base structure similarity to the training example
- The removal of the SC(CCl) group would reduce the value somewhat
- The presence of the phosphorothioate and phthalimide groups still contributes significantly to the property

I would predict a value of approximately 4.8 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that removing the SC(CCl) group would reduce the value from 6.49, but the remaining structural features would still maintain a relatively high value for this property.

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCC(=O)OCC - ethyl hexanoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Longer chain aliphatic compounds tend to have values closer to 0 or slightly negative
2. Esters (compounds with C(=O)O group) generally have values in the -0.9 to 0.1 range
3. The length of the carbon chain affects the value, with longer chains increasing the value
4. This molecule is similar in structure to CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC which has a value of 0.07050244

1. This molecule is structurally very similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) from the training set, which has a value of -0.25116819
2. The only difference is that our target molecule has a methyl ester (COC(=O)-) instead of an ethyl ester (CCOC(=O)-)
3. Looking at other patterns in the training data:
   - Shorter chain lengths generally lead to slightly more negative values
   - Simple aromatic esters tend to have values in the negative range between -0.2 and -0.7

Given these considerations, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

2. It has an acetamide group (-NH(C=O)CH3)
3. The overall size and complexity is moderate
4. It contains both polar and nonpolar regions

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Fc1cccc(Br)c1 has a value of -0.50881932
- Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of -0.46239098
- Simple aromatics with polar substituents tend to have values between -0.4 and -0.6
- The acetamide group would likely make it slightly more polar than just a bromine substituent

Based on these patterns and the molecular features, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.42

This takes into account that the molecule should have a value:
- Less negative than simple alcohols/ethers
- Similar to but slightly less negative than brominated phenols
- More negative than larger, more lipophilic molecules
- In the range typical for medium-sized aromatic molecules with polar substituents

True Property: -0.15237322371852605
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the given examples.

The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is isobutylbenzene, which consists of:
- A benzene ring (c1ccccc1)
- An isobutyl group (CC(C)C-) attached to the benzene ring

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethyltoluene) has a value of -0.31572026
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (p-cymene) has a value of -0.1409037

The target molecule is most similar to these compounds, particularly the alkylated benzenes. It has:
- A slightly larger alkyl group than ethyltoluene
- Similar branching to p-cymene
- No additional substituents

Based on these structural similarities and the observed trends, I would predict the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 to be approximately:

-0.25

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The value should be negative (like most simple aromatic compounds in the dataset)
2. It should be in a similar range to other monosubstituted benzenes
3. The branched alkyl group would likely give it a value between ethyltoluene and p-cymene

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.5659957127655547
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple aromatic structures tend to have slightly negative values
2. The presence of oxygen generally contributes to more negative values
3. Small molecules with simple substituents tend to be in the negative range
4. The aldehyde group (C=O) appears to have a moderating effect compared to alcohols

Benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) has:
- A single benzene ring
- An aldehyde group directly attached
- Relatively simple structure
- Similar to some of the simpler aromatic examples

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- COc1ccccc1 (anisole) has -0.53730134
- Simple benzene derivatives tend to be in the -0.3 to -0.5 range
- The aldehyde group should have similar electronic effects to other oxygen-containing substituents

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict the property value for benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) to be approximately:

-0.48

This value takes into account the molecule's aromaticity, the electron-withdrawing effect of the aldehyde group, and its overall structural similarity to other examples in the training set.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.23643821418532576
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains a furan ring (5-membered oxygen heterocycle) with a nitro group
2. It has a cyclic urea structure (dihydropyrimidine-2,4-dione)
3. Contains a hydrazone linkage
4. Has multiple polar groups (C=O, NO2)
5. Contains both aromatic and non-aromatic components

Looking at the training examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups tend to have higher values
- Heterocyclic compounds with multiple heteroatoms typically have values around 0 to 2
- The presence of polar groups and moderate size suggests a middle-range value
- Similar sized molecules with comparable polarity are in the 0.5 to 1.5 range

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 to be approximately:

1.12

This prediction takes into account the molecule's structural features, polarity, and similarity to compounds in the training set.

Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.6759134648813833
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is a hydrazine derivative with two phenyl rings. Looking at similar structures in the training examples:

1. N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (azobenzene) has a value of 0.46656261
2. Simple aromatic amines like Nc1ccccc1 (aniline) has a value of -0.58904397
3. Diphenyl-containing structures generally have values around 2-3

The query molecule is very similar to azobenzene (N=N vs N-N), but the hydrazine linkage (N-N) would make it slightly more polar than the azo linkage (N=N). This would likely result in a value somewhere between azobenzene and aniline, but closer to azobenzene.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value would be approximately:

0.35

This value reflects that it should be:
- Slightly lower than azobenzene (0.46656261) due to increased polarity
- Higher than aniline (-0.58904397) due to the additional phenyl ring
- Lower than most biphenyl derivatives due to the polar linking group

1. It's a cyclic imide structure
2. Contains a cyclopentane ring fused to the imide
3. Has multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)
4. Relatively compact and symmetric structure
5. Contains no aromatic rings or halogens

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1 has value -0.00833625
- O=C1CCCN1 has value -0.75876146
- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC has value 0.56013958

The target molecule is most similar to these examples, particularly the last one, but is somewhat smaller and more symmetric. It has a similar number of carbonyls and nitrogen atoms, but lacks the longer alkyl chains.

Based on these structural similarities and trends, I predict the property value would be approximately:

0.15

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is more complex than the simple lactam (O=C1CCCN1) but less complex than the substituted barbiturate-like structure, placing it in an intermediate range of values.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has several key structural features:
1. It contains three chlorine atoms
2. It has two benzene rings connected directly (biphenyl structure)
3. The chlorines are distributed across both rings
4. It's a relatively lipophilic molecule due to the chlorine substituents

Looking at similar structures from the training examples:
- Clc1ccccc1Cl has a value of -0.44373403 (two chlorines, one ring)

- Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values around -0.4 to -0.6
- Adding chlorines and increasing molecular size tends to increase the value
- Biphenyl-like structures tend to have higher values

Based on these patterns and considering the molecule's similarity to the training examples, I predict the property value would be approximately:

1.85

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is larger than simple chlorobenzenes but smaller than the pentachlorinated biphenyl derivative in the training set, and considers the general trend that more complex aromatic structures with multiple halogens tend to have higher values in this property scale.
==================================================
Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.14374246343703334
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule (CCc1ccc(CC)cc1), which is a para-diethylbenzene, I can make a prediction based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at similar aromatic compounds in the training set:

Considering these factors:
1. It's less hydrophobic than heptylbenzene (which has a longer alkyl chain)
2. It's more hydrophobic than simple benzene derivatives
3. The symmetrical para substitution typically leads to moderate values

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 to be approximately:

0.15

This value reflects its moderate hydrophobicity and structural similarity to other alkylbenzenes in the training set, while accounting for its simpler structure compared to more complex molecules.

2. Has amino (-NH2) group similar to some negative value examples
3. Contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) which is polar
4. The overall structure is relatively small and has good water solubility
5. Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
   - Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a value of -0.41292253
   - Other simple aromatic compounds with polar groups tend to have negative values
   - The presence of sulfur and additional nitrogen makes it slightly more polar

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately:

Pyrene is smaller than these examples but follows the same pattern of fused aromatic rings. It's a symmetric, planar molecule with extended conjugation.

Based on these observations and the molecule's structural similarity to other PAHs in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

1. A phosphate group (P=O)
2. A methoxy group (COP)
3. An acetamido group (NC(C)=O)
4. A methylthio group (SC)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules containing phosphate groups (like CCN(CC)C(=O)C(=CCOP(=O)(OC)OC)Cl) tend to have values around 1.4-2.5
- Smaller molecules with similar functional groups tend to have lower values
- The presence of S and N atoms typically doesn't drastically increase the value
- Acetamido groups (like in CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1) tend to contribute moderately to the property

Considering these factors and the molecule's relatively small size compared to the higher-value examples, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.85

- Structurally similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl (but simpler)

Looking at patterns in the training data:
- Halogenated aromatics tend to have values between -0.4 and 1.0
- Simple dihalogenated benzenes show values around -0.4 to 0.8
- Bromine substituents typically give slightly higher values than chlorine
- The symmetrical para substitution pattern is similar to some examples

Considering these factors and comparing to similar structures in the training set, particularly the chlorinated aromatics, I would predict a property value of approximately:

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 3.159467388372846
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples and analyzing the given molecule, I notice several patterns:

1. The target molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure, similar to some of the examples with high values
2. It contains multiple chlorine substituents (6 Cl atoms) on a biphenyl core
3. The structure is similar to "Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" which has a value of 8.28247404

Key observations from the training examples:
- Molecules with multiple halogens (especially Cl) on aromatic systems tend to have high positive values

The target molecule appears to be a steroid-like structure with:
- A steroid core skeleton
- Two hydroxyl groups (O)
- One alkyne group (C#C)

- CCCCCC=O (hexanal): -0.60389361
- Simple esters and aldehydes generally have negative values
- The length of the carbon chain seems to have a moderate effect
- Oxygen-containing compounds with similar size tend to have values between -0.5 and -0.8

This molecule (butyl formate) is:
- Smaller than ethyl butyrate
- Has similar polarity due to the ester group
- Has a shorter chain than hexanal
- Contains similar functional groups to several training examples

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCCCOC=O to be approximately:

-0.63

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's an ester (like several training examples)
2. It has a moderate-length carbon chain
3. Its size and polarity are similar to other molecules with negative values in this range
4. It's slightly simpler than some similar compounds in the training set

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.8432213236303933
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1) Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- ClCCCl has a value of -0.77189319
- This is the most similar structure, just differing by one carbon

2) Key observations:
- Small molecules with halogens tend to have negative values
- The molecule in question is smaller than ClCCCl
- Symmetric dihalogenated compounds show similar patterns
- Short carbon chains with chlorine substituents generally have values in the -0.7 to -0.8 range

3) Considering the molecular features:
- It's a very small molecule
- Has two chlorine atoms
- Single carbon
- Symmetric structure
- More compact than ClCCCl

Based on these considerations, and particularly the close similarity to ClCCCl (-0.77189319), but accounting for the smaller size, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.78

This prediction takes into account that smaller halogenated molecules tend to have slightly more negative values in this property scale, while maintaining consistency with the patterns observed in the training set.

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.4107568534572039
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a dimethylphenol (two methyl groups on a phenol ring).

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (-0.07106284) - very similar, has methyl groups and OH
- Oc1cccc(O)c1 (-0.61363494) - phenol with different substitution
- CC(C)C(C)O (-0.68157899) - contains OH group but different structure

The target molecule has:
- A phenol (OH) group
- Two methyl substituents
- Similar overall size to some reference molecules
- Similar polarity profile to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O

Given that the most similar molecule (CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O) has a value of -0.07106284, and our target molecule is very similar in structure but slightly simpler, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The presence of OH group tends to give negative values
2. The methyl substituents slightly increase the value
3. The overall structure is very similar to the reference compound but with small differences in substitution pattern

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 1.757876726377673
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and the target molecule, I notice several patterns that can help predict the property value:

1. The target molecule contains multiple chlorine substituents (4 Cl atoms) and two connected benzene rings, making it similar to other polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the training set.

2. Looking at similar structures:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl) has value 3.15946739
- Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (5 Cl) has value 2.39065878

3. The target molecule has 4 Cl atoms, which is fewer than both reference molecules, but maintains the biphenyl core structure.

4. The property appears to increase with:
- Number of chlorine atoms
- Number of aromatic rings
- Overall molecular size

Based on these observations, I would predict the property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl to be approximately:

2.75

This prediction is made because:
- It should be lower than the 6-Cl compound (3.15946739)
- But higher than the simple chlorinated aromatics
- Similar to other multi-ring chlorinated structures
- Takes into account the biphenyl core contribution and the four chlorine substituents

2. Smaller molecules generally have values closer to zero or negative
3. Molecules with similar structural features (alkenes, methyl branches) show comparable values
4. The complexity and size of the molecule tends to correlate with higher positive values

For CC=C(C)C:
- It's a small hydrocarbon
- Contains one double bond
- Has branched methyl groups
- Similar in size/complexity to molecules like CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.14) but simpler
- More similar to molecules in the negative range of the dataset

Based on these observations and the molecule's structural features, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1. It's a very small molecule with just two carbons
2. It has two chlorine atoms
3. It's symmetric
4. It has no complex functional groups
5. Looking at similar simple halogenated compounds in the training set:
   - ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a value of -0.5986233
   - Other small chlorinated compounds tend to have negative values
   - Simple, small molecules generally have negative values in this dataset

Based on these observations, particularly comparing to similar small halogenated compounds and considering the general trend that simple, small molecules tend to have negative values in this dataset, I would predict the property value for ClCCl to be approximately:

-0.55

This prediction takes into account that it's simpler than ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl but has a similar basic structure with chlorine atoms, and follows the pattern of negative values for small, simple molecules in the dataset.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.223962118041008
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms at positions 2,4,6 and a hydroxyl group.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (2,4,6-trichlorophenol) has a value of -0.22396212
2. Other halogenated compounds like Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 has a value of 0.04790669

The target molecule is exactly the same as the first reference compound (just written in a slightly different SMILES notation), so it should have virtually the same property value.

Therefore, I predict the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl to be:

-0.22396

This prediction is made with high confidence since we have an exact structural match in the training set.

True Property: 37.72919578814975
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, looking at this complex molecule and the training examples, I can make several observations:

1. This is a large, complex natural product-like molecule with multiple ring systems, oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters, acetals), and a methylenedioxy group.

2. Looking at the training examples, I notice that:
- Larger, more complex molecules generally have higher values
- Molecules with multiple rings and oxygen-containing groups tend to have positive values
- The presence of conjugated systems increases the value
- Natural product-like structures (steroids, complex heterocycles) typically have values between 2-6

3. The target molecule has characteristics similar to some of the larger complex molecules in the training set, but with even more oxygen-containing groups and rings.

4. It's most similar in complexity to some of the steroid-like compounds in the training set, but with additional complexity and oxygen-containing groups.

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict a value of approximately 4.8 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account:
- The molecule's large size and complexity
- Multiple oxygen-containing functional groups
- The presence of multiple ring systems
- The similarity to natural product-like structures in the training set
- The presence of conjugated systems

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.45781361925295244
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, I notice:
1. It contains a heterocyclic ring structure with multiple nitrogen atoms
2. Has a thioether (CSc-) group
3. Contains a carbonyl group
4. Has a tert-butyl substituent (C(C)(C)C)
5. Has an amino substituent (-N)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a value of 1.07447582
- This is particularly relevant as it also contains an nnc ring system and a tert-butyl group
- Other heterocyclic compounds with similar complexity tend to have values between 0.5 and 1.5

Based on these observations and the structural similarities, I would predict a value of approximately 1.15 for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C.

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of the nnc ring system (contributing positively)
- The thioether group (slightly increasing the value)
- The tert-butyl group (contributing to stability and slightly increasing the value)
- The overall molecular size and complexity

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.25116818966184806
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ethyl benzoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple molecules tend to have negative values
2. Aromatic rings with substituents tend to have values around -0.5 to 0.5
3. The presence of ester groups (C(=O)O) tends to give values slightly negative
4. The size and complexity of the molecule affects the value

For CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate):
- It has an aromatic ring
- Contains an ethyl ester group
- Relatively simple structure
- Similar in complexity to some examples with values around -0.4 to 0.0

Considering these factors and comparing to similar structures in the training set, particularly other esters and aromatic compounds, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account that it's more complex than simple molecules but less complex than the highly positive valued molecules, and considers the presence of both the aromatic ring and ester group.

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.24553933275405307
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (1-bromoheptane) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple linear alkyl halides tend to have negative values
2. Longer carbon chains tend to increase the value slightly
3. Similar molecules like CCCCCCC=C (1-heptene) has a value of -0.36820754
4. The bromine substitution, based on examples like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, tends to increase the value slightly compared to other functional groups

Given that:
- This is a 7-carbon chain (heptyl) with a bromine
- It's similar in structure to CCCCCCC=C but with Br instead of =C
- The bromine typically has a less negative contribution than double bonds
- The length of the carbon chain will moderate the negative value

I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately:

-0.32

This prediction takes into account the molecule's linear structure, chain length, and the presence of the bromine atom, while considering the patterns seen in the training set.

- Has similar structural features to other small alcohols in the training set
- Is more polar than hydrocarbons but less complex than most examples

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict the property value for methanol (CO) to be approximately:

-0.82

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- More negative than larger alcohols
- Similar to other very simple molecules in the training set
- Slightly less negative than the simplest hydrocarbons shown
