SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.36534916138315576
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. Molecules with long aliphatic chains tend to have positive values
2. The presence of ester groups (C(=O)OC) typically gives values around 0.3-0.4
3. Similar molecule CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC has a value of 0.36534916

The target molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester with a 10-carbon chain, which is very similar to the example with a 12-carbon chain (CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC = 0.36534916).

Since the target molecule has a slightly shorter carbon chain but maintains the same functional group (methyl ester), I would expect the property value to be very similar, perhaps slightly lower but in the same range.

Based on these observations, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC to be approximately:

0.36534916

This prediction is based on the structural similarity to the 12-carbon analog and the consistent pattern seen with other ester-containing molecules in the dataset.

The target molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 has these key features:
1. A fused bicyclic system
2. Contains an oxazolone-like ring structure
3. Has a chlorine substituent
4. Contains NH and C=O groups

Considering these factors and comparing to the most similar structures in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.55 to -0.65

My specific prediction would be: -0.58

This takes into account the negative contribution from the heterocyclic system and NH/C=O groups, slightly offset by the chlorine substituent.

1. The molecule contains:
- Two fluorine atoms on a benzene ring
- A urea linkage (-NC(=O)NC(=O)-)
- A chlorine substituent on another benzene ring

2. Looking at similar patterns in the training set:

- Has no heteroatoms
- Less complex than most negative-valued examples

I would predict a value of approximately -0.25 for this molecule.

The target molecule is a barbiturate derivative with an unsaturated side chain. Looking at the training examples, I notice:

1. Similar cyclic structures with multiple C=O and N-H groups tend to have negative values
2. The most similar molecule in the training set is "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C" with value -0.68385869
3. The target molecule differs by having an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) instead of just methyl
4. Longer alkyl chains tend to make molecules slightly more positive in property value
5. The core barbiturate structure dominates the property

Given these observations, I would predict the property value to be approximately -0.65 to -0.70, with the slightly longer alkyl chain making it marginally more positive than the similar example molecule.

My specific prediction is: -0.66

This takes into account both the structural similarity to the known barbiturate example while accounting for the minor modification of the longer alkyl chain.

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.85

This value takes into account that it should be:
- Less negative than anthracene (-1.33)
- More negative than simple aromatics like Fc1cccc(F)c1 (0.0)
- Similar to other medium-sized aromatic systems in the training set

- The size and complexity is similar to molecules that have values in the -0.5 to -0.8 range

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately:

-0.65

This prediction takes into account the molecule's polarity, size, and structural features that align with patterns seen in the training data.

- More complex structures with multiple functional groups tend to be more negative
- Electron-withdrawing groups like NO2 and CF3 typically push towards more negative values
- The presence of nitrogen-containing groups often contributes to negative values

Based on these observations and the complexity of the molecule, with multiple electron-withdrawing groups, I would predict a value of approximately:

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.36534916138315576
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CC(C)OC=O is an isopropyl formate, which is a relatively simple ester.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple esters and compounds with C(=O)O groups tend to have values around 0.36-0.37
2. Specifically, CC(C)CCOC=O has a value of 0.36534916, which is structurally similar
3. Other simple molecules containing C=O groups tend to have values between 0.35-0.55
4. The molecule in question is smaller and simpler than CC(C)CCOC=O but has the same functional groups

Based on these observations, and particularly the strong similarity to CC(C)CCOC=O, I predict the property value for CC(C)OC=O would be:

0.36534916

Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.0562075632897162
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethyl phenol (two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a benzene ring).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values around -0.05 to 0.1
2. Phenol (c1ccccc1O) has a value of -0.05620756
3. Adding methyl groups to aromatic rings tends to make the value slightly more positive (as seen in examples like CCc1ccccc1C at 0.13115098)
4. The molecule is relatively simple and has some similarity to methylated aromatics in the training set

Given these observations, I would predict a value around -0.02 to 0.05, as it should be slightly more positive than phenol due to the two methyl groups, but still maintain the general characteristics of a substituted aromatic compound.

My specific prediction for this molecule would be: -0.02

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.8056417404859331
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The target molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has several key features:
1. It's an organophosphate compound with P=S group
2. Has methoxy groups (OC) attached to phosphorus
3. Contains an aromatic ring with methylthio (SC) and methyl (C) substituents

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has value 1.29277396
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has value 1.47076457
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has value 1.70496275

The target molecule has the same basic organophosphate skeleton but with different substituents on the aromatic ring (SC and C instead of Cl). The methylthio and methyl groups are generally less electronegative than halogens, which would likely result in a somewhat lower value than the chlorinated analogs.

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

1.15

This value is slightly lower than the chlorinated analogs but still positive due to the presence of the P=S group and similar overall structure.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.7588021044111695
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has several key characteristics:
1. It contains multiple chlorine atoms (5 Cl atoms)
2. It has a biphenyl-like structure (two benzene rings connected)
3. The chlorines are distributed across both rings

Looking at similar structures from the training set:
- ClC(Cl)Cl (three chlorines) has value 1.67685897
- Molecules with multiple chlorines on aromatic systems like Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl have values around 1.03047199
- More heavily chlorinated biphenyls like Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl have values around 1.30214188

The target molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than the highest value examples
- Similar biphenyl core structure
- Chlorine distribution pattern similar to the training examples

Based on these structural comparisons and the observed property values in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

1.15

This prediction places it between the less chlorinated and more chlorinated biphenyl examples, accounting for its intermediate level of chlorination while maintaining the core biphenyl structure.
==================================================
Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.2997736708784867
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O, propyl nitrite) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. Contains a short carbon chain (propyl)
3. Has oxygen-containing functional group
4. Similar in size to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- Simple alkanes (CCC) have values around 0.86
- Molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative values
- Small molecules with oxygen-containing groups tend to have values between 0.3 to -0.5
- The presence of N=O groups generally pulls the value towards the negative direction

Considering these patterns and the molecule's structure, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.13

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The base propyl chain would contribute positively (like CCC)
2. The nitro group would reduce this value significantly
3. The molecule is relatively small and simple
4. It's more polar than simple alkanes but less than complex nitro compounds

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.5152359968223991
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a benzene ring substituted with both fluorine and bromine atoms in different positions.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of 0.85248138 (dihalogenated benzene)
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 patterns show halogen substitutions affect the value
- Bromine-containing compounds generally show higher values than fluorine
- Aromatic compounds with halogens typically have values between 0.2 and 1.0

Considering that:
1. The molecule has both F and Br substituents
2. Bromine typically contributes more to the property than fluorine
3. The pattern of dihalogenated benzenes in the training set
4. The meta-substitution pattern (similar to some training examples)

I would predict a value of approximately 0.78 for Fc1cccc(Br)c1.

This prediction takes into account that the value should be:
- Lower than the Cl-Br benzene example (0.85248138)
- Higher than mono-halogenated benzenes
- Adjusted for the F vs Cl difference

True Property: 0.8243775949158385
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The target molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic structure with:
- A bridged bicyclic system
- One hydroxyl group (-OH)
- Several methyl substituents
- Mostly saturated carbons

2. Looking at patterns in the training examples:
- Molecules with similar size and complexity tend to have values between 0 and 1
- Presence of OH groups often leads to values around 0.8 (like in CCCC(C)(C)O, CC(C)(C)CO which both have 0.82437759)
- Bicyclic structures tend to moderate the values somewhat
- Fully saturated systems tend to have more positive values than aromatic ones

3. The closest structural analogues in the training set are:
- CC(C)(C)CO (0.82437759)
- CC1CCCO1 (0.82437759)
- Some of the steroid-like structures (which have values around 0.2 to -0.4)

Based on these considerations, I would predict a value of approximately 0.31850953 for this molecule. This takes into account:
- The presence of the OH group (pushing toward positive values)
- The bicyclic nature (moderating the highly positive values seen in simpler alcohols)
- The overall saturated nature of the system
- The relative complexity compared to the training examples
==================================================

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.14051890822429056
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value by comparing it to the training examples and considering structural similarities and patterns.

The target molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
- An imide ring system
- Aromatic ring
- Ethoxy groups

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O (0.45902843) is very similar, just missing the SC(CCl) portion
- Other molecules containing imide rings like O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1... tend to have negative values around -0.4 to -0.7
- Phosphorothioate containing compounds tend to be slightly positive

Given that:
1. The structure is most similar to the first example but slightly less lipophilic
2. It maintains the core imide structure
3. Has similar polarity characteristics

I would predict a property value of approximately -0.15

This takes into account that removing the SC(CCl) portion would likely decrease the positive value seen in the similar training compound (0.45902843) by about 0.6 units based on the patterns observed in other examples.

True Property: -0.7962738132709799
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my thought process:

1) The target molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a heterocyclic compound containing:
- A pyrazolone ring system
- A phenyl substituent
- Two methyl groups
- A carbonyl group

2) Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Compounds with fused ring systems and N-heterocycles tend to have negative values

- The presence of phenyl substituents generally pushes values toward the negative range
- Compounds with similar complexity and aromatic/heterocyclic nature tend to be in the -1.0 to -1.5 range

3) Most closely related examples from the training set:
- O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23 (-1.34898152)
- Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O (-1.40518908)

Based on these considerations and the structural similarities to known compounds, I predict the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C to be approximately:

-1.28

This prediction takes into account the molecule's heterocyclic nature, the presence of the carbonyl group, and its structural similarity to other compounds in the training set with comparable features.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.36534916138315576
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCC(=O)OCC - ethyl hexanoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Longer chain aliphatic compounds tend to have positive values
2. Esters (C(=O)OC pattern) typically have values around 0.3-0.4
3. The molecule contains similar structural elements to CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (which has 0.36534916)
4. It's less complex than many of the negative-valued examples which often contain aromatic or complex ring structures
5. The length of the carbon chain and the ester group suggests a moderate positive value

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, particularly other esters and aliphatic chains, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.42

This prediction takes into account that it's an ester (like examples showing ~0.36) but with a relatively long carbon chain (which tends to increase the value slightly based on the patterns in the training data).
==================================================
Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.36534916138315554
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples and analyzing the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1. This molecule is structurally very similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) which has a value of -0.36534916
2. The only difference is that our target molecule has a methyl ester (COC(=O)-) instead of an ethyl ester (CCOC(=O)-)
3. Generally, methyl esters have slightly higher values than their ethyl counterparts due to being slightly more polar
4. Looking at other aromatic esters in the dataset, they tend to have values in the negative range between -0.3 and -0.6

Based on these considerations, I would predict the property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 to be approximately:

-0.33

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Slightly higher (less negative) than the ethyl benzoate value (-0.36534916)
- In line with other aromatic esters in the dataset
- Reflective of its polarity and molecular size

Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. The property appears to be related to molecular polarity and hydrophobicity
2. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have positive values
3. Molecules with more complex structures and polar groups tend to have negative values
4. Linear, small hydrocarbons with unsaturation have values around 0.5-0.7

For C=CCC=C (1,4-pentadiene):
- It's a small hydrocarbon
- Has two double bonds
- Linear structure
- Similar in size and structure to CC/C=C/C (pent-2-ene) which has value 0.6182832
- Slightly more unsaturated than pent-2-ene
- No polar groups

Based on these observations and comparing with similar molecules in the training set, particularly CC/C=C/C (0.6182832), I would predict the property value for C=CCC=C to be approximately:

0.58

This prediction takes into account that the additional unsaturation might slightly lower the value compared to pent-2-ene, but the molecule maintains similar characteristics to other small, unsaturated hydrocarbons in the dataset.
==================================================

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 2.21083082272884
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (tribromomethane/bromoform) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Halogenated compounds (especially multiply halogenated) tend to have positive values
2. Small molecules with multiple halogens like FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br have values around 1.3-1.8
3. The more halogens present, generally the higher the value
4. Bromine-containing compounds like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 and Ic1cccc2ccccc12 show moderate positive values

For BrC(Br)Br (tribromomethane):
- It's a small molecule with three bromine atoms
- Similar in structure to other trihalomethanes
- More polarizable than chloroform due to bromine atoms
- Similar pattern to other multiply halogenated small molecules in the dataset

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for BrC(Br)Br to be approximately:

1.65

This prediction takes into account the size, number of halogens, and similarity to other halogenated compounds in the training set.

2. Has a chlorinated carbon (CCl)
3. Contains a phthalimide ring system
4. Has ethoxy groups (OCC)
5. Overall, it's a relatively large, complex molecule with both polar and nonpolar regions

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Molecules with chlorine typically have positive values
- Complex molecules with multiple ring systems tend to have negative values
- Molecules containing sulfur and phosphorus groups, especially in pesticide-like structures, tend to have values around 0.5 to 1.0
- The presence of imide groups (C(=O)NC(=O)) tends to push values negative

Considering all these factors and comparing to similar structures in the training set (especially COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 which has a value of 0.76817003), I would predict a value of approximately:

0.54 for this molecule

This prediction takes into account that while it shares some structural similarities with the phosphorothioate example, the phthalimide group would likely make it slightly more negative than that reference compound.

The target molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has:
- A diphenyl ether core structure
- Three chlorine substituents
- One hydroxyl group

- The presence of multiple chlorines tends to increase the value
- The hydroxyl group and ether linkage would slightly decrease the value compared to purely chlorinated compounds

Considering these factors and the overall molecular structure, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.25

This prediction takes into account:
1. The size and complexity of the molecule
2. The presence of three chlorines (which would increase the value)
3. The moderating effect of the hydroxyl and ether groups
4. The similarity to other chlorinated aromatic compounds in the training set
==================================================
Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.6182831961868789
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I notice this molecule is a geometric isomer (Z-isomer) of CC/C=C/C (which was given in the examples with value 0.6182832). The molecule in question is pent-2-ene, but with Z (cis) configuration instead of E (trans) configuration shown in the examples.

In general, Z-isomers tend to have slightly different physical properties compared to their E-counterparts, but the difference is usually small. Given that the E-isomer has a value of 0.6182832, and considering the general trend that Z-isomers often have values close to but slightly different from their E-counterparts, I would predict the property value for CC/C=C\C to be approximately:

0.59 to 0.62

My best specific prediction would be: 0.60

This prediction takes into account:
1. The structural similarity to the E-isomer
2. The typical small differences between geometric isomers
3. The general range of values seen in the training set for similar-sized hydrocarbons
4. The presence of the alkene functionality

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCOCC - ethyl propyl ether) by comparing it with the training examples and looking for patterns in molecular structure and corresponding property values.

Key observations:
1. The molecule is a relatively simple aliphatic ether
2. It has a moderate chain length
3. Similar molecules in the training set:
   - Simple aliphatic molecules tend to have values between 0.4-0.9
   - Oxygenated compounds generally show lower values than pure hydrocarbons
   - The presence of an ether linkage typically reduces the value compared to pure alkanes

Looking at some relevant comparisons:
- C1CCCCCC1 (cycloheptane): 0.8618493
- CCCCCCC=C (1-octene): 0.6182832
- CC(C)COC(=O)C (isobutyl acetate): 0.36534916

Considering these factors:
1. The base hydrocarbon structure would suggest a value around 0.8
2. The ether linkage will reduce this value
3. The molecule's size and branching pattern is moderate

Based on these considerations and patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCCOCC to be approximately:

0.52

This prediction takes into account that the ether linkage will reduce the value from what would be expected for a pure hydrocarbon, but the molecule retains some hydrophobic character from its alkyl chains.

- The substitution pattern and overall complexity is comparable to molecules with values between -0.8 and -1.4

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 to be approximately:

True Property: 0.13115098100933803
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the given examples.

The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is isobutylbenzene, which consists of:
- A benzene ring (c1ccccc1)
- An isobutyl group (CC(C)C-) attached to the benzene ring

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethyltoluene) has a value of 0.13115098
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (p-cymene) has a value of 0.13115098
- C=Cc1ccccc1 (styrene) has a value of -0.11241513
- Simple alkylbenzenes tend to have values around 0.1 to 0.3

The target molecule is most similar to these alkylbenzened derivatives, particularly the first two examples. The isobutyl group is slightly larger than the ethyl group but maintains similar chemical properties.

Based on these patterns and the molecule's structural features, I predict the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 to be approximately:

0.15 (±0.05)

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's an alkylbenzene like the reference compounds
2. The branched alkyl group will slightly increase the value compared to linear alkyl benzenes
3. The absence of additional substituents keeps it in a similar range to the simpler examples

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.1779906170841014
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde) and predict its property value by comparing it with the given examples and considering structural similarities and patterns.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values between -0.6 and 0.0
2. The presence of oxygen-containing groups (especially C=O) tends to decrease the value
3. Simpler structures with similar features include:
   - COc1ccccc1 (anisole) = -0.05620756
   - NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (salicylamide) = -0.55270771

Benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) has:
- A single benzene ring
- An aldehyde group (C=O)
- Similar complexity to anisole but with a more polar group

Considering these factors and the patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value for benzaldehyde to be approximately:

-0.15

This value takes into account that:
1. It's more polar than anisole but less polar than salicylamide
2. It has a simple aromatic structure
3. It contains a carbonyl group which typically reduces the value
4. It's relatively small and simple compared to many of the training examples

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -1.6768589714765347
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my reasoning:

1. The molecule contains a furan ring (5-membered oxygen heterocycle) with a nitro group
2. It has a cyclic urea structure (dihydropyrimidine-2,4-dione)
3. Contains a hydrazone linkage
4. Has multiple electron-withdrawing groups (nitro, carbonyl)
5. Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
   - Molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative values
   - Heterocyclic compounds with multiple heteroatoms typically show negative values
   - Compounds with similar complexity and polar groups show values between -0.5 and -1.5

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, particularly considering:
- The presence of multiple polar groups
- The heterocyclic nature
- The overall molecular complexity
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups

I would predict a property value of approximately -0.85 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that similar complex heterocyclic structures with multiple polar groups in the training set tend to have values in this range, and the presence of the nitro group and multiple carbonyl groups would contribute to a negative value in this approximate range.

Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.9742644303550811
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. Molecules with similar structural features tend to have similar property values
2. The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is very similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training set, which has a value of -0.97426443
3. The only difference is that our target molecule has an NH linkage instead of a N=N linkage
4. Generally, reducing a double bond to a single bond with additional hydrogens tends to make small changes to the property
5. Looking at other aromatic compounds in the dataset with similar size and conjugation, most values fall in the negative range between -0.5 and -1.5

Given that the target molecule is nearly identical to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (-0.97426443), with just a reduction of the N=N to N-N, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.95

This prediction takes into account that the structural change is minor and should not dramatically affect the property value compared to the very similar reference compound.

True Property: -0.4402925791027773
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 has several key features:
1. It's a cyclic imide structure
2. Contains multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)
3. Has a cyclopentane ring fused to the imide
4. Relatively compact and symmetric structure
5. Contains nitrogen atoms in a cyclic arrangement

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1 has a value of -0.31850953
- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC has a value of -0.44029258
- O=C1CCCN1 has a value of 0.36534916

The target molecule is most similar to these structures, particularly the cyclic imides with multiple C=O groups. It's more complex than O=C1CCCN1 but simpler than O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC.

Based on these comparisons and the general trends in the dataset, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.42

This prediction takes into account that more complex cyclic structures with multiple C=O and N atoms tend to have negative values in this range, and the structural similarity to the reference compounds suggests a value between -0.3 and -0.5.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.2154623259439123
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has these key characteristics:
1. Contains three chlorine atoms
2. Has two connected benzene rings (biphenyl-like structure)
3. All chlorines are directly attached to aromatic rings
4. Relatively hydrophobic structure

Looking at similar molecules from the examples:
- Clc1ccccc1Cl (dichlorobenzene) has value 0.67449076
- Molecules with multiple chlorines tend to have positive values
- Biphenyl-like structures tend to have values around 0.7-1.0
- Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has value 0.7588021

Given these patterns, and considering that:
- The target molecule has one more chlorine than dichlorobenzene
- It's less complex than the pentachlorinated biphenyl derivative
- The chlorines are well-distributed on both rings

I predict the property value would be approximately 0.72

This value takes into account the structural similarity to the reference molecules while considering the additional chlorine's contribution to the overall property.

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.13115098100933803
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict the property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a para-diethylbenzene (a benzene ring with two ethyl groups in para position).

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCCCCCc1ccccc1 (alkyl benzene) has value 0.13115098
- Cc1ccccc1N (toluidine) has value -0.05620756
- Simple aromatic compounds with alkyl substituents tend to have values close to 0, slightly positive

The target molecule is less lipophilic than CCCCCCc1ccccc1 (which has a longer alkyl chain), but more lipophilic than Cc1ccccc1N (which has an amino group).

The symmetrical nature of the para substitution and the presence of two ethyl groups (rather than longer alkyl chains) suggests a value that would be between these reference compounds, but closer to the positive range.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 to be approximately:

0.09

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -0.14051890822429056
Predicted Property:

Looking at the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O (Sulfanilamide), I notice:
1. It contains a sulfonamide group (-S(N)(=O)=O)
2. It has an aniline structure (aromatic ring with NH2)
3. The substituents are polar groups
4. It's relatively small and has good water solubility
5. It has similar polarity characteristics to some of the training examples with nitro groups

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a value of -0.6182832
- Other molecules with polar groups on benzene rings tend to have negative values
- Molecules with NH2 groups often have negative values
- The sulfonamide group would contribute similarly to a nitro group in terms of electronic effects

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict a value of approximately -0.65 for this molecule. This takes into account:
- The structural similarity to the nitroaniline example
- The presence of polar groups
- The overall molecular size and composition
- The balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic portions

Therefore, my predicted value is: -0.65

- c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 (value: -1.57381177)

2. Key observations:
- PAH structures generally have negative values
- The more complex/larger PAH systems tend to have more negative values
- The target molecule (pyrene) is simpler than some of the example PAHs
- The structure is very similar to these reference compounds but without any substituents

Based on these patterns, and considering that pyrene is a four-ring system that's smaller than some of the reference PAHs but still relatively complex, I would predict a value of approximately:

-1.20

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Negative (like other PAHs)
- Less negative than the larger PAH systems
- More negative than simpler aromatic structures
- In the general range of similar PAH structures from the training set

Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CCCCC(C)O is a branched primary alcohol with 6 carbons (hexanol with a methyl branch).

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCCC(O)CCC (heptanol) has a value of 0.82437759
- CCC(C)CCO (branched hexanol) has a value of 0.82437759
- CCC(CC)CO (another branched hexanol) has a value of 0.82437759

1. All similar alcohols with 6-7 carbons have very similar values
2. The branching pattern doesn't seem to significantly affect the value for these alcohols
3. The presence of the OH group and similar carbon chain length appears to be the dominant factor

Given that multiple similar alcohols in the training set have exactly the same value of 0.82437759, and our target molecule CCCCC(C)O is very similar in structure (same functional group, similar carbon count, similar branching pattern), I predict that its value would also be:

0.82437759

This prediction is made with high confidence due to the consistent pattern seen in similar molecules in the training set.

- The molecule lacks additional functional groups that might significantly alter the property

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 to be approximately:

0.42

This prediction takes into account that the property value should be between the values seen for similar dihalogenated aromatics, but adjusted for the presence of bromine instead of chlorine.

Looking at the given examples and the target molecule, I notice this is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure, similar to some of the examples provided. Let me analyze the patterns:

1. The molecule contains multiple chlorine substituents (6 Cl atoms) on a biphenyl core structure
2. Looking at similar structures in the training set, particularly:
   - Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (which has a value of 2.11715155)
   - This is also a polychlorinated biphenyl but with more chlorines (10 Cl atoms)

3. Other patterns I observe:
   - Chlorinated compounds generally have higher positive values
   - Aromatic systems with multiple halogens tend to have values above 1.5
   - The fewer chlorines, the lower the value compared to more chlorinated analogues

Based on these observations, and considering that our target molecule has 6 chlorines (compared to 10 in the similar example), I would predict a value of approximately:

1.87432

This value is slightly lower than the 10-chlorine PCB example (2.11715155) because it has fewer chlorines, but still maintains a high positive value due to the significant chlorination of the biphenyl system.

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: -1.6768589714765338
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my thought process:

1) The target molecule is an organophosphate compound with three aromatic rings connected through phosphate ester linkages.

2) Looking at the patterns in the training data:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have negative values
- Phosphate/phosphorothioate containing compounds tend to have values ranging from moderately negative to positive
- The presence of methyl substituents on aromatic rings tends to make values less negative
- Compounds with P=O groups generally have lower values than P=S groups

3) Similar compounds in the training set:
- CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC has 2.05157606
- But this has P=S and aliphatic groups, unlike our target
- The aromatic compounds with multiple rings generally have values between -0.5 to -1.5

4) Considering:
- The three aromatic rings would push towards a negative value
- The P=O group would contribute to a moderately negative value
- The methyl substituents would make it slightly less negative
- The overall size and complexity is moderate

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.85

This prediction takes into account the structural features and their likely contributions to the property based on the training examples provided.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -0.018735854429905434
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, I notice:

1. It contains a trifluoromethyl group (CF3)
2. Has a benzene ring
3. Contains a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring with a ketone
4. Has two chlorine atoms
5. Overall structure suggests moderate lipophilicity

Analyzing similar structures from the examples:
- Molecules with halogen substituents (Cl, F) typically have values between -1.0 and 1.0
- Presence of aromatic rings with polar substituents tends to decrease the value
- N-containing heterocycles with carbonyls generally push towards negative values
- Multiple halogens typically increase the value slightly

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.75

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate complexity, the presence of both polar and nonpolar regions, and the general trends observed in the training set for similar structural features.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6182831961868788
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is a nitrobenzene derivative with a methoxy substituent.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a value of -0.99300028 (dinitrobenzene)
2. Simple aromatic compounds like Cc1cccc(C)c1 have values around 0.13115098
3. Molecules with nitro groups generally show negative values
4. The methoxy group (COc1) typically makes the molecule slightly more negative in property compared to unsubstituted analogs

Considering these patterns:
- The presence of one nitro group (instead of two) would make it less negative than dinitrobenzene
- The methoxy group would contribute to a slightly more negative value
- The overall structure is similar to nitrobenzene derivatives

Based on these considerations, I would predict a value of approximately -0.65 for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O.

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a negative value (due to the nitro group), but not as negative as the dinitrobenzene example, while also considering the effect of the methoxy substituent.

True Property: 2.7916423100559076
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples. Let me break down my reasoning:

1. The given molecule is highly chlorinated, containing multiple chlorine atoms
2. It has a complex cyclic structure
3. Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
   - Highly chlorinated compounds tend to have high positive values
   - ClCCCl has a value of 1.40518908
   - The hexachlorocyclohexane derivative has a value of 2.49186864
   - BrC(Br)Br has a value of 2.21083082

Given that this molecule:
- Has multiple chlorine atoms (more than the examples)
- Has a complex cyclic structure
- Is highly halogenated
- Shows structural similarity to some of the highest-value compounds in the training set

I would predict a property value of approximately 2.35

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is highly chlorinated like the hexachlorocyclohexane example (which had 2.49), but has a slightly different structural arrangement. The value should be in the higher positive range but slightly lower than the hexachlorocyclohexane example due to its specific structural constraints.

3. Has oxygen atoms in an ester arrangement
4. Similar in size and functionality to some simpler molecules in the training set

Looking at related molecules in the training set:
- Simple alkyl chains tend to have positive values
- Presence of oxygen typically reduces the value compared to pure hydrocarbons
- Esters generally show moderate values
- Small molecules with similar polarity tend to have values between 0 and 1

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.48

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's more polar than pure hydrocarbons (which have higher values)
- It's less polar than alcohols
- The short chain length and ester group would place it in a moderate range
- Similar sized molecules in the training set tend to have values in this range

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.36534916138315576
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

This molecule is a linear ester with a long alkyl chain (10 carbons) and an ethyl group on the ester oxygen.

Key observations from the training set:
1. Longer alkyl chains tend to give positive values (e.g., CCCCC(CC)C=O at 0.55270771)
2. Simple aliphatic compounds generally have positive values
3. Esters typically have values in the moderate range
4. The presence of oxygen atoms slightly reduces the value compared to pure hydrocarbons
5. Linear molecules with similar length like CCCCCCCCCC appear to have values around 0.5-1.0

Considering these factors:
- The long alkyl chain pushes the value up (similar to other alkanes in the training set)
- The ester group (C(=O)O) will slightly decrease the value
- The overall molecule is still primarily aliphatic
- The length and branching pattern suggests a moderate positive value

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.68

This prediction takes into account the molecule's similarity to other long-chain aliphatic compounds while accounting for the slight reducing effect of the ester group.

The target molecule has several key characteristics:
1. It's a large, symmetric molecule
2. Contains phosphorothioate groups (P=S)
3. Contains methoxy groups (OC)
4. Has a sulfur bridge between aromatic rings

True Property: -0.6182831961868788
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is a nitrophenol, specifically 3-nitrophenol (or m-nitrophenol).

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Similar nitro compounds like "Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O" has a value of -0.43092465
2. Phenols like "Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1" has a value of -0.05620756
3. The presence of nitro groups generally seems to make the values more negative
4. Substituted aromatics with polar groups tend to have values in the negative range

Considering these factors:
- The molecule combines both a hydroxyl (-OH) and nitro (-NO2) group on a benzene ring
- It's similar in structure to nitrotoluene but with -OH instead of -CH3
- The meta substitution pattern will have its own electronic effects
- Both substituents are electron-withdrawing groups

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.48

This value is slightly more negative than the nitrotoluene example because the hydroxyl group is more electron-withdrawing than a methyl group, but still in a similar range for substituted aromatic compounds with these types of functional groups.

- The presence of multiple oxygen atoms and hydroxyl groups typically reduces the value

3. The target molecule has:
- Multiple sugar-like rings
- Many hydroxyl groups
- Complex ether linkages
- Is significantly larger than most training examples
- Has structural similarity to polysaccharides

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict a value around -0.45 to -0.55 for this molecule. 

My specific prediction would be: -0.51

This takes into account both the structural similarity to simple sugars (which have positive values) but adjusts downward significantly due to the complexity, size, and multiple polar groups present in the molecule.

- Presence of aromatic rings tends to lower the value
- Presence of nitrogen heterocycles tends to lower the value
- Hydroxyl groups tend to moderate the value
- Complex 3D structures with multiple rings tend to have values in the negative range

Considering these factors:
- The presence of two chlorines would push the value up (but not as much as molecules with 3-4 chlorines)
- The three ring systems and nitrogen atoms would push the value down
- The hydroxyl group would moderate the overall value
- The overall complexity is similar to some of the negative-valued examples

Based on these considerations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.85

This prediction takes into account the balance between the electron-withdrawing chlorines and the electronic effects of the aromatic systems and heteroatoms.

- It's a very small molecule with two chlorine atoms
- It's symmetric
- It has similar polarity to ClCCCl
- It's slightly more compact than ClCCCl

Based on these observations and the general trends in the training data, I would predict the property value for ClCCl to be approximately 1.35

This prediction takes into account that:
- The value should be positive and relatively high (like other small halogenated compounds)
- It should be slightly lower than ClCCCl due to smaller size
- The presence of two chlorines suggests a significant contribution to the property

Therefore, my predicted value is: 1.35

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.05620756328971609
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a dimethylphenol (two methyl groups on a phenol ring).

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (-0.05620756) - Very similar, has methyl groups and OH
2. Oc1cccc(O)c1 (-0.24356611) - Phenol with different substitution
3. c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC (-0.24356611) - More complex phenol derivative

The target molecule is most similar to the first example, CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, which has a value of -0.05620756. The main difference is just in the position of the methyl groups.

Given the structural similarity and considering that the positioning of the methyl groups would have a minor effect on this property, I would predict a value very close to -0.05620756.

My prediction for Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be approximately -0.06

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.4871322151775409
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 4 chlorine atoms. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl atoms) has value 1.03047199
2. Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (5 Cl atoms) has value 0.7588021
3. Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl (4 Cl atoms) has value 1.03047199

The target molecule has:
- 4 chlorine atoms (like the third example)
- Biphenyl core structure (like examples 1 and 2)
- No other functional groups

Based on these structural similarities and the observed pattern that chlorinated aromatics tend to have positive values in the range of 0.75-1.05, and considering that this molecule has 4 chlorines (less than example 1 but similar to example 3), I would predict a value of approximately:

0.91 (±0.05)

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a value:
- Lower than the 6-chloro derivative
- Higher than the non-chlorinated aromatics
- Similar to other tetra-chlorinated structures

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.6182831961868789
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is 2-methylbut-2-ene, a relatively simple branched alkene.

Looking at the patterns in the training set:
1. Small, simple hydrocarbons tend to have positive values
2. Alkenes generally have values around 0.5-0.6
3. Branched structures with similar size have values in the 0.1-0.6 range
4. The molecule is similar in complexity to molecules like CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (0.13115098) but simpler

Given these observations and considering that this is:
- A small molecule
- Contains a double bond
- Has branching
- Is purely hydrocarbon
- Has similar structural complexity to some reference molecules

I would predict a property value of approximately 0.48

This prediction takes into account that it's simpler than aromatic compounds but more complex than linear alkanes, and considers the presence of the double bond and methyl branches.

Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1.4051890822429063
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a very small molecule with just two carbons
2. It contains two chlorine atoms
3. It's symmetric
4. It's similar in some ways to other chlorinated compounds in the training set

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
- Highly chlorinated molecules tend to have positive values
- Simple, small chlorinated molecules generally have positive values
- Molecules like ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl have a value around 1.70
- The more complex chlorinated compounds have even higher values (2+)

However, ClCCl is simpler and smaller than most examples in the training set. It should have a positive value due to its chlorine content, but lower than the more complex chlorinated compounds.

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately:

1.15

This prediction places it:
- Higher than simple aromatic compounds
- Lower than complex polychlorinated compounds
- In a reasonable range for a simple chlorinated molecule
- Consistent with the general trend that chlorinated compounds tend to have positive values in this property system

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.7588021044111695
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (very similar, also a trichlorophenol) has a value of 0.7588021
2. Other halogenated compounds like Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 have higher values (1.4801325)
3. ClCC and other simple chlorinated compounds have values around 1.13-1.40

The target molecule is most similar to the first reference compound (Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl = 0.7588021), with just a slight difference in the position of chlorine atoms. Given that they share:
- Same number of chlorine atoms
- Same phenol core structure
- Similar substitution pattern

I would predict the property value to be very close to 0.7588021, with only minor variation due to the slightly different substitution pattern.

Therefore, I predict the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl to be approximately 0.76

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -2.2576704588036023
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this complex molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my reasoning:

1. The molecule is a large, complex natural product-like structure with:
- Multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters)
- Aromatic rings
- Complex ring systems
- Multiple stereogenic centers
- Hydroxyl groups
- A methylenedioxy group (OCO)

2. Looking at the patterns in the training data:
- Larger, more complex molecules tend to have more negative values
- Molecules with multiple oxygen-containing groups tend to be more negative
- Natural product-like structures with multiple rings tend to have values between -0.5 and -2.0
- The presence of aromatic rings with oxygen substituents contributes to negative values

3. This molecule shares structural similarities with some of the more complex examples in the training set, particularly those with multiple rings and oxygen-containing functional groups.

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-1.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, and its similarity to other complex natural product-like structures in the training set.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.1124151265794324
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, I notice:

1. It contains a heterocyclic ring structure with multiple nitrogen atoms
2. Has a thioether (CSc-) group
3. Contains a carbonyl group (c(=O))
4. Has a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)
5. Contains an amino substituent (-N)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen typically have negative values
- The presence of sulfur-containing groups tends to give values around -0.2 to 0.7
- Molecules with similar complexity and polarity tend to have moderately negative values
- The tert-butyl group is similar to what's seen in CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C (-0.27166989)

Considering all these factors and the overall structural similarity to some of the training examples, particularly the one containing the nnc and tert-butyl groups, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.32

This prediction takes into account the molecule's polarity, size, and structural features while considering the trends observed in the training set.

Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.36534916138315554
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate:
- It contains a benzene ring (c1ccccc1)
- Has an ester group (-C(=O)OC-)
- Has an ethyl group (CC-)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values around -0.4 to 0.1
- Esters (like CCCCCC(=O)OC) have values around 0.36
- The presence of C(=O) groups often reduces the value somewhat
- Compounds with similar complexity and functional groups tend to be slightly negative to slightly positive

Considering these patterns and the overall molecular structure, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.11

This prediction takes into account:
1. The aromatic nature of the molecule
2. The ester functionality
3. The relatively small size
4. The balance between polar and nonpolar regions

This value places it in a reasonable range compared to similar molecules in the training set, accounting for both its aromatic character and its ester functionality.

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 1.3115098100933793
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (1-bromoheptane, CCCCCCCBr) by comparing it with the given examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a straight-chain alkyl bromide
2. Has 7 carbons in the main chain
3. Similar to other halogenated alkanes in the training set
4. Relatively non-polar structure
5. Similar molecular weight range to some examples

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- CI (iodoethane) has a value of 1.54570799
- Simple halogenated compounds tend to have positive values
- Longer chain alkanes/alkyl halides generally show values between 0.5-1.5
- The molecule has similar lipophilicity to some of the medium-length alkyl chains in the examples

Based on these observations and patterns, particularly considering the relationship between chain length and property values seen in the examples, I would predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately:

0.89

This prediction takes into account that brominated compounds typically have values slightly lower than iodinated ones, and the longer carbon chain would moderate the effect of the halogen somewhat compared to shorter chain halides.

Given that methanol (CO) is:
- A very simple molecule
- Contains an alcohol group (-OH)
- Smaller than most examples given
- Similar to other simple alcohols in the set

I would predict the property value to be approximately 0.82437759

This prediction is based on the patterns observed in similar molecules, particularly other simple alcohols in the training set, while accounting for methanol's smaller size and simpler structure.
