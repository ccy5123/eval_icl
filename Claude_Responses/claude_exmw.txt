SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.04991592522472173
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:
1. Longer carbon chains tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. The presence of oxygen atoms (especially esters) tends to slightly increase the value
3. The molecule in question (CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC) is a methyl ester with a long alkyl chain (methyl decanoate)
4. Similar structures in the training set include CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC which has a value of 0.4482295

Given that the target molecule:
- Is slightly shorter than the similar example molecule (10 carbons vs 12)
- Has the same functional group (methyl ester)
- Has similar polarity characteristics

I would predict a value of approximately 0.35

This prediction takes into account that:
- The slightly shorter chain length would likely decrease the value somewhat compared to the C12 example
- The ester group contributes to a positive value
- The overall molecular structure suggests moderate lipophilicity

Therefore, my predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is 0.35

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7312084191401347
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (isopropyl nitrite, CC(C)N(=O)=O) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple aliphatic molecules tend to have negative values
2. Molecules with nitro/nitroso groups tend to have values close to 0 or slightly negative
3. The complexity and size of the molecule affects the value
4. Presence of aromatic rings generally increases the value
5. Highly oxygenated molecules tend to have more negative values

For CC(C)N(=O)=O:
- It's a relatively simple aliphatic molecule
- Contains a nitroso group (N(=O)=O)
- Similar in size to molecules like CCCOCC (-0.73577273)
- No aromatic rings
- Has some oxygen content

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I predict the property value would be approximately:

Key observations:
1. The molecule has structural similarity to the steroid example in the training set
2. It contains similar functional groups (ketone, hydroxyl)
3. The overall size and complexity is comparable
4. The polarity and functional group distribution is similar

Based on these factors and comparing with the training examples, particularly the similar steroid structure, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

3.05

This prediction is based on:
- The structural similarity to the steroid example (3.1755749)
- Slightly lower value due to the additional hydroxyl group which typically reduces this property
- The presence of similar ketone functionalities
- The overall molecular size and complexity being comparable to other examples with values in this range

True Property: 1.404952570165481
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O has several key features:
1. A heterocyclic ring structure with two nitrogen atoms
2. Two carbonyl groups (C=O)
3. A bromine substituent
4. Alkyl groups (ethyl and methyl)
5. Medium-sized molecule with moderate complexity

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with bromine typically have values around 0.4-0.5 (e.g., CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, 0.4435867)
- Heterocyclic structures with nitrogen tend to have values between 0-2
- The presence of carbonyl groups slightly increases the value
- Medium-sized molecules with moderate complexity typically have values in the 1-3 range

Taking all these factors into consideration, and noting that this molecule has some similarity to other heterocyclic compounds in the training set but with additional complexity from the bromine and carbonyls, I would predict a property value of approximately:

1.82

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate size, presence of bromine, heterocyclic nature, and overall structural complexity while staying within the general range observed for similar compounds in the training set.

Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.29153619796287206
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The molecule "c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2" is biphenyl, which consists of two benzene rings connected directly to each other.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have negative values
2. Aromatic systems generally have values closer to 0 or slightly positive
3. More complex fused ring systems tend to have higher positive values
4. The presence of simple aromatic rings without additional functional groups tends to give values in the -0.5 to 0.5 range

Biphenyl is:
- More complex than a single benzene ring
- Simpler than fused ring systems like naphthalene
- A purely aromatic hydrocarbon without functional groups
- Similar in complexity to some of the simpler aromatic compounds in the training set

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.23

This prediction takes into account that biphenyl is more complex than simple hydrocarbons (which have more negative values) but simpler than the more complex aromatic systems (which have more positive values) in the training set.
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.7258520271613275
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCS - butanethiol) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1) It's a relatively small, linear molecule
2) Contains a sulfur atom at the terminus
3) Has a short alkyl chain (4 carbons)
4) No complex functional groups, rings, or aromatic systems

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- Simple linear alkanes tend to have negative values around -0.5 to -0.7
- The presence of heteroatoms (like S) tends to slightly increase the value
- Shorter chains generally have values closer to zero than longer chains
- Similar simple structures in the training set mostly have negative values

Considering these patterns and the molecule's characteristics, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.55

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's similar to linear alkanes but with a sulfur
- It's shorter than many of the negative-valued alkanes in the training set
- The sulfur would likely increase the value slightly compared to the pure hydrocarbon
- The overall simplicity of the molecule suggests a moderate negative value

Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.5807751786649383
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCC(C)(C)CO) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO:
1. It's an alcohol with a branched carbon chain
2. Contains a hydroxyl group (-OH)
3. Has similar structural elements to some training examples like:
- CCCC(C)(C)C (value: -0.74517485)
- CC(C)CC(C)O (value: -0.66349308)
- CCCC(C)(O)CC (value: -0.58077518)

Analyzing these similar structures:
- The presence of OH group tends to make the value less negative compared to pure hydrocarbons
- Branching with geminal dimethyl groups (C(C)(C)) appears in several examples
- The chain length and branching pattern influences the value

Based on these observations and the trends in the training data, I would predict the property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO to be approximately:

-0.62

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It should be more negative than CCCC(C)(O)CC (-0.58) due to different branching
2. Less negative than CCCC(C)(C)C (-0.74) due to the OH group
3. Similar to CC(C)CC(C)O (-0.66) but slightly less negative due to the additional branching

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.39459271011519165
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to make a prediction.

The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is methylnaphthalene, which consists of:
- A naphthalene core (two fused benzene rings)
- A methyl (CH3) substituent

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (dimethylnaphthalene): -0.27304164
- c1ccccc1 (benzene): -0.78181979
- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (methylanthracene): 0.12586664

The target molecule is most similar to dimethylnaphthalene (Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12), but has one less methyl group. Since methyl groups tend to increase the property value slightly (as seen in the pattern of methylated vs non-methylated aromatics in the training set), the value should be slightly lower than -0.27304164 but higher than benzene's value of -0.78181979.

Based on these patterns, I predict the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 to be approximately:

-0.35

This takes into account that it's a naphthalene system (which generally has higher values than benzene) with one methyl substituent (which provides a modest increase to the property value).

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 0.8842753078517966
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the given examples.

The target molecule is a barbiturate derivative with:
- A barbituric acid core (cyclic urea with 3 carbonyls)
- A branched alkyl substituent
- A terminal alkene group

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a value of 0.0 (this is very similar but with a simpler substituent)
- Other molecules with similar size and polarity tend to have values between -1 and 1
- The addition of the longer alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) compared to just methyl would likely increase the value slightly

Considering these factors:
1. The base barbiturate structure contribution
2. The slight increase due to larger alkyl substituent
3. The presence of the alkene group
4. The overall polarity and size of the molecule

I predict the property value would be approximately 0.35

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly larger and more lipophilic than the similar example molecule, but maintains similar core functionality.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.3623419170577699
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which has:
- A benzene ring (phenyl group)
- A CF₃ (trifluoromethyl) substituent

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values between -0.5 and 0.5
2. Halogenated compounds (like Clc1ccc(I)cc1) show slightly positive values
3. The presence of fluorine atoms typically increases lipophilicity but not as much as chlorine or bromine
4. Single-ring aromatics with small substituents generally have moderate values

Considering these factors:
- The base benzene structure would contribute a small negative value
- The CF₃ group would add a positive contribution, but less than what multiple chlorines would add
- The molecule is relatively small and symmetric

Based on these considerations and comparing with similar structures in the training set (especially halogenated aromatics), I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.32

This prediction takes into account that the value should be:
- Higher than unsubstituted benzene
- Lower than polychlorinated compounds
- Similar to but slightly lower than mono-halogenated benzenes in the training set

True Property: -0.023818721446769827
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, I can make several observations:

1. This is a cyclic sugar-like molecule (a monosaccharide) with multiple hydroxyl groups
2. It's similar in structure to OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO from the examples, which had a value of -8.322e-05
3. Both molecules have:
   - Multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups
   - A similar carbon backbone
   - Similar oxygen content
   - Similar molecular weight
   - Similar polarity

The main difference is that the query molecule is cyclic while the example molecule is linear, but they share very similar chemical properties in terms of hydrophilicity and hydrogen bonding capability.

Given these similarities and the fact that cyclic sugars tend to have similar properties to their linear counterparts, I would predict a value very close to the similar example molecule.

Predicted value: -0.00015

This prediction takes into account the slight structural difference while maintaining the same order of magnitude as the similar reference compound.

4. Based on these factors:
- The property value should be higher than simpler steroids
- The additional polar groups will contribute to the value
- The structural similarity to the reference steroids suggests a value in a similar range

Considering all these factors, I predict the property value to be approximately:

3.85

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to known steroids while accounting for the additional functional groups and modifications present in the target molecule.

   - The complexity and size of the molecule appears to correlate with the value

Given that fluorene is:
- Smaller than pentacene
- Has a similar aromatic character
- Contains three fused rings
- Is relatively symmetric
- Has no functional groups

I would predict a property value of approximately 0.45

This prediction takes into account that the value should be:
- Lower than pentacene (0.69) due to smaller size
- Higher than benzene derivatives (-0.5 to 0)
- Similar to other fused ring systems without substituents

The predicted value of 0.45 reflects the molecule's intermediate complexity and purely hydrocarbon nature.

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 0.4466265320455038
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains:
- A sulfonamide group (-SO2-)
- An aromatic ring with an amino substituent
- A guanidine-like structure (-NC(=N)N-)

2. Looking at the training examples:
- Molecules with polar groups (like -NH2, -SO2-) tend to have moderate positive values

- Contains multiple hydrogen bond donors and acceptors

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.85

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate size, polarity, and the presence of multiple functional groups that typically contribute to higher values in the training set.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 4.049710021390033
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the given molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, I notice:

1. It contains nitro groups (N(=O)=O)
2. Has a trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)
3. Contains an alkene group (C=C)
4. Has a tertiary amine structure
5. Contains a substituted benzene ring

Analyzing similar patterns in the training set:
- Molecules with nitro groups tend to have values around 0 to 3
- More complex structures with multiple functional groups tend to have higher values
- The presence of fluorine atoms typically increases the value
- Multiple electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and CF3) tend to increase the value

Based on these observations and the complexity of the molecule, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

2.84

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of two nitro groups
- The trifluoromethyl substituent
- The overall molecular complexity
- The tertiary amine and alkene portions
- The electronic effects of all substituents combined

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.7359844630509668
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, a relatively simple ester.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Small molecules generally have negative values
2. Molecules with O=C (carbonyl) groups often have values around -0.5 to -0.8
3. Similar structures like CC(C)CCOC=O has a value of -0.58105248
4. Other simple esters and similar small oxygenated molecules tend to have values in the -0.5 to -0.7 range
5. The presence of branching (isopropyl group) tends to make values slightly less negative

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to other molecules in the training set, particularly other small esters and formates, I predict the property value for CC(C)OC=O to be approximately:

-0.62

This prediction takes into account the molecule's:
- Small size
- Presence of an ester group
- Branched structure
- Similarity to other molecules in the training set with comparable functional groups and size

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.5420874115206163
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethyl phenol:
- It has a benzene ring as the core structure
- Contains two methyl (C) substituents
- Has one hydroxyl (O) group

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple phenol (c1ccccc1O) has a value of -0.70623298
- Methylated aromatics tend to be slightly negative (like CCc1ccccc1C at -0.55512799)
- The presence of hydroxyl groups generally decreases the value
- The molecule is relatively small and simple compared to the high-value complex polychlorinated compounds

Given these observations:
- The base phenol value is around -0.70
- The two methyl groups would likely increase the value slightly
- The overall complexity is low

Based on these considerations, I would predict a value of approximately -0.58 for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1.

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly more complex than simple phenol but still maintains similar core characteristics, and the methyl groups would moderately increase the value from the base phenol while keeping it in the negative range typical for similar small aromatic compounds.

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 1.8805182732865118
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, I notice:

1. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)) similar to several high-value examples
2. It has methoxy groups (OC) attached to the phosphorus
3. It has an aromatic ring with substituents
4. The substituents are relatively mild (methylthio and methyl groups)

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a value of 3.48642295
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has a value of 6.005394
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has a value of 10.14348297

The target molecule has the same basic phosphorothioate structure but with less electronegative substituents (SC and C instead of Cl, Br, or I). This would likely result in a lower value than these reference compounds.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value would be approximately:

2.8 ± 0.5

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a positive value due to the phosphorothioate group, but lower than the chlorinated/brominated/iodinated analogs due to less electronegative substituents.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 3.7137202256203294
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples.

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has several key characteristics:
1. It contains multiple chlorine atoms (5 Cl atoms)
2. It has a biphenyl-like structure (two benzene rings connected)
3. The chlorines are distributed across both rings
4. It's a relatively large, hydrophobic molecule

Looking at similar structures from the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl had a value of 5.65760102
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl had a value of 8.364851

The target molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than the second reference (5 vs 7)
- Same number of chlorines as the first reference (5)
- Similar biphenyl core structure
- Similar distribution of substituents

Based on these structural comparisons and the observed trend that more chlorinated biphenyls tend to have higher values, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

4.8

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly less chlorinated than the highest value reference but maintains the key structural features that seem to contribute to higher property values in the training set.
==================================================
Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7312084191401347
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O, propyl nitrite) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. It has a short carbon chain (3 carbons)
3. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - Simple alkanes (CCC) have values around -0.9
   - Molecules with N(=O)=O groups tend to increase the value
   - Small molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups typically have values between -1 and 0

Considering these factors and patterns from the training data:
- The base alkyl chain would contribute negatively (like propane)
- The nitro group would increase the value somewhat
- The size and complexity is relatively low

Based on this analysis, I would predict a value of approximately -0.65 for CCCN(=O)=O.

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly more complex than simple alkanes but less complex than the larger aromatic nitro compounds in the training set, and considers the general trend that nitro groups tend to increase the value somewhat from the base hydrocarbon value.

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.08247056241616657
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobromobenzene, where fluorine and bromine are substituted on a benzene ring.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of 0.11534943 (dihalogenated benzene)
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 patterns show halogen substitutions affect the value
- Other aromatic halogenated compounds tend to have values between -0.4 and 0.3

Key considerations:
1. The molecule has two halogen substituents (F and Br)
2. They are in meta position to each other
3. Fluorine typically has less impact on this property than bromine
4. The structure is similar to other dihalogenated benzenes in the training set

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 to be approximately:

0.08

This prediction takes into account that the value should be:
- Similar to but slightly lower than Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (0.11534943)
- Higher than mono-halogenated benzenes
- Reflective of the meta-substitution pattern

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.29116362942188473
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, I notice:
1. It's a bicyclic structure
2. Contains an OH group
3. Has multiple methyl substituents
4. Is relatively compact and saturated
5. Has some structural similarity to some of the steroid-like structures in the training set, but is much simpler

Analyzing similar structures from the training set:
- Simple alcohols tend to have negative values (around -0.7 to -0.6)
- Bicyclic structures tend to increase the value
- The complexity and presence of rings tends to push values higher
- However, this molecule is much simpler than the complex steroids that showed very high values

Based on these observations and the molecule's features, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.15

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is more complex than simple alcohols (which would push it above the negative values) but much simpler than the complex steroids in the training set (which had very high positive values). The bicyclic nature and presence of the OH group suggests a moderate value in the slightly positive range.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 2.576293590440354
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, I notice:

1. It's structurally similar to CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O from the training set (which had a value of 8.22980609), but with some key differences
2. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S)
3. Has a phthalimide ring system
4. Contains ethoxy groups (OCC)
5. Lacks the CCl group present in the similar training molecule

Given these observations:
- The base structure suggests a relatively high value
- The removal of the CCl and S-C linkage would reduce the value somewhat compared to the similar training molecule
- The core phthalimide and phosphorothioate groups still contribute significantly to the property

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately 6.8

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a high value due to its structural complexity and presence of P=S group, but somewhat lower than the similar training molecule due to the mentioned structural differences.

Iteration: 34
SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 0.07407379150333059
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a pyrazolone derivative with:
- A pyrazolone core (5-membered ring with N-N and C=O)
- Two methyl groups (C) attached to nitrogens
- A phenyl ring (c2ccccc2) attached to one of the nitrogens
- A carbonyl group (C=O)

Looking at the training examples:
1. Molecules with heterocyclic rings containing N atoms typically have values around 0.5-1.5
2. The presence of C=O groups tends to contribute positively to the property
3. Phenyl substituents generally increase the value moderately
4. The molecule size and complexity is moderate, similar to several examples with values in the 0.5-1.2 range

Considering these patterns and the structural similarities with molecules like:
- O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23 (0.65221082)
- CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2 (0.76445863)

I predict the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C to be approximately:

0.72

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate size, presence of both aromatic and heterocyclic rings, carbonyl group, and N-containing heterocycle, which all contribute to a value in this range.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.37814038719274223
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCC(=O)OCC - ethyl hexanoate) and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the patterns in the given examples, I notice:

1. Simple aliphatic esters tend to have values between -1 and 0
2. Longer carbon chains tend to increase the value slightly
3. The presence of ester groups (C(=O)O) typically contributes to a slightly negative value
4. Similar compounds like CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl nonanoate) has a value of -0.11238945

For CCCCCC(=O)OCC (ethyl hexanoate):
- It's a medium-length aliphatic ester
- Has a straight carbon chain
- Contains one ester functional group
- Similar in structure to other aliphatic esters in the training set
- Slightly shorter than the methyl nonanoate example

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Less negative than simple esters like COC=O (-0.85428159)
- More negative than longer chain esters like CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (-0.11238945)
- In line with other medium-length aliphatic compounds

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.44217283105979727
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples and analyzing the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1. This molecule is structurally similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) which has a value of -0.32749303
2. The only difference is that our target molecule has a methyl ester (COC(=O)-) instead of an ethyl ester
3. Generally, methyl groups vs ethyl groups in similar structures tend to make small differences in this property
4. Looking at other aromatic esters in the training set, like CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 (-0.17634049), we can see they tend to be in the negative range
5. The molecule is relatively simple and small, which typically corresponds to lower absolute values

Based on these observations, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account that methyl esters tend to be slightly more negative in this property than their ethyl counterparts, but maintains the general magnitude seen in similar structures.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.823467705538073
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule C=CCC=C (1,4-pentadiene) has the following characteristics:
1. It's a small hydrocarbon
2. Contains two double bonds
3. Has a linear structure
4. Similar in size to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- CC/C=C/C (2-pentene) has a value of -0.81538646
- C=Cc1ccccc1 (styrene) has a value of -0.65251031
- Simple hydrocarbons generally have negative values
- Molecules with similar size but less unsaturation (like C1CCCC1) have values around -0.81

Given that:
1. The molecule is similar in size to 2-pentene
2. It has one additional double bond which might slightly increase the value
3. It maintains the simple hydrocarbon structure
4. It lacks any functional groups that would dramatically alter the property

I predict the property value would be approximately: -0.78

This prediction takes into account that the additional unsaturation would likely make it slightly less negative than 2-pentene, but still firmly in the negative range typical of simple hydrocarbons.

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 1.200265086768911
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (tribromomethane/bromoform) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Halogenated compounds generally have positive values
2. Small molecules with multiple halogens tend to have values between 0 and 2
3. Similar structures like FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br showed a value of 0.19461353
4. The number and type of halogens affect the value, with more halogens generally increasing it
5. Bromine substituents tend to give slightly higher values than chlorine

Given that CBr3 is:
- A small molecule
- Contains three bromine atoms
- Similar in structure to other trihalomethanes
- More polarizable than chloroform due to bromine atoms

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CBr3 to be approximately:

0.45

This value takes into account that it should be:
- Higher than similar chlorinated compounds
- Lower than larger halogenated aromatics
- Positive due to the presence of multiple halogens
- Moderate in magnitude due to its small size despite high halogen content

1. The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
- Two ethoxy groups (OCC)
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl)
- A phthalimide ring system
- Several aliphatic carbons

2. Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
- Molecules with P=S groups tend to have higher values (like the example with COP(=S))
- Presence of chlorine typically increases the value
- Complex ring systems with carbonyls contribute positively
- The combination of heteroatoms (O, S, N) with aromatic systems generally leads to higher values

3. Most similar examples from the training set:
- COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 (6.13609146)
- This is structurally quite similar, though with some differences

Based on these considerations and the overall structural complexity and similarity to known examples, I predict the property value to be approximately:

5.8

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has similar structural elements to compounds in the 5-7 range in the training set, but with some variations that might slightly modify the final value.

True Property: 4.338375685544456
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, I notice:

1. It contains a chlorine substituent (Cl)
2. Has multiple nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic structures
3. Contains a urea-like linkage C(=O)N
4. Has a tert-butyl group C(C)(C)C
5. Contains an oxadiazolone ring system
6. Has both aromatic and aliphatic regions

Analyzing the training set:
- Molecules with similar complexity and multiple heteroatoms tend to have positive values
- Chlorinated aromatics generally contribute to higher values
- Presence of heterocycles typically increases the value
- Molecules with similar size and multiple functional groups show values in the range of 0.5 to 4.0

Based on these observations and the structural features, I predict the property value to be approximately:

2.84

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, presence of chlorine, multiple nitrogen atoms, and mixed aromatic/aliphatic character, placing it in a moderate-to-high range but not as high as the very lipophilic or highly complex structures in the training set that showed values above 6.

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has:
- A diphenyl ether core structure
- Three chlorine substituents
- One hydroxyl group
- Multiple aromatic rings

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl has a value of -0.20819456
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a value of 0.7578125
- c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2 has a value of 0.07946557
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 has a value of 0.5961611

The target molecule is larger than the first example but has similar functional groups. It has more chlorines than the biphenyl examples but fewer than the tetrachlorophenol. The ether linkage and hydroxyl group would contribute to slightly lower values compared to just chlorinated biphenyls.

Based on these structural comparisons and the observed property values in the training set, I predict the property value for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl to be approximately:

0.48

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a higher value than simple chlorophenols but lower than heavily chlorinated compounds, while considering the effect of the ether linkage and hydroxyl group.

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.8153864556389129
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I notice this molecule is a geometric isomer (Z-isomer) of CC/C=C/C (E-isomer) which has a known property value of -0.81538646.

The molecule CC/C=C\C is pent-2-ene with a Z configuration. Given that this is a geometric isomer of the E-pent-2-ene shown in the training examples, and considering that Z/E isomers often have similar physical and chemical properties with small variations, I would predict the property value to be very close to but slightly different from -0.81538646.

Based on the general trend that Z-isomers often have slightly higher values than E-isomers for many physical properties (like boiling point), I would predict the property value to be:

-0.78

This prediction takes into account:
1. The very close structural similarity to the E-isomer
2. The typical small differences between Z/E isomers
3. The general trend of Z-isomers having slightly higher values
4. The overall scale of values seen in the training set

- Contains one oxygen atom
- Has moderate chain length
- Is similar to other ethers in the dataset

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCCOCC to be approximately:

-0.65

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's a simple molecule (suggesting negative value)
2. Contains an oxygen (slightly raising the value compared to pure hydrocarbons)
3. Has similar complexity to other molecules with values in this range
4. Shows structural similarity to other ethers in the dataset

2. It has a urea-like structure (N(C=O)N)
3. It contains tertiary carbon with two methyl groups
4. It has similar structural elements to some of the training examples with values around 2-3

Key observations from training data:

- A para-brominated benzene ring
- An overall structure similar to some of the examples

Looking at the training examples:
- Molecules with bromine substituents tend to have values around -0.1 to 0.0
- Simple aromatic compounds with polar substituents typically have values between -0.6 and 0.0
- Acetamide-like structures tend to slightly increase the value
- Para-substituted aromatics in the examples show moderate values

Considering these patterns and the structural features, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.12

This prediction takes into account:
1. The presence of the bromine (which tends to increase the value)
2. The acetamide group (which contributes to polarity)
3. The para-substitution pattern
4. The overall molecular size and complexity

This is my best estimate based on the patterns observed in the training set and my chemical expertise.

True Property: 0.02477163119598032
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule and the given examples, I'll make a prediction based on pattern recognition and molecular structure similarities.

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally very similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training examples, which had a value of 0.0005589. The only difference is that our target molecule has an NH linkage instead of a N=N linkage.

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Similar sized aromatic compounds tend to have values between -0.5 and 1.0
2. The presence of nitrogen atoms typically doesn't drastically change the value
3. The reduction of a double bond to a single bond typically shifts the value slightly higher

Given these observations and the very close structural similarity to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (0.0005589), but accounting for the reduced bond order, I would predict the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 to be approximately:

0.15 (±0.1)

- Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 (-0.20819456)

Considering that:
1. This is a simpler structure than most examples
2. Bromine substituents typically lead to slightly higher values than chlorine
3. The para substitution pattern is generally more stable
4. The molecule has similar polarity to some of the reference compounds

I predict the property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 to be approximately 0.15

This prediction takes into account the symmetrical nature of the molecule, the electronic effects of bromine substituents, and the patterns observed in the training data.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 5.65760102099318
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the target molecule, I notice this is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure, similar to some of the examples provided. The molecule contains multiple chlorine substituents on a biphenyl core structure.

The most similar molecule in the training set is:
Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (with property value 24.69944521)

The target molecule has:
- A biphenyl core structure
- 6 chlorine substituents (compared to 10 in the most similar example)
- Similar spatial arrangement of substituents

Considering that:
1. The property appears to increase significantly with the number of chlorine atoms
2. The biphenyl core structure contributes to the property
3. The target molecule has fewer chlorines than the most similar example
4. The property seems to scale somewhat proportionally with molecular size and halogen content

I would predict a property value of approximately 14.82 for the target molecule.

This prediction takes into account that the target molecule has 60% of the chlorines compared to the most similar example, but maintains the basic structural features that appear to drive the property value.

- Chlorinated compounds generally show higher values (examples range from 0.8 to 4)
- Cyclic amide-containing structures (like O=C1N(...)) tend to have values around 1-5
- The combination of halogens (F, Cl) typically increases the value

Considering these factors and the overall molecular structure, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

2.85

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of multiple halogens (F, Cl)

True Property: -0.30125252772476335
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples and analyzing the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (methoxy-nitrobenzene), I can make several observations:

1. It contains an aromatic ring with two substituents: a methoxy group (-OCH3) and a nitro group (-NO2)
2. Similar compounds in the training set include:
   - O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (dinitrobenzene) with value -0.15646344
   - Simple aromatic compounds with substituents tend to have values between -0.7 and 0.0
   - Compounds with nitro groups tend to be slightly higher in value than their non-nitro counterparts

Based on these patterns, I would predict a value around -0.25 to 0.0 for this molecule. 

My specific prediction would be: -0.18

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The molecule is more polar than benzene due to the nitro and methoxy groups
2. It's less polar than dinitrobenzene
3. The methoxy group typically has a mild effect on this property
4. The overall molecular size and complexity is moderate

1. It's a long-chain ester with 12 carbons total
2. Contains a single ester group (C(=O)O)
3. Has a long linear alkyl chain
4. No aromatic rings, halogens, or other functional groups

Looking at the training examples:
- Simple alkanes/alkenes tend to have negative values
- Longer chains tend to increase the value slightly
- Esters generally contribute to slightly negative or near-zero values
- The complexity and presence of multiple functional groups tends to increase the value

Comparing specifically to:
- CCCCC(CC)C=O (-0.5005151) - similar chain length but with aldehyde
- CCOC (-0.79893135) - simple ester but much shorter
- Other linear molecules in the set tend to have values between -0.8 and -0.2

Given these patterns and the molecule's structure, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.42

- The presence of both polar groups (OH, NO2) and hydrophobic elements (Cl) tends to result in higher values

Comparing to similar molecules in the training set:
- CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2 (2.27576074)
- Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl (2.23529778)
- Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (-0.26066136)

Given the combination of structural features and comparing with similar molecules in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1. Phosphorothioate group (P=S)
2. Two ethoxy groups (OCCC)
3. A thioester linkage (SCC)
4. An amide group (C(=O)N)

Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.5930889929878018
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:
1. The property appears to correlate with molecular complexity and functional groups
2. Simple linear alkanes tend to have negative values around -0.4 to -0.7
3. The more complex and functionalized molecules have higher positive values
4. Molecules with similar structures have similar values

For CCCCCCCC (octane), which is a simple linear alkane:
- It's similar to CCCCCCCO (heptanol) which has -0.58077518
- It's also similar to CCCCCC1CCCC1 (a cyclic alkane) which has -0.41007835
- Being a simple hydrocarbon without any functional groups, it should have a slightly more negative value than heptanol
- It's longer than most of the simple alkanes shown in the examples, but follows the same pattern

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCC to be approximately:

-0.63

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's a simple alkane (negative value)
2. It has no functional groups
3. It's slightly longer than some reference molecules
4. It follows the pattern seen with other similar hydrocarbons in the training set

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 3.1737084874745776
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule appears to be a steroid-like structure with:
- A steroid core skeleton
- Two hydroxyl groups (O)
- One ketone group (=O)
- An alkyne group (C#C)

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
1. CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O (2.19830536) - Very similar steroid core
2. CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO (8.10438252) - Similar but more substituted
3. CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C (3.90937391) - Also similar steroid structure

The target molecule has structural features common to these examples, particularly the first one, but with an additional hydroxyl group and an alkyne group. The presence of the alkyne group and second hydroxyl group would likely increase the property value somewhat compared to the first example, but not as much as the heavily substituted second example.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value to be approximately:

3.45

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is more functionalized than example 1 but less than examples 2 and 3, and considers the contribution of the alkyne group which isn't present in the training examples.

True Property: 60.33292722386011
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule and the given examples, I notice this is a complex natural product-like structure containing multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters, acetals), fused ring systems, and aromatic regions.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Larger, more complex molecules tend to have higher values
2. Molecules with multiple oxygen-containing groups and fused rings often have higher values
3. Natural product-like structures with multiple stereocenters (like the example with value 10.32326842) have relatively high values

Given that this molecule:
- Has significant structural complexity
- Contains multiple oxygen-containing functional groups
- Features fused ring systems
- Has similarities to natural product scaffolds
- Contains multiple stereocenters
- Has aromatic regions with methoxy substitutions

I would predict a property value of approximately 8.45

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is complex but not as extensively halogenated as some of the highest-value examples, while being more complex than the simple aromatic compounds that showed lower values.

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.4980841754498954
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol - specifically 2-chlorophenol. Let me analyze the key features:

1. It has a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) as the base structure
2. Contains both a hydroxyl (-OH) and chloro (-Cl) substituents
3. The substituents are ortho to each other
4. Similar to some examples but simpler than most

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) has -0.69598661
- Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (2-nitrophenol) has -0.41924364
- Clc1ccccc1I (2-iodochlorobenzene) has 0.88770404

The target molecule is most similar to these examples, but with different substituents. The hydroxyl group typically reduces the value compared to just halogens, while chlorine tends to increase it slightly compared to fluorine.

Based on these patterns and the relative effects of the substituents, I would predict the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl to be approximately:

-0.35

This takes into account that it should be:
- Higher than fluorobenzene (-0.69598661)
- Lower than 2-iodochlorobenzene (0.88770404)
- Similar to but slightly higher than 2-nitrophenol (-0.41924364) since -Cl is less electron-withdrawing than -NO2

1. Contains multiple aromatic rings
2. Has chlorine substituents
3. Contains a hydroxyl group
4. Has a pyrimidine ring (cncnc)
5. Has a complex 3D structure with a central carbon bearing OH and three different substituents

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:

1) It's an ester, similar to CCCC(=O)OCC (ethyl butyrate) which has a value of -0.58105248
2) It has a similar carbon chain length to CCCCCC=O (hexanal) which has a value of -0.67449076
3) It contains a formate group (OC=O) which generally contributes to lower values
4) The molecule is relatively small and simple, which in this dataset tends to correlate with negative values
5) Looking at other aliphatic molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups in the dataset, they tend to have values between -0.5 and -0.8

Considering these factors, especially the similarity to ethyl butyrate and hexanal, and the general trend of simple oxygenated compounds in the dataset, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.63

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a value:
- More negative than ethyl butyrate due to the formate group
- Similar to but slightly less negative than hexanal due to the ester vs aldehyde functionality
- In line with other simple aliphatic oxygenated compounds in the dataset

True Property: -0.7510196036701926
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1) Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- ClCCCl has a value of -0.68094182
- This is the most similar molecule, just differing by one carbon

2) Key observations:
- Small halogenated molecules tend to have negative values
- The molecule in question is smaller than ClCCCl
- Simple, small molecules generally have more negative values in this dataset
- The presence of chlorine atoms appears to make values less negative compared to pure hydrocarbons

3) Analyzing patterns:
- Short chain halogenated compounds show values around -0.6 to -0.7
- Smaller molecules tend to have more negative values than their larger counterparts
- The molecule we're predicting is very similar to ClCCCl but with one less carbon

Based on these considerations, I would predict a value of approximately -0.71 for ClCCl.

This prediction takes into account that it should be slightly more negative than ClCCCl (-0.68094182) due to its smaller size, but not dramatically different due to the similar chemical nature.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (-0.32710841) - a methylated phenol
- Oc1cccc(O)c1 (-0.61807422) - dihydroxybenzene
- Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (-0.41924364) - substituted phenol

Key observations:
1. Phenols generally show negative values
2. Adding methyl groups tends to make the value less negative compared to unsubstituted phenols
3. The position of substituents affects the value
4. The target molecule is most similar to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O

Given these patterns and considering that:
- Our target molecule has two methyl groups (less polar than the training examples)

Looking at the given examples and the target molecule, I notice several patterns:

1. The molecule contains multiple chlorine substituents (4 Cl atoms) on a biphenyl structure
2. It's similar to other chlorinated biphenyls in the training set, particularly:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (5.65760102)
- Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (3.71372023)

The target molecule has:
- 4 chlorines (less than the first reference with 6 Cl, more than second with 2 Cl)
- Similar biphenyl core structure
- Chlorines distributed on both rings

Based on these observations and the trend that:
- More chlorine atoms generally increase the property value

- The similar trichlorophenol in the training set has a value of ~0.20

Given these observations and the structural similarity to the training example, I would predict a value of approximately 0.22 for this molecule. The slight increase from the training example (0.19553577) is due to the different substitution pattern which might affect the property slightly differently.

Therefore, my predicted value is: 0.22

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.3274930321909881
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ethyl benzoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple esters tend to have values around -0.5 to -0.4
2. Benzene rings with substituents typically shift values slightly higher
3. The structure CCOC(=O)- pattern appears in some examples with similar values

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.036057622930764345
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is 1-bromoheptane, a straight-chain alkyl bromide.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple linear molecules tend to have negative values
2. Halogenated compounds generally have higher values than their non-halogenated counterparts
3. Longer carbon chains tend to have values closer to zero compared to shorter chains
4. Simple bromine-containing compounds like "Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1" have positive values (0.33434685)

Considering these factors:
- It's a relatively simple linear molecule (suggesting negative value)
- Contains a bromine (suggesting slightly higher value than equivalent alkane)
- Has a moderate carbon chain length (7 carbons)
- Similar in complexity to molecules like CCCCCCC=C (-0.60543847) but with Br instead of double bond

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Less negative than shorter chain compounds
- More positive than equivalent alkanes due to the bromine
- In a similar range to other simple linear molecules in the dataset

SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.9444830170067677
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (methanol - CO) by comparing it to the training examples and looking for patterns in molecular structure and corresponding property values.

I notice that:
1. Small, simple molecules generally have negative values
2. Alcohols (-OH containing compounds) typically have negative values
3. The simplest molecules in the training set (like CCC at -0.91) have the most negative values
4. Other small molecules with oxygen (like CCCCOC=O at -0.66) also have negative values
5. Molecules with similar polarity and size tend to have similar values

Methanol (CO) is:
- A very small molecule
- Contains an alcohol group
- Has similar polarity to some of the simple alcohols in the training set
- Simpler than most molecules in the training set

Based on these observations and patterns, and considering that methanol is even simpler than many of the reference compounds, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.85

This prediction takes into account that it should be more negative than larger alcohols but in a similar range to other simple molecules in the training set.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 17.795828111352932
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the given molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, I notice:

1. It's a relatively large, symmetric molecule
2. Contains two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)OC)
3. Contains sulfur bridges between aromatic rings
4. Has multiple aromatic rings
5. Contains multiple oxygen and sulfur atoms
6. Shows structural similarity to some pesticide-like compounds in the training set

Looking at the training examples:
- Larger, more complex molecules with multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms tend to have higher values
- Molecules containing phosphorothioate groups and multiple aromatic rings with heteroatom substituents (like in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 = 6.13609146) show high values
- The presence of sulfur and phosphorus tends to increase the value

Based on these observations and the structural similarities to other complex molecules in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

5.8

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, symmetry, and the presence of phosphorothioate groups, while considering it might be slightly less than some of the highest values in the training set due to its symmetric nature.

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.41924363936114173
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is a nitrophenol, specifically 3-nitrophenol (or m-nitrophenol). Looking at the training examples, I notice:

1. Similar structures:
- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (2-nitrotoluene) has a value of -0.43459189
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (salicylamide) also has a value of -0.43459189
- Simple phenols like Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 has a value of -0.54208741

2. Key observations:
- The presence of nitro group (N(=O)=O) tends to increase the value slightly
- Hydroxyl group (OH) on benzene tends to decrease the value
- The meta-substitution pattern typically has values in between ortho and para positions

Based on these patterns and considering the combined effects of:
- The hydroxyl group (decreasing effect)
- The nitro group (slightly increasing effect)
- The meta-substitution pattern

I would predict the property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O to be approximately:

-0.48

This prediction takes into account that it should be slightly more negative than 2-nitrotoluene due to the hydroxyl group, but not as negative as simple phenols due to the presence of the nitro group.

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 26.18083273902975
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule and the given examples, I notice this is a complex carbohydrate-like structure with multiple sugar rings and hydroxyl groups. Looking at the patterns in the training examples:

1. Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) and oxygen atoms tend to have lower (negative or small positive) values
2. The example C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O (a simple sugar structure) has a value of -0.32790369
3. The given molecule is significantly larger and more complex than most examples, but maintains similar structural elements (multiple OH groups, oxygen bridges)
4. Highly polar molecules with many H-bond donors and acceptors generally show lower values
5. The molecule lacks any aromatic or lipophilic regions that tend to give higher positive values

Given these observations and the structural similarity to sugars but with increased complexity, I would predict a value around:

-0.15 to -0.25

This prediction takes into account that while it's similar to the simple sugar example (-0.32790369), its larger size and additional oxygen bridges might slightly moderate the negative value.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -0.8755600160314849
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCC#C - but-1-yne) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple, small hydrocarbons tend to have negative values
2. Molecules with triple bonds (like N#Cc1ccccc1C#N) tend to have negative values
3. The length of carbon chain affects the value
4. The presence of functional groups and their position matters

For CCC#C (but-1-yne):
- It's a small hydrocarbon (4 carbons)
- Contains a terminal triple bond
- Linear structure
- No other functional groups
- Similar in size/complexity to molecules like CCCC(=O)C which has value -0.7453826

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.65

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's a small molecule (suggesting negative value)
- The triple bond would contribute to slightly less negative value than fully saturated analogs
- Its simplicity and size are comparable to other small hydrocarbons in the training set

The target molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has several key features:
1. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S)
2. Has three chlorine substituents on a benzene ring
3. Contains ethoxy and ethyl groups attached to phosphorus
4. Has an oxygen linking the phosphorothioate to the aromatic ring

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Organophosphate/thiophosphate compounds like COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 have values around 6.1
- Tri-chlorinated aromatics like Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl have values around 0.0
- When combining phosphorothioate groups with halogenated aromatics, values tend to be in the 3-4 range
- CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC has a value of 3.90, and shares some structural similarities

Based on these observations and considering:
- The presence of three chlorines will increase lipophilicity
- The phosphorothioate group typically contributes significantly to the property
- The overall molecular size and complexity is moderate

I predict the property value to be approximately 3.85

This prediction takes into account both the structural features and the patterns seen in the training data, particularly focusing on similar phosphorus-containing compounds and chlorinated aromatics.

Key observations:
1. It's a relatively small molecule
2. Contains a pyridine ring (similar to some training examples)
3. Has a polar hydrazide group
4. Contains nitrogen atoms both in the ring and side chain
5. Has similar polarity to some of the simpler examples

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple pyridine-containing compounds tend to have values around -0.02 to 0.7
- The presence of polar groups like amines and carbonyls tends to decrease the value
- The molecule size is relatively small, which typically corresponds to lower values
- The combination of aromatic ring and polar substituents is similar to some examples with moderate negative values

Based on these patterns and considering the structural features, I would predict the property value to be approximately:
