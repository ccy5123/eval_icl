SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -1.214764992641568
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

The given molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester of a long-chain fatty acid (methyl decanoate).

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl dodecanoate) has a value of -1.53269955
2. Other long-chain aliphatic compounds (like CCCCCC, CCCCCCC(C)C) have values around 0.0
3. Shorter esters like CCOC(=O)CC have higher values (3.64730687)

The target molecule is most similar to CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, just with two fewer carbons in the chain. Since they share the same functional group (methyl ester) and similar chain length, they should have similar properties.

Given that the longer chain version has a value of -1.53269955, and considering that shorter chains tend to have slightly less negative values in this property scale, I would predict the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC to be approximately:

-1.45

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly smaller than the C12 version but maintains the same functional group and similar chemical characteristics.

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 3.8677595695072884
Predicted Property:

4. Looking at the pattern of aromatic compounds in the training set, adding methyl groups tends to increase the value
5. The naphthalene-based structures generally show values in the range of 2-3

Based on these observations, and particularly considering that our molecule would have a value between benzene (-0.09270983) and dimethylnaphthalene (2.41951122), but closer to dimethylnaphthalene since it maintains the naphthalene core structure, I would predict:

Predicted value: 2.10

This prediction takes into account that removing one methyl group from dimethylnaphthalene would slightly lower the value, but the naphthalene core structure would still maintain a relatively high value compared to simpler aromatic systems.

Key observations:
1. Both molecules share the same core barbituric acid structure (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1)
2. Both have a CC=C group attached
3. The main difference is that the new molecule has an additional C(C)CCC substituent

Based on these structural similarities and the patterns observed in the training set:

- The CC=C group contribution appears to be similar

Considering these factors, I would predict a value slightly higher than 2.10974558, approximately:

2.35

This prediction takes into account the slightly increased molecular size and complexity while maintaining the core structural contribution.

3. Is structurally similar to some compounds in the 2-3 range
4. But is less complex than compounds showing very high values

I would predict a property value of approximately 2.38869558 for this molecule.

1. This molecule is structurally very similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) from the training set, which has a value of -0.41550918

2. The only difference is that our target molecule has a methoxy (COC(=O)-) group instead of an ethoxy (CCOC(=O)-) group

3. Looking at other similar structures in the training set that contain aromatic rings with ester groups, they tend to have values around -0.41550918

4. The presence of the benzoate group seems to be a strong determining factor for this property

Given these observations, and particularly the very close structural similarity to ethyl benzoate, I would predict that COC(=O)c1ccccc1 would have a property value of:

-0.41550918

This prediction is based on the nearly identical structure to ethyl benzoate and the apparent consistency of this value for similar benzoate esters in the training set.

The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of:
- A benzene ring (c1ccccc1)
- An aldehyde group (O=C-H) attached to the ring

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values around -0.09 to 3.5
2. Single benzene rings with small substituents often have values closer to 0 or slightly negative
3. The presence of oxygen in similar structures seems to pull values towards lower numbers
4. Similar sized molecules with comparable polarity tend to cluster in similar ranges

Considering these factors and comparing to the most similar structures in the training set:
- COc1ccccc1 (anisole) has a value of 3.40264009
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1O has a value of -0.09270983
- Simple substituted benzenes tend to be around -0.09 to 0.0

Given that benzaldehyde has a structure and polarity intermediate between these examples, but closer to the simpler substituted benzenes, I would predict:

-0.09270983

This prediction takes into account the molecule's size, the presence of the oxygen, and its similarity to other single-ring aromatic compounds in the training set.

- A simple, small molecule
- Contains two chlorine atoms
- Has similar structural features to other chlorinated compounds in the dataset
- Is less complex than most molecules in the training set
- Shows similar electronic properties to other chlorinated compounds

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict the property value for ClCCl to be:

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (very similar, just different chlorine positions) has value -0.09270983
2. Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 (trihalogenated benzene) has value -0.09270983
3. Other halogenated aromatics tend to have values around -0.09 to 0.0

Given that the most similar molecule (the trichlorophenol isomer) has a value of -0.09270983, and the molecular features are very similar (same number of chlorines, phenol structure, similar substitution pattern), I would predict the property value to be:

-0.09270983

This prediction is based on the very close structural similarity to the training example and the consistent pattern seen with other halogenated aromatic compounds in the dataset.

True Property: -0.2709121252514741
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The given molecule is a complex natural product-like structure with:
- Multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters)
- A methylenedioxy group (OCO)
- Multiple rings including aromatic and aliphatic systems
- Hydroxyl groups
- Complex stereochemistry

2. Looking at the training examples:
- Molecules with multiple oxygen-containing groups and complex ring systems tend to have positive values
- Natural product-like structures (like steroids) typically show values between 1.5 and 4.0
- The complexity and size of this molecule is most similar to some of the larger structures in the training set

3. Key similarities with training examples:
- Contains similar functional groups to some of the higher-value compounds
- Has a comparable molecular weight and complexity to examples with values around 3-4
- Contains both aromatic and aliphatic regions

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

3.35974289

This prediction is based on the structural similarity to other complex, multi-ring oxygenated compounds in the training set, particularly those containing both aromatic and aliphatic regions with multiple oxygen-containing functional groups.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -1.4973570159207048
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C has:
- A heterocyclic ring structure containing nitrogen atoms
- A thioether (CS-) group
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)
- An amino substituent (-N)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings containing N atoms tend to have values around -1 to 1
- The presence of sulfur-containing groups often contributes to values in a similar range
- The tert-butyl group appears in CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C which has a value of 1.71219525

Considering these structural features and the closest analogues in the training set, I predict the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C to be approximately:

1.51809284

This prediction takes into account the similar electronic and structural features seen in the training set, particularly the presence of the heterocyclic ring system and the tert-butyl group.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.4155091795282542
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate:
- It has an aromatic ring (benzene)
- Contains an ester group (-C(=O)OC-)
- Has a relatively simple structure

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Simple esters like CCCCCC(=O)OC and CCCCC(=O)OCC both have values around 1.12
- Molecules with single benzene rings and functional groups often have values between -0.09 and 3.40
- The presence of ester groups tends to give positive values
- The complexity and size is moderate

Based on these observations, and particularly the similarity to other ester-containing compounds in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

1.11974769

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has similar structural features to other esters in the training set, while also considering the presence of the benzene ring.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a straight-chain haloalkane (specifically a bromoheptane).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple halogenated compounds tend to have values around 0 to 3.5
2. Long straight-chain alkyl compounds often show positive values
3. Similar bromine-containing compounds like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 have values around -0.09
4. Straight-chain compounds with 7-8 carbons like CCCCCCC=C have values around 3.74

Given that CCCCCCCBr:
- Has a straight-chain structure similar to CCCCCCC=C
- Contains a bromine instead of a double bond
- Has similar chain length to several positive-valued compounds in the training set
- Is a relatively simple haloalkane

I would predict a property value of approximately 3.40

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to other straight-chain compounds in the training set while considering the effect of the bromine substituent.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Looking at the training examples and analyzing the molecule CO (methanol), I notice several patterns:

1. Simple, small molecules like CCC (propane), CCBr (bromoethane), and similar structures often have a value of 0.0

2. The target molecule CO (methanol) is:
- A very small molecule
- Contains an oxygen (alcohol group)
- Similar in simplicity to other small molecules in the training set
- Structurally similar to CCC(C)CO and other simple alcohols which have value 0.0

3. Looking at molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups, especially simple alcohols like OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O and CCC(C)CO, they consistently show values of 0.0

Based on these observations, particularly the consistent pattern of simple alcohols having a value of 0.0, and the general trend of very simple molecules showing this same value, I predict that the property value for CO (methanol) would be:

0.0
