SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 657.5908591326393
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester with a long alkyl chain (10 carbons in the main chain).

Looking at similar patterns in the training data:
- CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (12 carbons) has a value of 1191.40876392
- Longer chain aliphatic compounds tend to have positive values
- Esters (C(=O)OC group) tend to modify the base value
- The length of the carbon chain appears to correlate positively with the value
- Similar functional groups show consistent contributions to the property

Given that this molecule is similar to CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC but with two fewer carbons in the chain, I would expect the value to be somewhat lower but still positive.

Based on these observations, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC to be approximately:

1020.5

This prediction takes into account that it's slightly smaller than the 12-carbon example but maintains the same functional groups and overall structural characteristics.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 694.1959064363496
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The molecule "c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2" is biphenyl - two benzene rings connected directly to each other.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have positive values
2. The more complex and larger the aromatic system, the higher the value tends to be
3. Simple aromatic compounds without heteroatoms typically have values in the range of 300-800
4. The presence of conjugated aromatic systems increases the value

For biphenyl:
- It has two benzene rings (aromatic systems)
- It's relatively simple compared to larger PAHs in the training set
- It has no heteroatoms or substituents
- It has conjugation between the rings

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set (like "C1CCc2ccccc2C1" = 154.90434971 and "Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C" = 764.69654334), I would predict the property value for biphenyl to be approximately:

438.5

This prediction takes into account that biphenyl is larger than single-ring aromatics but smaller than the more complex PAH systems in the training set, and considers its purely hydrocarbon nature.

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -426.05538235552393
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule (CCCCS) and the pattern in the training examples to make a prediction.

CCCCS is a relatively simple molecule - it's butanethiol, a linear chain with a sulfur atom at the end.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple linear alkanes tend to have moderate positive values
2. Sulfur-containing compounds often have negative values, but not always
3. Shorter chain molecules generally have lower absolute values than complex aromatics
4. The presence of heteroatoms (like S) tends to modify the base hydrocarbon value

Some relevant comparisons from the training set:
- CCCCCC(C)C (604.63) - similar chain length but no sulfur
- CCCC(C)(C)C (337.72) - similar carbon count
- Simple linear molecules tend to be in the range of -300 to +800

Considering these patterns and the structural features of CCCCS, I would predict a value of approximately:

-156.4

This takes into account the moderate chain length, the presence of the sulfur atom which typically reduces the value, and the overall simplicity of the molecule.

- A terminal hydroxyl group (CO)

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- CCCC(C)(C)C (branched alkane): 70.81537189
- CCCC(C)(O)CC (branched alcohol): -267.86684148
- CC(C)CC(C)O (branched alcohol): -633.36994933
- CCCCOC (linear ether): -619.95950209

The target molecule shares features with these examples:
1. It has a similar carbon backbone to CCCC(C)(C)C
2. Contains a hydroxyl group like CCCC(C)(O)CC
3. Has branching pattern similar to both references

Considering these factors:
- The presence of the hydroxyl group typically reduces the value compared to pure hydrocarbons
- The branching pattern is similar to examples with moderate values
- The chain length is in a similar range to several reference compounds

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO to be approximately:

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 553.6735771796003
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples and analyzing the given molecule "Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1" (methylnaphthalene), I can make a prediction based on structural similarities and patterns in the training data.

The target molecule is very similar to several compounds in the training set, particularly:
- "Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12" (dimethylnaphthalene) with value 764.69654334
- "c1ccccc1" (benzene) with value -446.37631516
- "Cc1cccc(C)c1C" (trimethylbenzene) with value 186.69258331

The target molecule is a naphthalene with one methyl group, while one of the closest examples has two methyl groups on a naphthalene core. Since the target has one fewer methyl group than "Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12", the value should be lower but still in a similar range.

Based on these structural relationships and the observed impact of methyl substitutions in the training set, I would predict the property value for "Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1" to be approximately:

553.7

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The base naphthalene structure contributes significantly to the value
2. Each methyl group appears to add a positive contribution
3. The value should be lower than the dimethyl analog but higher than benzene

True Property: -675.927593109077
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, I notice:

2. Has similar structural elements to O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C from the training set (which had value -1644.96924724)
3. The main difference is the replacement of methyl group with a larger C(C)CCC group
4. Contains similar functional groups (C=C, NC(=O))

Given that:
- The base structure is very similar to the training example
- The additional alkyl chain would make it slightly more positive
- The cyclic uracil core tends to contribute to negative values
- The presence of multiple oxygen atoms in similar arrangements tends to push toward negative values

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-1589.45

This value is slightly higher (less negative) than the similar training molecule (-1644.97) due to the larger alkyl substituent, while maintaining the overall negative character of this class of compounds.

3. Has an oxygen in the ring
4. Similar in complexity to the sugar-like molecule in the training set: OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO (-4053.51293918)

Key observations from the training set:
- Molecules with multiple OH groups tend to have large negative values
- Cyclic structures with oxygen tend to contribute to negative values
- The more oxygen atoms present, the more negative the value tends to be
- Similar sugar-like structures show very negative values

Given these patterns and the structural similarity to the sugar molecule in the training set, but noting that this molecule has one less OH group and is cyclic, I would predict a value of approximately:

-3800.45

This prediction takes into account that it should be slightly less negative than the acyclic sugar in the training set due to having fewer OH groups, but still maintaining a very negative value due to its similar oxygen-rich structure.

The target molecule has a very similar core structure but with additional oxygen-containing groups and a double bond in the A-ring, which would modify the value somewhat.

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict the property value for CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C would be approximately:

1590.45

This prediction takes into account the similar steroid core structure but adjusts for the additional functional groups present in the target molecule.

Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and the pattern in the given examples to predict the property value.

The molecule CC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with a tert-butyl group attached to a CH2OH.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
- Simple alcohols tend to have negative values
- The complexity and size of the molecule affects the magnitude
- Similar structures like:
  * CCCCCCC(C)O: -0.95788909
  * CC(C)CO: -1166.09312373
  * CCCC(O)CCC: -267.86684148
  * CCCCC(CC)CO: -98.45731415

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has several key characteristics:
1. It contains multiple chlorine atoms (5 Cl atoms)
2. It has a biphenyl-like structure (two benzene rings connected)
3. The chlorines are distributed across both rings
4. It's a relatively large, conjugated system

Looking at similar structures in the training set:

- Biphenyl-like structures tend to have higher values

Given that our target molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than both reference molecules (5 vs 6-7)
- Similar biphenyl core structure
- Slightly less symmetric arrangement

I would predict a value of approximately 2950.75

This prediction is based on:
1. The value should be lower than 3376 (6 Cl example) but still quite high due to the 5 Cl atoms
2. The biphenyl core contribution
3. The specific substitution pattern of the chlorines

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobromobenzene, where fluorine and bromine are substituted on a benzene ring in different positions.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Halogenated aromatics tend to have moderate to high positive values
2. Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (chlorobromobenzene) has a value of 522.39165638
3. Monohalogenated benzenes like COc1cccc(Cl)c1 have lower values around 6.56838232
4. Bromine substitutions generally contribute to higher positive values

Given that this molecule:
- Has both F and Br substituents (dihalogenated benzene)
- Is structurally similar to chlorobromobenzene but with F instead of Cl
- Fluorine typically has a smaller effect than chlorine

I would predict a value somewhat lower than chlorobromobenzene but still significantly positive.

Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice this is a molecular property prediction task. The target molecule CC/C=C\C is a geometric isomer (Z-isomer) of pent-2-ene, while one of the example molecules CC/C=C/C is the E-isomer of the same compound.

Given that:
1. The E-isomer (CC/C=C/C) has a property value of -250.76167919
2. The target molecule is its Z-isomer (CC/C=C\C)
3. Z/E isomers typically have similar but slightly different properties

- N-containing molecules with carbonyl groups often have negative values
- Complex structures with multiple rings and N atoms typically range from -200 to -600

Considering these factors and the structural similarities with molecules like CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23 (-175.63580641) and other examples containing similar functional groups, I would predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately:

-242.5

This prediction takes into account the presence of two phenyl rings (which typically increases the value) but is moderated by the urea-like core structure and N-methyl group (which tend to contribute to negative values based on the training examples).

Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is a brominated acetanilide. Looking at the training examples, I can observe several relevant patterns:

1. Molecules containing bromine (Br) tend to have values in the moderate positive to negative range
2. Aromatic systems with substituents generally contribute to the property
3. Amide groups (NC(=O)) appear to decrease the value
4. Para-substituted aromatics show specific trends

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of -126.09925641
- Fc1cccc(Br)c1 has a value of 170.50425772

- Contains an acetamide group
- Has a similar size and complexity to several training molecules

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I predict the property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 to be approximately:

True Property: 373.64516509451073
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is an alkylbenzene with an isobutyl group attached to a benzene ring.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethylbenzene with methyl) has value 149.44438191
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (isopropylbenzene with methyl) has value 533.28422373
- Simple aromatics like Cc1cccc2ccccc12 has value 553.67357718

The target molecule has:
1. A benzene ring like these examples

Based on these structural similarities and patterns, and noting that:
- Branching tends to increase the value
- Additional carbons in the alkyl chain also tend to increase the value
- The value seems to scale with molecular size in aromatics

I predict the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 to be approximately:

341.5

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Higher than the ethylbenzene derivative (149.44)
- Lower than the more complex naphthalene derivative (553.67)
- Similar but slightly lower than the isopropyl derivative (533.28) due to similar branching but different connectivity

True Property: -574.6650323436718
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, consisting of:

Given that benzaldehyde:
- Is simpler than salicylamide
- Has one oxygen (like anisole)
- Has a carbonyl group (but simpler than salicylamide)
- Has a similar core structure to these compounds

I would predict a value of approximately: -680.45

This prediction places it between anisole and salicylamide, accounting for the presence of the aldehyde group while considering its relative structural simplicity.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -1550.0698068515158
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my analysis:

1. The molecule contains a furan ring (5-membered oxygen heterocycle) with a nitro group
2. There's a cyclic urea structure (similar to hydantoin)
3. Contains a C=N bond (imine/Schiff base)
4. Has multiple electron-withdrawing groups (nitro, carbonyl)
5. Contains multiple heteroatoms (N, O)

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
- Molecules with nitro groups tend to have higher positive values
- Cyclic structures with multiple heteroatoms often have negative values
- The presence of furan rings and conjugated systems affects the value
- Molecules with similar size and complexity tend to have values in similar ranges

Based on these observations and the structural features, I predict the property value to be approximately:

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 538.1968263382932
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. Molecules with conjugated aromatic systems tend to have higher positive values
2. The presence of N-N bonds appears in some examples
3. The given molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is very similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training set, which has a value of 1206.25604479
4. The only difference is that our target molecule has a single N-N bond instead of a double N=N bond

Given these observations:

1. The molecule has two phenyl rings like many positive-valued examples
2. It's structurally almost identical to the azo compound in the training set
3. The single N-N bond versus double N=N bond would likely reduce the value somewhat compared to the azo analog
4. The overall conjugation would still contribute to a positive value

Based on these considerations and the very close structural similarity to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (1206.25604479), but accounting for the reduced conjugation due to the single N-N bond, I would predict a value of approximately:

1050.8

This prediction takes into account that the property value should be somewhat lower than the azo analog but still significantly positive due to the aromatic systems and N-N linkage.

I would predict a value of approximately 1250-1300 for this molecule, with my best specific estimate being:

1276.45

This takes into account the size increase from dichlorobenzene while being significantly smaller than the pentachlorinated biphenyl derivative in the training set.

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples.

The molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is 1,4-dibromobenzene, which has a benzene ring with two bromine atoms in para position.

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Halogenated benzenes tend to have moderate positive values
2. Similar structures like ClC(Cl)Cl have values around -241
3. Dihalogenated benzenes like Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 have values around 246

5. Symmetric para-substituted structures tend to have more predictable values

Taking into account these patterns and the structural similarity to other halogenated aromatics in the training set, particularly the di-chlorinated benzenes, but adjusting for the presence of bromine atoms instead of chlorine, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

Looking at the given molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, I notice:

1. It contains two chlorine atoms (Cl)
2. Has a hydroxyl group (OH)
3. Contains a pyrimidine ring (cncnc)
4. Has two benzene rings
5. Shows structural similarity to some chlorinated compounds in the training set

Analyzing patterns from the training examples:
- Chlorinated compounds generally have positive values
- Multiple aromatic rings tend to increase the value
- Presence of OH groups tends to decrease the value
- Nitrogen-containing heterocycles often contribute negatively
- Complex structures with multiple ring systems typically have values in the range of 500-2000

Considering these factors:
- The two Cl atoms will contribute positively (approximately +500)
- The OH group will decrease the value (approximately -200)
- The pyrimidine ring will contribute negatively (approximately -300)
- The two benzene rings will contribute positively (approximately +400)

Based on these considerations and the structural similarities to other molecules in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

- Branched structure
- Absence of any functional groups

I predict the property value to be approximately: -156.42
