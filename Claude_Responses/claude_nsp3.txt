SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 0.8543549620036873
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule appears to be a steroid-like structure with:
- Multiple ring systems (4 rings)
- Contains ketone groups (C=O)
- Has hydroxyl group (OH)
- Contains aliphatic carbons
- Similar to some of the complex cyclic structures in the training set

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C has a value of 0.85435496
- This is also a steroid-like structure with similar features

The target molecule shares structural similarities with this steroid example, but has additional oxygen-containing groups (hydroxyl and ketone). Based on the patterns observed in the training set:
- Oxygen-containing groups tend to slightly decrease the value
- Complex cyclic structures tend to have values in the 0.2 to 0.9 range
- Additional polar groups typically lower the value somewhat

Taking all these factors into consideration, I would predict a value of approximately 0.75 for this molecule.

- Molecules with urea-like groups (like CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O) have values around 0.58455866
- Complex molecules with mixed aromatics and halogens generally fall in the negative range

Given the structural similarity to both halogenated aromatics and urea-containing compounds, but with more complexity, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.35972841

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has features common to both highly negative value compounds (halogenated aromatics) and more positive value compounds (urea-like structures), leading to an intermediate negative value similar to other complex heterocyclic compounds in the training set.

2. Molecules with fused aromatic rings generally have more negative values
3. Simple aliphatic molecules tend to have more positive values (around 1.21)

Given that this is a simple biphenyl structure:
- It's more complex than a single benzene ring
- It's simpler than fused ring systems (which show more negative values around -0.67)
- It's similar to other conjugated aromatic systems in the training set

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.25

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has some aromatic character but is not as complex as the highly negative valued polycyclic aromatics, while being more complex than the simple positive-valued aliphatic compounds.

- Looking at other molecules with sulfur in the training set (like COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O) which has a value of 0.58455866

Given these observations and the molecule's relatively simple structure but with a sulfur atom, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.85 - 0.90

My best specific prediction would be: 0.87634521

This takes into account that it should be lower than the typical alkane value (1.21408337) due to the sulfur, but higher than more complex sulfur-containing compounds in the training set.

These molecules are very similar to our target molecule in terms of:
- Multiple chlorine substitutions
- Biphenyl core structure
- Similar molecular size and complexity

Given the strong structural similarities between the target molecule and these training examples, and the consistent property value they show, I predict the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl to be:

-0.67449076

This prediction is based on the clear pattern that similar polychlorinated biphenyl structures consistently show this exact value in the training set.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O - nitropropane) and compare it with the patterns I observe in the training examples:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple alkyl chains (like CCC) tend to have values around 1.2
- Presence of N(=O)=O groups tends to decrease the value
- Molecules with similar size and polarity tend to have values between 0.2 and 0.9
- The nitro group typically reduces the value compared to pure hydrocarbons

Considering these patterns and the molecule's characteristics:
- It has a short alkyl chain (propyl)
- Contains one nitro group
- Relatively small molecule
- Has some polarity due to the nitro group

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately 0.85 for CCCN(=O)=O.

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The base propyl chain would suggest a higher value (like 1.2)
2. The nitro group would reduce this value
3. The overall size and polarity would place it in the moderate range

Therefore, my predicted value is: 0.85

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.9780116012410629

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple alkanes (like CCCCC) tend to have values around 1.21408337
2. Esters generally have values between 0.8 and 1.2
3. Medium-length chains with oxygen-containing functional groups often show values around 1.0

Considering these factors:
- The molecule has similar structural elements to CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC which has a value of 1.02522595
- It's slightly shorter than that molecule but maintains the ester functionality
- The overall polarity and size are in a similar range

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for CCCCCC(=O)OCC to be approximately:

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.4384189936597869
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns that can help predict the property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate):

1. This molecule is structurally very similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) which has a value of -0.25480762

2. The only difference is that our target molecule has a methyl ester (COC(=O)-) instead of an ethyl ester (CCOC(=O)-)

3. Looking at other similar compounds with aromatic rings and ester groups, they tend to have values in the negative range between -0.2 and -0.3

4. The presence of the benzoate group seems to be a key structural feature that leads to these negative values

5. The methyl vs ethyl difference typically doesn't cause major changes in this property

Based on these observations, and particularly the very close structural similarity to ethyl benzoate, I would predict that COC(=O)c1ccccc1 would have a property value of approximately:

-0.25480762

This prediction is based on the extremely close structural similarity to ethyl benzoate, with the expectation that the methyl vs ethyl difference would not significantly alter the property value in this case.

   - Simple alkenes tend to have moderate positive values
   - The molecule is similar in size and structure to CC/C=C/C but has an additional double bond

Given these observations, I would predict that C=CCC=C would have a value slightly lower than CC/C=C/C (0.45865372) due to the additional unsaturation, but still positive due to its small size and hydrocarbon nature.

My prediction for C=CCC=C would be approximately 0.35 to 0.40.

To be more specific, I'll predict: 0.37

Considering all these factors and the overall molecular complexity, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.25

This prediction takes into account the competing effects of the various structural features present in the molecule, with the negative contribution of the chlorinated aromatic system being partially offset by the positive contributions of the N-dimethyl and tert-butyl groups.

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.4586537164440847
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice that this molecule (CC/C=C\C) is very similar to CC/C=C/C which has a property value of 0.45865372. The only difference is the stereochemistry of the double bond (cis vs trans).

Given that:
1. The molecules are constitutional isomers (same molecular formula, different arrangement)
2. They only differ in the stereochemistry of the double bond
3. The overall size and basic structure remains the same
4. Most similar molecules in the training set tend to have similar values

I would predict that the property value for CC/C=C\C would be very close to its trans isomer, approximately:

0.45865372

The stereochemistry change typically doesn't cause dramatic changes in many chemical properties, and looking at other examples in the dataset, similar structures tend to have similar values. Therefore, I would expect this cis-isomer to have essentially the same value as its trans counterpart.

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CCCOCC is a relatively simple aliphatic ether molecule with:
- A linear carbon chain
- An oxygen atom in the middle
- No cyclic structures
- No aromatic rings
- No other functional groups

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple aliphatic molecules (like C, CC(C)O, CCC(O)CC) tend to have values around 1.21408337
2. Molecules with oxygen but still mainly aliphatic (like CC(C)COC(=O)C) have values around 0.89932101
3. The presence of an ether group seems to slightly lower the value compared to pure alkanes

Given these observations and the structural similarity to other aliphatic molecules in the training set, while accounting for the ether functionality, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.89932101

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is primarily aliphatic (which would suggest a higher value near 1.21) but the presence of the ether linkage likely reduces the value somewhat, similar to other oxygen-containing aliphatic molecules in the training set.

The target molecule seems to fall between these examples, but is most similar structurally to the first and third examples. Given the presence of two phenyl rings (which tends to lower the value) but also the branched aliphatic portion (which tends to increase the value), I would predict a value of:

-0.10791852

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has features that would both increase and decrease the property value, landing it in a moderate negative range.

- Other substituted benzenes generally have negative values

The target molecule is most structurally similar to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1, but with one less methyl group on the benzene ring. The presence of the isobutyl group (CC(C)C-) makes it slightly more lipophilic than simple alkylbenzenes.

Based on these patterns and the similarity to other aromatic compounds in the dataset, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.08093889

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The molecule has similar branching to other examples
2. It contains a benzene ring like many other molecules in the dataset
3. The value tends to be slightly positive for branched alkylbenzenes
4. The structural similarity to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 suggests it would have a similar property value

Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the target molecule, I notice several patterns:

1. The target molecule contains multiple chlorine substituents and a biphenyl core structure
2. Similar molecules in the training set include:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (-0.67449076)

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.4586537164440847
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is 2-methylbut-2-ene, a small alkene with branching.

Looking at the patterns in the training set:
1. Small molecules tend to have values between -0.2 and 1.0
2. Presence of double bonds tends to slightly lower the value compared to fully saturated analogs
3. Branched alkanes/alkenes tend to have slightly higher values than their linear counterparts
4. The molecule is similar in size and structure to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

Considering these factors:
- It's a small molecule (5 carbons)
- Has one double bond
- Has branching (2 methyl groups)
- Similar to molecules like CCCCC but with unsaturation

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.65

This prediction takes into account that it should have a value:
- Lower than fully saturated alkanes (which are around 1.2)
- Higher than aromatic compounds (which are generally negative)
- Similar to other small alkenes but slightly higher due to branching

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.3674811724044898
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my reasoning:

1. The molecule contains multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters, hydroxyl groups)
2. It has a complex polycyclic structure with multiple rings
3. It contains both aromatic and aliphatic regions
4. It has similarities to some of the larger, more complex molecules in the training set that contain sugar-like moieties and multiple ring systems

Looking at the training examples:
- Simpler molecules with just hydrocarbon chains tend to have values around 1.21
- Complex molecules with multiple rings and oxygen-containing groups tend to have values between 0.3 and 0.9
- The presence of sugar-like moieties (as in some examples) tends to push values higher
- Natural product-like structures with multiple rings and oxygenated functionalities often have values in the 0.6-0.9 range

Given the structural complexity, presence of multiple oxygen-containing groups, and similarity to natural product-like molecules in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.85435496

This prediction is based on the similarity of this molecule to other complex, multi-ring oxygenated structures in the training set that showed values in this range.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.5058680696074463
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A heterocyclic ring structure with nitrogen atoms
- A thioether (CS-) group
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)
- An amino substituent (-N)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a value of 0.64751113
- This is particularly relevant as it also contains an nnc ring system and a tert-butyl group

Other relevant patterns:
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings containing N atoms tend to have values in the range of 0.3 to 0.7
- The presence of sulfur and nitrogen-containing functional groups often leads to moderate positive values

Based on these observations and the structural similarities, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.58 for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.2548076202467138
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate (an aromatic ester).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings generally tend to have negative values
2. However, esters (C(=O)O) typically show positive values (like CCCCCC(=O)OC at 0.94428706)
3. The presence of the ethoxy group (CCOC) combined with aromatic ring creates a balance
4. Similar compounds in the training set with both aromatic and ester functionalities tend to have values around 0.2 to 0.9

Based on these observations and considering the structural similarities with other molecules in the training set, I would predict the property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 to be approximately:

0.20684383

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of the aromatic ring (which typically reduces the value)
- The ester group (which typically increases the value)
- The overall size and complexity of the molecule
- Similar structural patterns seen in the training data

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl bromide (1-bromoheptane).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple linear molecules tend to have positive values
2. Halogenated compounds can vary, but aliphatic halides tend to be more positive than aromatic halides
3. Longer chain alkanes/alkyl derivatives generally have values between 0.7 and 1.2
4. The closest analogous structures in the training set are:
   - CCCCCCCO (1.21408337)
   - CCCCCCC=C (0.74193984)
   - CCCCCC(=O)C (0.94428706)

Given that:
- It's a linear molecule like the examples above
- It has a similar chain length
- The bromine will have some effect but likely not as dramatic as in aromatic systems
- The value should be between the more polar alcohol (1.21) and the alkene (0.74)

I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately 0.85

This takes into account both the linear nature of the molecule and the moderate electronic effect of the bromine substituent.

Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CO (methanol) is a very simple molecule with:
- One carbon atom
- One oxygen atom (alcohol group)
- Similar in simplicity to molecules like CCC (propane)
- Small, simple alcohols appear to have relatively high positive values in the training set
- Looking at examples like CCC(C)CO and other simple alcohols, they tend to have values around 1.2

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, particularly noting how simple molecules with alcohol groups behave, I would predict the property value for CO (methanol) to be approximately:

1.21408337

This prediction is based on:
1. The molecule's small size and simplicity
2. The presence of an alcohol group
3. Its similarity to other simple molecules in the training set that show this value
4. The pattern that simple alcohols and small molecules tend to have higher positive values in this property scale
