SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 3.3001000000000023
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (methyl decanoate) and predict its property value by comparing it to similar structures in the training examples and considering key molecular features:

1. It's a medium-length fatty acid methyl ester with 10 carbons in the main chain
2. Has similar structural elements to CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl dodecanoate) which has a value of 4.0803
3. This molecule is shorter by two carbons than the reference
4. Looking at other patterns in the training set:
   - Increasing chain length generally increases the value
   - Ester groups tend to slightly decrease the value compared to pure hydrocarbons
   - The property appears to correlate with lipophilicity

Considering these factors, and that this molecule would be slightly less lipophilic than methyl dodecanoate (4.0803) due to having two fewer carbons, I would predict:

3.6803

This prediction takes into account that each CH2 reduction typically reduces the property by approximately 0.2 units in similar compounds, and the overall molecular properties are very similar to the longer-chain reference compound.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 1.7744999999999997
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 has:
- A benzoxazolone core structure
- One chlorine substituent
- A fused bicyclic system
- Both aromatic and heterocyclic components
- Polar groups (C=O, NH)

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Molecules with similar size typically have property values between 1-3
2. Chlorinated aromatics tend to increase the value
3. Presence of heterocycles with oxygen and nitrogen typically moderates the value
4. Fused ring systems generally contribute to higher values
5. The presence of polar groups like C=O and NH tends to decrease the value somewhat

Considering these factors:
- The molecule is relatively compact
- Has one chlorine on an aromatic ring
- Contains a moderately polar heterocyclic system
- Has a fused bicyclic structure
- Contains both O and NH groups which reduce lipophilicity

Based on these considerations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately 2.1

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has features that would both increase the property (chlorine, fused rings) and decrease it (polar groups), leading to a moderate value.

Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.6715
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (isopropyl nitrite, CC(C)N(=O)=O) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice that:
1. Smaller molecules generally have lower values
2. Molecules with nitrogen-oxygen groups (N=O, NO2) tend to have lower values
3. Simple aliphatic molecules with similar size have values around 1-2
4. The presence of polar groups tends to decrease the value

For CC(C)N(=O)=O:
- It's a relatively small molecule
- Contains a nitrite group (N=O)
- Has a simple branched alkyl group (isopropyl)
- Similar in size to some of the smaller molecules in the training set
- Has some polarity due to the N=O group

Comparing to similar molecules in the training set:
- Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO has a value of 0.09202
- Simple aliphatic molecules like CCCOCC have values around 1.4
- Small molecules with nitrogen and oxygen typically have values below 1

Based on these observations, I predict the property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O to be approximately:

1.02

This prediction takes into account the molecule's small size, the presence of the nitrite group, and its similarity to other molecules in the training set.

Iteration: 4
SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 2.666700000000002
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the given molecule (CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO), I notice:

1. It's a complex steroid-like structure
2. Contains multiple ring systems (4 fused rings)
3. Has oxygen-containing functional groups (ketone, hydroxyl)
4. Has a relatively complex 3D structure
5. Contains multiple chiral centers
6. Similar in complexity to the steroid-like structure in the training set: CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C (which had a value of 4.7235)

Considering these factors:
- The overall size and complexity is similar to other steroidal structures
- The presence of polar groups (OH, C=O) will slightly decrease the value compared to purely hydrocarbon structures
- The multiple ring system will contribute to a higher value
- The molecule has similar polarity distribution to other examples

Based on these considerations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

3.9824

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly more polar than the similar steroid structure in the training set (4.7235) due to the additional hydroxyl and ketone groups, which would lower the value somewhat, but still maintains the complex ring structure that contributes to a relatively high value.

True Property: 3.5801000000000016
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

Looking at the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, I notice:

1. It contains a urea linkage (-NC(=O)NC(=O)-)
2. Has two fluorine atoms on one benzene ring
3. Has a chlorine atom on the other benzene ring
4. Contains two aromatic rings
5. Has polar groups (C=O, NH)

Analyzing similar structures from the training set:
- Compounds with urea groups like C1SC(=S)NC1(=O) and CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O have relatively low values (0.1343 and 0.4048)
- Chlorobenzenes typically contribute around 2.5-3.0 to the property
- Multiple halogens tend to increase the value
- The presence of polar groups like C=O and NH tends to decrease the value

Considering these factors:
- The two aromatic rings would contribute positively
- The halogens (2F, 1Cl) would contribute positively
- The polar urea linkage would decrease the value
- The overall polarity would moderate the value

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately 2.8 for this molecule.

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 1.8214000000000001
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCOC(C)C - propyl 2-propyl ether) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. The property appears to correlate with lipophilicity/hydrophobicity
2. Longer alkyl chains tend to increase the value
3. Oxygen atoms tend to slightly decrease the value
4. The values generally range from -3.5 to 5.3
5. Simple aliphatic ethers and alcohols typically have values between 1-2.5

For CCCOC(C)C:

- Similar compounds in the training set:
  * CCOC(=O)CC (0.9595)
  * CC1CCCO1 (1.1853)
  * CCCCCO (1.1689)
  * CCCCCC(O)CC (2.3376)

Considering these factors and the structural features, I predict the property value for CCCOC(C)C to be approximately:

1.65

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate chain length, branching, and the presence of one oxygen atom.

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 1.5785200000000001
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

The target molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O has several key features:
1. A heterocyclic ring structure with two nitrogen atoms
2. Two carbonyl groups (C=O)
3. A bromine substituent
4. Alkyl groups (ethyl and methyl)
5. Moderate molecular weight
6. Some polarity due to the N, O, and Br atoms
7. Moderate lipophilicity due to the alkyl groups

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with heterocycles typically have values between 1-3
- Bromine-containing compounds like CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 have values around 2.4
- Molecules with similar size and polarity tend to fall in the 2-3 range

Taking into account all these factors, and comparing with the overall pattern in the training set, I would predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately:

2.31

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate size, the presence of the bromine atom, the heterocyclic structure, and the balance between polar and nonpolar groups.
==================================================
Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 3.353600000000002
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (biphenyl - two benzene rings connected directly) and predict its property value by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. The property generally increases with:
   - More aromatic rings
   - More carbons/larger molecules
   - More hydrophobic groups
2. It decreases with:
   - Polar groups (OH, NH2)
   - Highly oxygenated compounds

For biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2):
- It has two benzene rings directly connected
- It's purely aromatic
- No polar substituents
- Similar to simpler examples in the dataset
- More hydrophobic than single ring structures
- Less complex than multi-ring fused systems

Comparing to similar structures:
- Single benzene derivatives have values around 2-3
- Two-ring systems typically show values around 3-4
- The molecule is simpler than many complex PAHs in the dataset

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the example data, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

3.2

This takes into account its intermediate size, aromaticity, and lack of polar substituents, placing it between single-ring and more complex multi-ring systems in the training set.

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 1.7163
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (CCCCS - butanethiol) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features.

Key observations:
1. This is a relatively simple, linear molecule
2. It contains a sulfur atom at the end of a 4-carbon chain

   - CCCC(C)(C)C (2.8326)
   - Simple linear molecules tend to have values between 2-3.5
   - The presence of sulfur typically increases the value slightly compared to pure hydrocarbons

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value for CCCCS to be approximately:

This prediction takes into account:
- The molecule's relatively small size
- The presence of the sulfur atom
- The linear chain structure
- Comparison to similar molecules in the training set

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1.8050000000000002
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with:
- A 4-carbon main chain
- Two methyl groups (C) branching
- A hydroxyl group (OH) at the end
- Total of 7 carbons

Looking at similar structures from the examples:
- CCCC(C)(C)C (2.4425) - very similar but with CH3 instead of CH2OH
- CCCC(C)(O)CC (1.9475) - similar branching with OH group
- CC(C)CC(C)O (1.4133) - another branched alcohol
- CCCCOC (1.4329) - similar length but different oxygen position

The target molecule should have a property value between these reference molecules, but closer to CCCC(C)(O)CC since it's most similar in terms of both carbon skeleton and functional group position.

The presence of the hydroxyl group typically reduces the value compared to pure hydrocarbons, but the branching and carbon chain length will keep it moderately high.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO to be approximately:

1.85

This takes into account:
- The similar branching pattern to CCCC(C)(C)C
- The reducing effect of the hydroxyl group
- The overall molecular size and structure
- The patterns observed in other alcohols in the training set

Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 3.148220000000001
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule "Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1" (methylnaphthalene), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1. This molecule is structurally similar to several examples in the training set, particularly:
- "Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12" (dimethylnaphthalene, 3.45664)
- "c1ccccc1" (benzene, 1.6866)
- "Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1" (methylanthracene, 4.30142)

2. The target molecule is a naphthalene with one methyl group, making it less complex than methylanthracene but more complex than benzene.

3. Compared to dimethylnaphthalene (3.45664), it should have a slightly lower value as it has one less methyl group.

4. The property appears to increase with:
- More aromatic rings
- More substituents
- Greater molecular size

Based on these patterns, I would predict the property value for methylnaphthalene (Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1) to be approximately:

2.95

This prediction places it:
- Higher than benzene (1.6866)
- Lower than dimethylnaphthalene (3.45664)
- Significantly lower than methylanthracene (4.30142)
- Consistent with the general trend of how aromatic systems and alkyl substitutions affect the property

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 1.3510999999999993
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features.

The target molecule is a barbiturate derivative with:
- A barbituric acid core (similar to O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C in the examples)
- An additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) at the same position where the previous example had just a methyl group
- A CC=C group similar to the simpler example

Looking at the most similar molecule from the examples:
O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a value of -0.0652

The target molecule has a longer alkyl chain which would typically increase the property value due to increased hydrophobicity. However, the barbituric acid core is quite polar and dominates the overall property.

Considering these factors:
- The base barbiturate structure's contribution
- The slight increase due to longer alkyl chain
- The CC=C group contribution
- The overall polarity of the molecule

I predict the property value would be approximately 0.4500

This prediction takes into account that the longer alkyl chain would increase the value somewhat from the -0.0652 of the similar example, but the polar barbituric acid core would still keep the overall value relatively low.
==================================================
Iteration: 13
SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 2.705400000000001
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (trifluoromethylbenzene) and predict its property value based on the training examples provided. Looking at the patterns in the given data:

1. The molecule contains a benzene ring (similar to many examples)
2. It has a CF3 (trifluoromethyl) substituent
3. It's relatively small and compact
4. It has both aromatic and fluorinated components

Analyzing similar structures and their values:
- Simple benzene derivatives tend to have values between 1.5-3.0
- Halogenated compounds (like Clc1ccc(I)cc1 at 2.9446) tend to be higher than their non-halogenated counterparts
- The CF3 group typically contributes to increased lipophilicity, but less than larger alkyl chains

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 to be approximately:

2.4

This prediction takes into account that the CF3 group would increase the value compared to benzene alone, but not as much as longer alkyl chains or multiple halogens spread across the ring.

SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -3.2214000000000005
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples and analyzing the given molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, I can make several observations:

1. This molecule appears to be a sugar (carbohydrate) structure with multiple hydroxyl groups
2. It's similar in nature to OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO from the training set, which has a value of -3.5854
3. Both molecules have:
   - Multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups
   - A similar carbon backbone
   - Similar polarity characteristics
   - Cyclic structure (in the query molecule) vs linear structure (in the reference)

The query molecule has:
- 6 oxygen atoms
- Multiple hydroxyl groups
- A cyclic structure
- Similar hydrophilic characteristics

Based on these observations and the strong structural similarity to the reference sugar molecule, I would predict a value around -3.2 to -3.4 for this molecule. 

My specific prediction is: -3.35

This prediction takes into account that the cyclic structure might make it slightly less polar than the linear sugar in the training set, but still maintains the highly hydrophilic character that results in a strongly negative value for this property.

- Similar core structure to some of the training examples, particularly those with steroid backbones

2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C has a value of 4.8401
- CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C has a value of 4.2693

3. Key differences in our target molecule:
- Has additional oxygen-containing groups
- Has an unsaturated ketone system
- Has multiple hydroxyl groups

4. These modifications would likely:
- Slightly decrease the value due to increased polarity from additional oxygen atoms
- But maintain relatively high value due to the large steroid backbone

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

4.1

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to other steroids in the training set while accounting for the increased polarity from additional oxygen-containing groups.

- A ketone group
- Multiple rings
- Mostly aliphatic carbons

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O has a value of 3.6092
- Other complex polycyclic structures tend to have values between 3-4
- The presence of hydroxyl and ketone groups typically reduces the value slightly compared to pure hydrocarbons

Considering these factors:
1. The molecule's complexity and size is similar to other steroids
2. It has polar groups (OH and C=O) which slightly reduce the value
3. The overall structure is predominantly hydrophobic
4. It's slightly less aromatic than some of the reference steroids

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

3.45

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to other steroids while considering the slight differences in functional groups and overall polarity.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is acetanilide with a nitro group para to the acetamido group.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with nitro groups (NO2) tend to have values around 1.5-2.0 (e.g., O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 has 1.5948)
2. The presence of an acetamido group (NH(C=O)CH3) typically reduces the value slightly compared to simple nitrobenzenes
3. Para-substitution pattern appears to have moderate effects on the property
4. The molecule has both polar groups (NO2 and NHCOCH3) which would affect its properties

Considering these factors and comparing to similar structures in the training set, particularly nitrobenzene (1.5948) and other aromatic compounds with polar substituents, I would predict the property value to be:

1.39

This prediction takes into account that the acetamido group would likely reduce the value somewhat compared to simple nitrobenzene, but the overall molecular structure would still maintain a moderate value for this property.

1. The molecule contains several key structural features:
- Phosphorothioate group (P=S)
- Chlorine substituent
- Benzofuran ring system
- Multiple oxygen and sulfur atoms
- Ethoxy groups

2. Looking at patterns from the examples:
- Molecules with halogens (Cl) typically have higher values (2.5-4.5)
- Complex heterocyclic structures tend to increase the value
- Presence of sulfur atoms generally contributes to higher values
- Multiple oxygen atoms moderate the value somewhat
- The size and complexity of the molecule suggests a higher value

3. Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- Complex heterocyclic structures with halogens like Clc1cccc2ccccc12 has 3.4932
- Molecules with similar complexity and heteroatoms tend to fall in the 3-4 range
- The phosphorothioate group will likely increase the value further

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I predict the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 to be approximately:

3.85

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, presence of halogens, heterocyclic system, and multiple heteroatoms while considering the general trends observed in the training set.

SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1.0248
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol (t-butanol with a CH2OH group).

Looking at similar alcohols in the training set:
- CC(C)CO (isopropanol) = 0.6347
- CCCCC(CC)CO = 2.1951
- CCCC(O)CCC = 1.9475
- CCCCCCCC(C)O = 2.7277

Key observations:
1. The property appears to increase with carbon chain length
2. Branching tends to slightly decrease the value compared to linear chains
3. The molecule in question is relatively small and branched
4. It's most similar structurally to CC(C)CO but with one additional methyl group

Given these patterns and considering:
- It's slightly larger than isopropanol (0.6347)
- But more branched than linear alcohols
- Has similar polarity characteristics to other small alcohols
- The branching will reduce the value compared to a linear 5-carbon alcohol

I predict the property value to be approximately 0.93

This takes into account that it should be higher than isopropanol due to the additional methyl group, but lower than longer chain alcohols due to its compact, branched structure.

Given that:
- This is a small molecule with an ester group
- It has a branched isopropyl group
- It's slightly smaller than CCCOC(C)C but larger than CC(C)O
- The formate group would contribute to slightly lower values than larger esters

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for CC(C)OC=O to be approximately:

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 3.2578000000000014
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (fluorene), I can make a prediction based on these observations:

1. The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with three fused rings
2. It's similar in structure to some of the other PAHs in the training set
3. Looking at similar structures:
- c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 (pentacene) has a value of 5.1462
- Simple aromatics like CCCc1ccccc1 have lower values (2.6391)
- The property appears to increase with more fused rings and overall molecular size

Given that fluorene:
- Has fewer fused rings than pentacene
- Is more complex than simple aromatics
- Has a rigid, planar structure
- Contains no polar groups

I would predict the property value to be approximately 3.9

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The value should be higher than simple aromatics
2. Lower than pentacene
3. The fused ring system contributes significantly to the property
4. The lack of polar substituents suggests moderate to high lipophilicity

Therefore, my predicted value for C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 is 3.9

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -0.5594299999999999
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, I notice:
1. It contains a sulfonamide group -S(=O)(=O)-
2. Has multiple amino groups (-NH2)
3. Contains a para-substituted benzene ring
4. Has polar groups that can form hydrogen bonds
5. Is relatively small and contains hydrophilic groups

Comparing to similar molecules in the training set:
- It's more polar than most of the highly positive value compounds
- Contains nitrogen-rich groups similar to some of the negative value compounds
- Has structural elements that typically contribute to lower values
- The presence of multiple polar groups and hydrogen bond donors/acceptors typically reduces the property value

Based on these observations and patterns from the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.8

This prediction takes into account that:
- The molecule is more polar than most high-value compounds
- It's less polar than the very negative value compounds
- The aromatic ring provides some positive contribution
- The multiple polar groups and ability to form hydrogen bonds reduces the value
- It's structurally more similar to compounds in the 0.5-1.5 range

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 3.9242000000000035
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, I notice:

1. It contains nitro groups (N(=O)=O)
2. Has a trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)
3. Contains an alkene group (C=C)
4. Has a tertiary amine structure
5. Contains an aromatic ring with multiple substituents

Analyzing similar structures from the training set:
- Molecules with nitro groups tend to have values around 1.3-3.0
- The presence of fluorine atoms typically increases the value
- Multiple heavy substituents on aromatic rings increase the value
- Tertiary amines contribute to increasing the value

Considering all these structural features and their contributions:
- The two nitro groups will contribute significantly
- The trifluoromethyl group will increase lipophilicity
- The tertiary amine with an unsaturated substituent adds to the value
- The overall size and complexity of the molecule suggests a higher value

Based on these considerations and comparing with similar molecules in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately 3.45

Iteration: 26
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.5678
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (isopropyl formate, CC(C)OC=O) and predict its property value by comparing it with similar structures from the training examples and considering key molecular features.

Key observations:
1. It's a small ester molecule
2. Contains a formate group (OC=O)
3. Has branching (isopropyl group)
4. Similar in size to some of the smaller molecules in the training set

Looking at similar molecules from the examples:
- CC(C)CCOC=O (isoamyl formate) has value 1.2055
- CCCCCOC(=O)C (amyl acetate) has value 1.7397
- Simple branched alcohols like CC(C)(C)O have values around 1.1673

The target molecule is:
- Smaller than isoamyl formate
- Has similar polarity to the reference esters
- Has branching like the reference alcohols
- Should have a value lower than 1.2055 (isoamyl formate) due to smaller size

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CC(C)OC=O to be approximately:

0.95

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a value:
- Lower than isoamyl formate (1.2055) due to smaller size
- Higher than acetamide (-0.5084) due to less polarity
- Similar to but slightly lower than simple aldehydes like butanal (0.9854)

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 2.0090399999999997
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethylphenol (two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a benzene ring).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple phenol (c1ccccc1O) has a value of 1.3922
2. Methylated aromatics tend to increase the value slightly compared to their non-methylated counterparts
3. The presence of hydroxyl groups (-OH) generally keeps values moderate
4. Similar structures like Cc1cccc(N)c1 (methylaniline) has a value of 1.57722

Given that:
- This molecule has two methyl groups (which will increase lipophilicity slightly)
- One hydroxyl group (which provides some polarity)
- The basic aromatic structure is similar to phenol
- The substitution pattern will have some effect

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 to be approximately:

1.82

This prediction takes into account that the value should be:
- Higher than simple phenol (1.3922)
- Similar to but slightly higher than methylaniline (1.57722)
- Lower than highly substituted aromatics
- Influenced by the combined effect of two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 3.6130200000000023
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has several key features:
1. It's an organophosphate structure with P=S group
2. Contains two methoxy groups (OC) attached to phosphorus
3. Has a phenoxy linkage
4. Contains methylthio (SC) and methyl (C) substituents on the benzene ring

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has property 4.652
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has property 4.4941
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has property 4.5429

The target molecule has the same basic organophosphate scaffold but with less electronegative substituents (SC and C instead of Cl, Br, or I). The methylthio group (SC) is less electronegative than halogens but still contributes to lipophilicity. The methyl group is a small lipophilic substituent.

Considering these factors, I would predict the property value to be slightly lower than the halogenated analogs but still in a similar range.

Predicted property value: 4.1

Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 6.620600000000001
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my reasoning:

1. The molecule contains multiple chlorine substituents (5 Cl atoms) on a biphenyl structure
2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (7.274)
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (7.9274)

3. The target molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than these examples (5 vs 6-7)
- Similar biphenyl core structure
- Similar substitution pattern

4. Other relevant patterns from the training data:
- Highly chlorinated molecules tend to have higher values
- Biphenyl structures contribute to higher values
- Each chlorine typically adds roughly 0.8-1.2 to the value

Based on these observations, I would predict a value of approximately 6.2 for this molecule. This is lower than the highly chlorinated biphenyls in the training set (due to fewer chlorines) but still relatively high due to the biphenyl structure and multiple chlorine substituents.
==================================================
Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.6731
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O, propyl nitrite) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a short carbon chain (3 carbons)
2. Contains a nitro group
3. Similar in size to some of the simpler molecules in the training set
4. Has polarity due to the N(=O)=O group
5. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - Simple alkanes (CCC) have values around 1.4-1.5
   - Addition of polar groups typically increases the value slightly
   - Molecules with nitro groups tend to have values between 1-2
   - The molecule size and complexity is relatively low

Based on these considerations and patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

1.91

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's slightly larger than propane (CCC)
- The nitro group adds some contribution
- It's less complex than most aromatic compounds
- Similar small molecules with polar groups tend to have values in this range

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 2.5882000000000005
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule and predict its property value by comparing it to similar structures in the training examples and considering key structural features.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a benzene ring substituted with both fluorine and bromine atoms in different positions.

Looking at similar structures from the examples:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of 3.1025 (chloro and bromo substituents)
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 derivatives have values around 2.3-2.5
- Single bromine compounds like CCCBr have values around 1.7-1.8
- Fluorine-containing aromatics like cc1ccc(F)cc1 have slightly lower values than their chloro analogs

Considering that:
1. Fluorine is less lipophilic than chlorine
2. The molecule still contains a bromine atom which contributes significantly to the property
3. The 1,3-disubstitution pattern is similar to some examples
4. The overall molecular size and substitution pattern

I would predict a value of approximately 2.8 for this molecule. This value is lower than the chloro-bromo analog (3.1025) due to the fluorine substitution, but still relatively high due to the presence of bromine.

Therefore, my predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is 2.8

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 2.1935000000000002
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2:
- It's a bicyclic structure
- Contains an alcohol (OH) group
- Has multiple methyl substituents
- Is relatively compact and saturated
- Has some structural similarity to some of the steroid-like structures in the training set
- Contains no aromatic rings or conjugated systems
- Is moderately lipophilic due to the methyl groups but has some polarity from the OH group

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- It's less complex than the steroid derivatives shown
- Has similar features to CC(C)(C)CO (1.0248) and CCCC(C)(C)O (1.5574)
- Is more complex than simple alcohols but less complex than the larger molecules
- Has a rigid bicyclic framework

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

2.1

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has moderate complexity, some lipophilic character from the methyl groups and ring systems, but also has a polar OH group that would reduce the value compared to purely hydrocarbon structures.

Iteration: 33
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 2.5801000000000007
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value by comparing it to the given examples and considering its structural features.

The target molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
- Two ethoxy groups (OCC)
- A phthalimide ring system
- Similar overall structure to some pesticide/insecticide compounds

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O (3.8782) - Very similar structure, just missing the SCCCl group
- Other compounds with phthalimide-like structures tend to have values around 2-4
- The presence of P=S and ethoxy groups typically increases lipophilicity

Considering these factors:
1. The molecule is slightly less lipophilic than the closest analog due to missing the SCCCl group
2. The core structure suggests moderate lipophilicity
3. The P=S and ethoxy groups contribute to increased property value

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value to be approximately 3.2

This prediction takes into account that removing the SCCCl group from the closest analog would reduce the value somewhat from 3.8782, but the remaining structural features would still maintain a moderately high value.
==================================================
Iteration: 34
SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 1.4844199999999999
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

The molecule "Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C" has several key structural features:
1. A pyrazolone core structure
2. A phenyl substituent
3. Two methyl groups
4. A carbonyl group
5. Two nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic ring

Looking at the training examples:
- Similar heterocyclic compounds with aromatic rings typically have values between 2-3
- The presence of N-phenyl substituents generally contributes to increasing the value
- Carbonyl groups tend to slightly decrease the value
- Multiple nitrogen atoms in the structure tend to moderate the value
- Methyl substituents contribute slightly to increasing the value

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the training set (especially those containing N-heterocycles with phenyl substituents), I would predict the property value to be approximately:

2.31

This prediction takes into account the moderate lipophilicity of the molecule, the presence of the heterocyclic ring system, and the balance between the polar groups (C=O, N atoms) and non-polar groups (methyl, phenyl).

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 2.1298000000000004
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCC(=O)OCC - ethyl hexanoate) and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the patterns in the given examples:
1. The molecule is an ester with a medium-length carbon chain
2. Similar compounds with ester groups (CCOC(=O)N, COC=O) have lower values
3. However, longer alkyl chains (CCCCC) tend to increase the value
4. The presence of the ester group typically reduces the value compared to pure hydrocarbons of similar length

Analyzing similar structures from the examples:
- CCCCC (pentane) has a value of 2.1965
- Simple esters tend to have values between 0 and 1
- Longer chain esters like CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC have a value of 2.91

Given that this molecule (ethyl hexanoate):
- Has a six-carbon chain on one side
- Has an ethyl ester group
- Is shorter than the C9 ester example but longer than the simple esters
- Has similar polarity characteristics

I predict the property value would be approximately 2.13

This takes into account both the contribution of the carbon chain length and the moderating effect of the ester group on the overall property value.
==================================================
Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 1.4732
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (methyl benzoate) and predict its property value by comparing it to similar structures in the training examples and considering key structural features.

Looking at similar compounds from the examples:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) has a value of 1.8633
- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 has a value of 1.5689
- Other aromatic esters show similar ranges

The target molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate) is very similar to ethyl benzoate, just with a methyl ester instead of an ethyl ester. The shorter alkyl chain would make it slightly less lipophilic than the ethyl ester.

Given that ethyl benzoate has a value of 1.8633, and considering that:
1. The methyl group will reduce the value slightly compared to ethyl
2. There are no other substituents affecting the property
3. The core structure remains the same

I predict the property value for methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1) to be approximately 1.6
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 1.7485
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:
1. The property appears to correlate with molecular size and complexity
2. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have values between 1-3
3. Molecules with similar structures have similar values
4. The presence of double bonds slightly increases the value compared to single bonds

For C=CCC=C (1,4-pentadiene):
- It's a small hydrocarbon molecule
- Contains two double bonds
- Similar in size to pentane (C1CCCC1) which has value 1.9505
- Similar to CC/C=C/C (2-pentene) which has value 1.9725
- The additional double bond would likely increase the value slightly compared to 2-pentene

Considering these factors, and comparing with similar molecules in the training set, I predict the property value for C=CCC=C to be approximately:

1.98

This prediction takes into account that it's slightly more unsaturated than 2-pentene but maintains a similar carbon chain length and overall molecular size.
==================================================
Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 2.4547
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (tribromomethane/bromoform - CBr3H) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. The property appears to correlate with molecular size and hydrophobicity
2. Halogenated compounds generally have higher values
3. Similar halogenated methanes in the examples show values around 2-3
4. The presence of multiple halogens increases the value
5. The property might be related to logP (partition coefficient) or a similar physicochemical property

Analyzing CBr3H specifically:
- It has three bromine atoms, which are large, polarizable halogens
- Similar to CCl3H (chloroform) but with heavier halogens
- More hydrophobic than chlorinated analogs
- Relatively small molecule overall compared to many examples
- No complex functional groups

Based on these considerations and comparing to similar structures in the training set (especially halogenated compounds), I predict the property value to be:

2.996

This prediction takes into account that bromine substituents typically contribute more to such properties than chlorine, but the molecule is still relatively small compared to many examples in the training set.

- Two ethoxy groups (CCOP-)
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl)
- A phthalimide ring system

- Chlorinated compounds generally increase the value
- The presence of nitrogen heterocycles and aromatic systems contributes moderately
- The combination of polar and non-polar regions suggests moderate to high lipophilicity

3. Considering structural similarities and patterns from the training data:
- The size and complexity is similar to some molecules in the 3-4 range
- The presence of both polar and non-polar regions
- The chlorine substituent and P=S group will increase the value

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

3.8276

This prediction takes into account the molecule's structural features and their relative contributions to the property as observed in the training examples.

1. The molecule contains several key structural features:
- A dimethylurea moiety (CN(C)C(=O)N-)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring
- A fused heterocyclic system with oxadiazolone
- A tert-butyl group

2. Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Molecules with urea-like structures tend to have moderate values
- Chlorinated aromatics generally increase the value
- Complex heterocyclic systems contribute moderately
- Tert-butyl groups typically increase lipophilicity

3. Comparing with similar molecules from the training set:
- The complexity is similar to some of the mid-range examples
- The polarity from the urea and oxadiazolone would moderate the effect of the lipophilic groups
- The chlorine substituent and tert-butyl group would increase the value

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

2.84

This prediction takes into account the balance between the polar groups (which tend to decrease the value) and the lipophilic groups (which tend to increase the value), while considering the overall molecular complexity.

Iteration: 41
SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 5.144700000000002
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict the property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has:
- A phenoxy linkage between two aromatic rings
- Three chlorine substituents
- One hydroxyl group
- Similar structural elements to some of the training examples

Looking at similar molecules from the examples:
- Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl (2.699) - has 2 chlorines and 1 hydroxyl
- c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2 (4.007) - has biphenyl structure with 1 chlorine
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 (4.6604) - has biphenyl structure with 2 chlorines

The target molecule has:
- More chlorines than the first reference
- Oxygen linkage instead of direct biphenyl connection
- Similar lipophilic character due to chlorines
- Slightly more polar due to the hydroxyl group

Considering these factors and the values from similar structures, I predict the property value would be approximately:

3.8

This prediction takes into account:
- The increased lipophilicity from three chlorines
- The slight polarity contribution from the hydroxyl group
- The oxygen bridge between rings (slightly less lipophilic than direct biphenyl)
- The overall size and structure of the molecule
==================================================
Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 1.9725
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice this is likely predicting a molecular property related to lipophilicity or partition coefficients, given the range and pattern of values.

The query molecule CC/C=C\C is a cis-2-pentene (while CC/C=C/C in the training set is trans-2-pentene).

I notice that:
1. The molecule is identical to one in the training set (CC/C=C/C = 1.9725) except for the stereochemistry
2. Generally, cis and trans isomers have very similar values for most physical properties
3. The cis isomer typically has a slightly lower value than the trans isomer for properties like partition coefficients due to its slightly more compact geometry

Given that the trans isomer has a value of 1.9725, I would predict the cis isomer to have a value very close to but slightly lower than this, approximately:

1.95

This takes into account the typical small difference between cis/trans isomers while staying within the general range seen in the training set for similar small hydrocarbon molecules.

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 1.4329
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

CCCOCC (propyl ethyl ether) is a relatively simple aliphatic ether.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple aliphatic molecules tend to have lower values (0.5-2.0)
2. The presence of oxygen typically reduces the value somewhat compared to pure hydrocarbons
3. Similar length chains (5-6 carbons) like CCCCC show values around 2-3
4. Ethers generally have values slightly lower than corresponding alkanes

Comparing with similar molecules from the examples:
- Simple alkanes (C) have value ~0.6
- Longer chain molecules (CCCCCCC=C) have value ~3.1
- Oxygenated compounds like esters (CC(C)COC(=O)C) have value ~1.2
- Medium length chains with oxygen tend to be in 1.0-2.0 range

Given that CCCOCC:
- Has 5 carbons (medium length chain)
- Contains one oxygen atom
- Has branching
- Is similar in size/polarity to some examples

I predict the property value would be approximately 1.45

This takes into account that it should be:
- Higher than very simple molecules
- Lower than long-chain hydrocarbons
- Similar to other medium-length oxygenated compounds
- Affected by the ether oxygen's polarity

1. The molecule contains:
- Two phenyl rings
- A urea-like structure (N-C(=O)-N)
- Tertiary carbon with two methyl groups
- N-methyl group

2. Looking at similar structures from the examples:
- Molecules with two phenyl rings typically have values around 3-4
- N-containing compounds with aromatic rings like "CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23" has a value of 2.0823
- The presence of polar groups (C=O) tends to decrease the value somewhat
- The molecule has some similarity to other N-containing aromatic compounds in the training set

3. Considering these factors:
- The two phenyl rings will contribute to increasing the value
- The polar urea-like group will decrease it somewhat
- The branching and N-methyl group will have moderate effects

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the example set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

2.8 ± 0.3

This prediction takes into account the balance between the lipophilic character of the phenyl rings and the polar nature of the urea-like group, while considering similar structural patterns in the training set.

- Aniline derivatives (Cc1ccc(N)cc1) have values around 1.5-2
- The acetamide group typically reduces the value slightly compared to simple haloaromatics
- Similar sized molecules with comparable polarity are in the 1.5-2.5 range

Considering these factors and comparing with the most similar structures in the training set:
- Fc1cccc(Br)c1 (2.5882)
- Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 (2.1547)
- Cc1ccc(N)cc1 (1.57722)

I predict the property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 to be approximately 1.8534

This prediction takes into account that the acetamide group would make it slightly more polar than the simple bromoaniline, but the bromine substituent would still contribute to maintaining a moderate value for this property.

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 2.8851000000000013
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, I can analyze that this appears to be a lipophilicity-related property (possibly logP or similar) given the patterns observed where:

1. More aromatic rings and larger molecules tend to have higher values
2. Polar groups (like -OH, -NH2) tend to decrease the value
3. Longer alkyl chains increase the value
4. Branching has a moderate increasing effect

For the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 (isobutylbenzene):
- It has one benzene ring
- It has a branched alkyl chain (isobutyl group)
- No polar groups
- Similar to compounds like ethylbenzene and other alkylbenzenes in the training set

Looking at similar structures in the examples:
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethyltoluene) = 2.55742
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (p-cymene) = 3.11842
- Cc1ccccc1 (toluene) would be lower

Given these comparisons and the structural features, I predict the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 to be approximately:

2.88

This value takes into account that it should be:
- Higher than ethylbenzene
- Similar to but slightly lower than p-cymene
- Higher than toluene
- Reflective of its lipophilic nature and branching

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 1.4990999999999999
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde - O=Cc1ccccc1) and predict its property value by comparing it with the given examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's an aromatic compound with a single benzene ring
2. It has a carbonyl group (aldehyde) directly attached to the benzene ring
3. It's relatively small and has moderate polarity
4. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
   - COc1ccccc1 (anisole) has a value of 1.6952
   - Simple benzene derivatives generally have values between 1-2
   - The aldehyde group would make it slightly more polar than anisole

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

1.48

This prediction takes into account that:
- It should be lower than anisole (1.6952) due to the more polar aldehyde group
- But higher than very polar compounds in the dataset
- The value should reflect its moderate lipophilicity and aromatic character

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.07349999999999995
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains a furan ring (5-membered oxygen heterocycle) with a nitro group
2. It has a cyclic urea structure (hydantoin-like)
3. Contains a hydrazone linkage
4. Has multiple polar groups (C=O, NO2)
5. Contains both aromatic and non-aromatic portions

Looking at the training examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups tend to have moderate values (around 2-4)
- Heterocyclic compounds with polar groups typically have lower values than pure hydrocarbons
- The presence of multiple H-bond acceptors tends to lower the value
- Similar sized molecules with mixed aromatic/polar character often fall in the 1.5-3 range

Considering these factors and comparing to the most similar structures in the training set, particularly other heterocyclic compounds with polar substituents, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

2.14

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate size, mixed polarity, and structural features similar to several training examples while considering the moderating effect of the polar groups on what would otherwise be a more lipophilic structure.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 3.1256000000000013
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training set, which has a value of 4.102. The only difference is that our target molecule has an N-N single bond instead of an N=N double bond.

Key observations:
1. Both molecules have two benzene rings
2. Both have nitrogen atoms connecting the rings
3. The main difference is bond order between nitrogens
4. Single bonds typically reduce the property value slightly compared to double bonds in similar structures

The single bond will make the molecule slightly more flexible and slightly less hydrophobic than its double-bonded analog, which should result in a somewhat lower property value.

Based on these considerations and the similar reference compound, I predict the property value to be approximately:

3.85

This value is slightly lower than 4.102 of the similar compound to account for the single bond between nitrogens instead of a double bond.

- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC has a value of 1.185
- Simple cyclic structures tend to have values between 0-2
- The presence of the spiro cyclopentane ring would increase the value somewhat compared to simpler cyclic imides

Based on these observations and the general trends in the training data, I predict the property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 to be approximately:

1.02

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate size, cyclic nature, and the presence of polar groups while considering the values of similar structures in the training set.

Based on these patterns and considering:
- The presence of three chlorines (more than dichlorobenzene)
- The biphenyl system (more extended than single rings)
- The overall molecular size and hydrophobicity
- Similar structures in the training set

I would predict a property value of approximately 4.2 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that the value should be:
- Higher than dichlorobenzene (2.9934)
- Lower than highly chlorinated compounds like the pentachlorophenyl compound (6.4955)
- In line with other tri-substituted aromatic compounds in the dataset

1) The molecule has:
- A benzene ring as the core structure
- Two ethyl (CC-) substituents in para position
- Similar structural features to CCCCCCc1ccccc1 (which has value 3.8094)

2) Key considerations:
- It's a relatively non-polar molecule

True Property: -0.08379999999999999
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and my understanding of molecular structures.

The target molecule (Sulfanilamide) has the following key features:
1. An aromatic ring (benzene)
2. An amino group (-NH2) directly attached to the ring
3. A sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2) as a para substituent

Looking at the training examples and comparing structural features:
- Molecules with similar size tend to have values between 0 and 2
- Aromatic compounds with polar substituents (like -NH2, -NO2) typically have lower values
- The presence of sulfur-containing groups in some examples suggests moderate values
- Similar molecules with amino groups and other polar substituents (like Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O) have a value of 1.177

Considering these factors:
- The molecule is relatively small
- It has two polar groups (-NH2 and -SO2NH2)
- It's similar in size and polarity to the nitroaniline example
- The sulfonamide group would contribute slightly differently than a nitro group

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value to be approximately 0.89

This prediction takes into account the molecule's polarity, size, and structural similarity to the given examples, particularly the para-substituted aniline derivatives.

True Property: 4.487200000000002
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples. The molecule "c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34" is pyrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Larger PAH structures tend to have higher values

- "c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12" (5.45462)
- "Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32" (4.30142)

Pyrene is smaller than some of the larger PAHs in the examples but larger than the simpler aromatic structures. It's a pure hydrocarbon PAH with four fused rings in a compact arrangement.

Based on these observations and the structure-property relationships evident in the training set, I predict the property value for pyrene to be:

4.88

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Higher than the three-ring PAHs (~4.3)
- Lower than the five-ring PAHs (~5.6-6.5)
- Reflective of its compact, highly conjugated structure

Considering these factors:
- The molecule's size and complexity would push the value up
- However, the presence of 5 hydroxyl groups would significantly decrease it
- The fused ring system would contribute to a moderate increase

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

2.84

This prediction takes into account both the structural complexity that would increase the value and the polar hydroxyl groups that would decrease it.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 1.1689
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (CCCCCO - pentanol) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with longer alkyl chains tend to have higher values
2. Presence of oxygen (especially -OH groups) tends to slightly decrease values compared to pure hydrocarbons
3. Similar molecules in the training set:

- A heterocyclic ring with S and O
- An amide group (-C(=O)N-)
- A sulfone group (S(=O)(=O))
- A phenyl ring
- Several methyl/methylene groups

- Presence of sulfur and oxygen typically reduces the value compared to pure hydrocarbons
- Amide groups tend to reduce the value (as seen in acetamide derivatives)
- The overall polarity of the molecule due to S(=O)(=O) and C(=O)N groups will reduce the value

3. Considering these factors and comparing to molecules of similar size and functionality in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

2.1

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has some lipophilic character from the aromatic ring and methyl groups, but also significant polar groups that would moderate the value. The presence of the sulfone and amide groups would keep the value in a moderate range, similar to other molecules with mixed polar/nonpolar character in the training set.

2. Contains multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)
3. Contains nitrogen atoms
4. Relatively small and compact molecule
5. Has some polarity due to the C=O and N-H groups
6. No aromatic rings or halogens

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:

SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 1.2451
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (ClCC - chloroethane) and predict its property value by comparing it with the given examples and considering its structural features:

Key observations:
1. This is a very small aliphatic molecule with a chlorine substituent
2. Looking at similar simple structures in the training set:

- Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) = 2.34
- C1CC=CC1 (cyclopentene) = 1.7265
- CC#N (acetonitrile) = 0.52988

The target molecule (ClCC) is smaller than pentane and chlorobenzene, but the chlorine will increase the value compared to a simple hydrocarbon. It's also simpler than chlorobenzene where the chlorine is attached to an aromatic ring.

Based on these comparisons and the apparent trend that:
- Smaller molecules generally have lower values
- Chlorine substitution increases the value
- The property appears to be related to lipophilicity/hydrophobicity

I would predict the property value for ClCC (chloroethane) to be approximately:

1.65

This value takes into account that it should be:

   - ClC(Cl)Cl has a value of 2.0289
   - Other polychlorinated compounds show higher values
   - The presence of nitrogen in the ring might slightly decrease the value compared to pure carbon aromatics

Considering these factors, and comparing with similar molecules in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately 3.2 for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl.

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of four chlorine atoms (increasing effect)
- The nitrogen in the aromatic ring (slightly decreasing effect)
- The overall size and structure of the molecule
- Comparison with similar chlorinated aromatic compounds in the training set

Key observations:
1. The property appears to correlate with lipophilicity
2. Longer carbon chains increase the value
3. Alcohols generally have values between 1-2
4. Branching slightly decreases the value compared to linear chains
5. The target molecule is most similar to CCC(C)CCO in terms of size and branching

Given that CCCCC(C)O is very similar to CCC(C)CCO (both C6 branched alcohols) which has a value of 1.4149, and considering the slight differences in branching position, I would predict the property value to be:

1.45 ± 0.05

This prediction takes into account that the branching is at a different position but maintains similar overall molecular characteristics.

True Property: 3.2116000000000007
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided. The molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is 1,4-dibromobenzene, which has two bromine atoms at para positions on a benzene ring.

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Similar halogenated benzenes are present in the training set
2. Chlorinated benzenes typically show values between 2.5-4.5
3. Bromine substituents typically lead to slightly higher values than chlorine due to their greater size and lipophilicity
4. The para-substitution pattern is similar to some examples in the training set

Comparing specifically to similar structures:
- Chlorinated benzenes in the training set
- The symmetrical nature of the molecule
- The presence of two halogen substituents

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 to be approximately 3.79

1. The molecule contains multiple chlorine atoms (6 Cls) attached to a biphenyl structure
2. It's similar in structure to "Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" which has a value of 9.8876, but has fewer chlorines
3. The molecule is highly halogenated and has a biphenyl core, suggesting it would have high lipophilicity
4. Comparing to other chlorinated aromatics in the training set
5. The structure suggests it would have a value lower than 9.8876 (which had 10 Cls) but still quite high due to its 6 Cls and biphenyl structure

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, I predict the property value would be approximately:

7.2

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of 6 chlorines (vs 10 in the similar structure)
- The biphenyl core structure
- The relative positions of the chlorines
- The general trend that more halogens increase this property value
- The similarity to other chlorinated aromatic compounds in the dataset

- The overall structure is very similar to the first reference (3.8792)

Considering these factors:
- The base steroid structure suggests a value around 3.8

2. Contains multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters)
3. Has a methylenedioxy group (OCO)
4. Contains multiple rings including aromatic and aliphatic systems
5. Has hydroxyl groups
6. Contains methoxy substituents

Analyzing patterns from the training examples:

- The multiple ring systems will contribute positively
- The overall polarity will keep it from reaching extremely high values

Based on this analysis and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

3.8

This prediction takes into account both the molecule's complexity and its polar nature, placing it in a moderate-to-high range but not as high as very lipophilic compounds in the training set.

- ClCCCl (1,2-dichloroethane) has a value of 1.464
- Other small halogenated compounds like CCBr (bromoethane) has a value of 1.4012

Dichloromethane (ClCCl) is smaller than 1,2-dichloroethane (ClCCCl) by one carbon, but has a similar number of chlorine atoms. Generally, the property appears to:
- Increase with molecular size
- Increase with lipophilicity
- Be lower for smaller molecules
- Be influenced by halogen content

Given that ClCCl is:
- Smaller than ClCCCl
- Has similar polarity
- Has same number of chlorines but one less carbon
- Would be expected to have slightly lower value than ClCCCl (1.464)

I predict the property value for ClCCl (dichloromethane) to be approximately 1.28

This takes into account that it should be:
- Lower than ClCCCl (1.464) due to smaller size
- Similar range as other small halogenated compounds
- Reflect its polarity and molecular features

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: 2.00904
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and my understanding of molecular structures.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a dimethylphenol (two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a benzene ring).

Looking at similar structures from the training examples:
1. CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (2.82402) - Very similar structure with methyl groups and hydroxyl
2. Oc1cccc(O)c1 (1.0978) - Similar core but with two hydroxyls
3. Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (1.3004) - Similar core but with different substituents

The target molecule has:
- A phenol core (contributing to moderate hydrophobicity)
- Two methyl groups (increasing hydrophobicity)
- One hydroxyl group (providing some hydrophilicity)

Given that:
- It's less hydrophobic than CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (which has an isopropyl group)
- But more hydrophobic than simple phenols
- The position of methyl groups will affect the property

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

2.4

This value takes into account that the molecule should have a property value:
- Lower than 2.82402 (similar but more substituted structure)
- Higher than simple phenols (~1.1)
- Reflecting the contribution of two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 5.967200000000002
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and the target molecule, I notice several patterns that can help predict the property value:

1. The target molecule contains multiple chlorine substituents (4 Cl atoms) and two connected aromatic rings, similar to some training examples.

2. Looking at similar structures:
- Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl has a value of 6.6206
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl has a value of 7.274

3. The target molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than these examples (4 vs 5-6 Cl atoms)
- Similar biphenyl core structure
- Similar substitution pattern

4. Generally, in the training set:
- More chlorines increase the value
- More aromatic rings increase the value
- Biphenyls with halogens tend to have values in the 5-7 range

Based on these observations, I would predict the property value to be approximately 5.8

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than the closest examples (which should lower the value)
- Still maintains the biphenyl core
- Has a similar substitution pattern

The value should be lower than 6.6206 and 7.274 (due to fewer chlorines) but still relatively high due to the biphenyl core and four chlorine substituents.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 1.9725
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (2-methylbut-2-ene) and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the patterns in the given examples, I notice that:
1. Small, simple hydrocarbons tend to have values between 1-3
2. The presence of double bonds slightly reduces the value compared to fully saturated analogs
3. Branching tends to slightly lower the value compared to linear chains of the same carbon count
4. This molecule is a small, branched alkene with 5 carbons total

Comparing to similar molecules in the training set:
- CCCCCCCC (octane) has a value of 3.3668
- CCCCCCCCC=C (dec-1-ene) has a value of 3.923
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (p-cymene) has a value of 3.11842
- Simple molecules with similar size but different functional groups have values around 1.5-2.5

Given the molecule's:
- Small size (5 carbons)
- Presence of a double bond
- Branched structure
- Purely hydrocarbon nature

I predict the property value to be approximately 1.85

This takes into account that it's smaller than most of the training examples, but still hydrophobic enough to have a positive value, while considering the effects of the double bond and branching.

Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1.4215
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (dichloromethane, CH2Cl2) and predict its property value by comparing it with similar molecules in the training set and considering its structural features.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Small halogenated molecules tend to have property values between 2-3
2. The molecule ClCCl is relatively simple and small
3. Similar chlorinated compounds in the training set:
   - ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a value of 3.0682
   - Simpler chlorinated compounds tend to have lower values than complex polychlorinated ones

Given that ClCCl is:
- Smaller than tetrachloroethene (ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl)
- Has fewer chlorine atoms
- Is more similar to simpler molecules in the set
- Has no complex structural features

I would predict a property value of approximately 2.3 for ClCCl.

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is halogenated (which tends to increase the property value) but is also quite small and simple (which tends to decrease it compared to larger halogenated compounds).

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 3.3523999999999994
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms in different positions than the example Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (which has a value of 3.3524).

Key observations:
1. Both molecules are trichlorinated phenols
2. They have similar molecular weight and structure
3. The main difference is in the positioning of the chlorine atoms
4. Both will have similar physicochemical properties due to:
   - Similar hydrophobicity from the three chlorines
   - Similar hydrogen bonding capability from the phenol group
   - Similar electronic effects from the chlorine substituents

Looking at similar structures in the training set and considering the slight differences in chlorine positioning, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

3.3 - 3.4

More specifically, I predict: 3.3612

This prediction is based on:
- The very similar trichlorophenol example (3.3524)
- Other halogenated aromatics in the dataset
- The general trend that multiple halogens increase this property value
- The position effects of the chlorines which might slightly modify the base value

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 1.338599999999999
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters, hydroxy groups)
2. It has a complex polycyclic structure with multiple rings
3. Contains both aromatic and aliphatic regions
4. Has several polar functional groups
5. Looking at similar complex molecules with multiple oxygenated functionalities in the training set, especially those with sugar-like moieties (glycosides), they tend to have lower values
6. The presence of the methylenedioxy group (OCO) and methoxy groups (OC) adds some lipophilicity
7. Comparing to similar complex natural product-like structures in the training set

Based on these observations and patterns from the training data, particularly noting how molecules with multiple oxygen-containing groups and sugar-like portions tend to have lower values, while the presence of aromatic rings and some lipophilic groups increases the value, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

1.8

This prediction takes into account both the polar nature of the molecule (which would decrease the value) and its significant size and aromatic portions (which would increase it), arriving at a moderate value.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.3714999999999997
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, I notice:
1. It contains a heterocyclic ring structure with multiple nitrogen atoms
2. Has a thioether (CSc-) group
3. Contains a carbonyl group
4. Has a tert-butyl substituent (C(C)(C)C)
5. Has a hydrazine-like NH-N group

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a property value of 1.0258 and shares some similar features (nnc ring system, tert-butyl group)
- Other heterocyclic compounds with similar polarity tend to have values between 0.5 and 2.0
- The presence of the thioether group would increase lipophilicity slightly

Taking all these factors into consideration, and noting that the molecule has a balance of polar and non-polar regions, I would predict a property value of approximately 1.15 for this molecule.

Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 1.8633
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my reasoning:

1. The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate (ethyl ester of benzoic acid)

2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- It contains a phenyl ring like many examples
- It has an ester group (C(=O)O) similar to some examples
- Its size and complexity is moderate
- It has both polar (ester) and non-polar (phenyl, ethyl) portions

3. Comparing to relevant examples:
- CCCC(=O)OCC (ethyl butyrate) has value 1.7397
- CC(C)c1ccccc1 (cumene) has value 2.81
- Simple aromatic compounds tend to be in the 1.5-3.0 range
- The presence of the ester group typically reduces the value somewhat compared to pure hydrocarbons

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 to be approximately:

1.92

This value takes into account the molecule's moderate size, the presence of both polar and non-polar groups, and its similarity to other molecules in the training set.

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 3.351700000000002
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this prediction task by looking at the patterns in the given examples and the structural features of the molecules.

The molecule in question (CCCCCCCBr) is a 1-bromoheptane, which is a straight-chain alkyl bromide.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Longer carbon chains tend to have higher values
2. Halogenated compounds (especially Br, Cl) typically show moderate to high values
3. Simple aliphatic structures have values typically between 2-4
4. The presence of a single bromine typically adds around 1-1.5 units compared to the unsubstituted hydrocarbon

Some relevant comparisons from the training set:
- CCCCCCC=C (3.1428) - similar chain length but with double bond
- CCCCCCCO (1.9491) - similar chain length but with OH instead of Br
- Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (3.6023) - has Br but in aromatic system

Given that:
1. The molecule has a 7-carbon chain (contributing to lipophilicity)
2. Contains a bromine (adding to the value)
3. Is purely aliphatic
4. Has similar length to some reference compounds

I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately 3.2

This prediction takes into account the additive nature of the property based on the structural features observed in the training set.
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.3915
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (methanol - CO) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a very small molecule with just 2 atoms (C and O)
2. It contains a hydroxyl group (-OH) similar to other alcohols in the training set
3. Looking at similar small molecules in the training set:
   - CCC (propane) is 1.4163
   - CC#C (propyne) is 0.6395
   - Simple alcohols like CCC(C)CO is 1.0248
   - The presence of oxygen typically reduces the value compared to pure hydrocarbons

4. Considering that:
   - It's smaller than most molecules in the training set
   - Has a polar hydroxyl group
   - Is simpler than ethanol (which would be around 0.8-1.0 based on the patterns)
   - Shows similarity to other small molecules with oxygen

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value for methanol (CO) to be approximately 0.5 ± 0.1.

This prediction takes into account that methanol would have a lower value than ethanol-like molecules due to its smaller size, but higher than very polar molecules with multiple heteroatoms that show negative values in the training set.
