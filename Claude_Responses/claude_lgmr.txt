SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -1.3581273801943898
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (methyl decanoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC:
1. It's a long-chain methyl ester
2. Similar to CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl dodecanoate) in the examples, which has a value of -0.15805406
3. It's slightly shorter (10 carbons vs 12 in the chain)
4. Contains similar functional groups (ester group)
5. Has similar polarity characteristics

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the training set:
- Long chain esters tend to have values close to zero or slightly negative
- The shorter chain length compared to methyl dodecanoate would likely make it slightly less negative
- The presence of the ester group contributes to a moderate negative value

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC to be approximately:

-0.12

This prediction takes into account that it should be slightly less negative than the C12 analog (-0.15805406) due to its shorter chain length, while maintaining similar chemical characteristics.

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.40433668407084516
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCC(C)(C)CO) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with:
- A primary alcohol group (-CH2OH)
- Two methyl branches (geminal dimethyl)
- A propyl chain

Looking at similar structures in the examples:
- CCCC(C)(C)C (branched alkane): 0.10222302
- CCCC(C)(O)CC (branched alcohol): -0.40927309
- CC(C)CC(C)O (branched alcohol): 0.00165589

This molecule shares features with all of these, but is most similar to CCCC(C)(O)CC in terms of:
- Similar carbon chain length
- Presence of geminal substitution
- Presence of an alcohol group

However, our target molecule has the alcohol at a primary position rather than secondary/tertiary, which typically makes it slightly more polar.

Considering these factors and the general trends in the dataset, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The presence of the alcohol group tends to decrease the value compared to pure hydrocarbons
2. The branching partially counteracts this decrease
3. The primary alcohol position likely makes it slightly more polar than CCCC(C)(O)CC

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -5.909556998368863
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule "Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1" (methylnaphthalene), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1. The molecule is a naphthalene derivative with a single methyl substituent
2. It's similar in structure to "Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12" (dimethylnaphthalene, value: -1.64375098) but has one less methyl group
3. It's also similar to "c1ccccc1" (benzene, value: 0.31416228) but is larger and more complex
4. The structure follows similar patterns to other aromatic compounds in the dataset

Looking at the trends in the data:
- Simple aromatics tend to have values between -0.5 and 0.5
- Adding methyl groups to aromatics generally decreases the value
- Naphthalene derivatives show varying values depending on substitution

Based on these patterns and considering the structural similarity to the dimethylnaphthalene example (but with one less methyl group), I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.85

This prediction takes into account that the value should be less negative than the dimethylnaphthalene example (-1.64375098) due to having one less methyl group, but still negative due to the methylated aromatic nature of the compound.

2. The most similar structure in the training set is O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C with value -1.95019216
3. The main difference is that our target molecule has an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) compared to just methyl in the similar example
4. Longer alkyl chains typically increase the value slightly due to increased hydrophobicity

Given these observations, I would predict the property value to be approximately:
-1.85

This is slightly higher (less negative) than the similar structure (-1.95) due to the longer alkyl chain, but still maintains the strong negative character typical of barbituric acid derivatives.

3. The CF3 group is electronically similar to other electron-withdrawing groups
4. Simple aromatic compounds with single substituents tend to have moderate values
5. The molecule in question has a relatively simple structure with one substituent on benzene

Comparing specifically to similar structures in the training set:

2. Other highly oxygenated molecules tend to have negative values
3. Cyclic structures with multiple OH groups generally show negative values
4. The molecule is hydrophilic due to multiple hydroxyl groups

Considering these factors and the structural similarity to the glucose example, but noting that this molecule has one less hydroxyl group and is cyclic, I would predict a value slightly less negative than the glucose example.

My prediction for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O would be approximately: -0.62

This takes into account:
- Similar oxygen content to glucose
- Cyclic nature of the molecule
- Slightly fewer OH groups than glucose
- Overall polarity and hydrogen bonding capability

1. The molecule in question is a tricyclic aromatic system
2. It contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms
3. It's similar in structure to some of the other polycyclic aromatic compounds in the training set
4. It's relatively non-polar

The most similar molecules in the training set are:
- c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 (pentacene derivative) with value 0.73592312
- CCCc1ccccc1 (propylbenzene) with value -1.00039504

True Property: -0.6042712133374376
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and patterns.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethylphenol (specifically, a benzene ring with two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group).

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have moderate negative values
2. Presence of hydroxyl (-OH) groups on aromatic rings tends to push values slightly negative
3. Methyl substituents (-CH3) on aromatic rings tend to contribute to more negative values

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with ester groups (C(=O)OC) tend to have values between -3 and 1
2. Linear aliphatic chains tend to have moderate positive or negative values
3. The length of the carbon chain affects the value
4. This molecule is similar to CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC which has a value of -3.18600449, but is shorter

Given that this molecule is:
- An ester

True Property: -0.6285043486288615
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and structural patterns.

- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 (with an additional OH group) has a value of -1.78089483

The target molecule differs from ethyl benzoate only by having a methyl (CH3-) instead of an ethyl (CH3CH2-) group on the ester. This small difference shouldn't cause a dramatic change in the property value.

Given that:
1. The core structure is very similar to ethyl benzoate
2. The methyl group is slightly smaller than ethyl
3. The overall polarity and electronic effects are very similar

I would predict a value of approximately -1.30 for COC(=O)c1ccccc1.

- The conjugated diene system would affect its properties
- Its size and complexity are relatively simple

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value would be approximately 0.42

-0.35

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of the bromine
- The amide group
- The para-substitution pattern
- The overall molecular size and complexity

True Property: -2.0848534333399713
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is isopropylbenzene (cumene) with an additional methylene group between the isopropyl group and the benzene ring.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with benzene rings generally have negative values
2. Branched alkyl substituents on benzene tend to make the values more negative
3. Similar structures like:

The target molecule has:
- A benzene ring (pushing towards negative)
- A branched alkyl substituent (isopropyl group with CH2 spacer)
- Similar but slightly different from the examples above

Considering these factors and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately:

-1.5

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- More negative than simple alkylbenzenes

True Property: -0.05159531359236796
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde) and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the patterns in the given examples:
1. Simple aromatic systems tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. The presence of oxygen-containing groups (like aldehydes) tends to make the values slightly negative
3. Single-ring aromatic compounds with small substituents generally show moderate values
4. Benzaldehyde has a simple structure with one benzene ring and one aldehyde group

Analyzing similar structures from the examples:
- COc1ccccc1 (anisole) has a value of -0.14617854
- Simple benzene derivatives tend to have values close to zero or slightly negative
- The aldehyde group (C=O) typically contributes to a slightly more negative value than methoxy (OCH3)

Based on these observations and the structural similarities to other molecules in the training set, I predict the property value for benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) to be approximately:

2. It has a cyclic urea structure (diazinone ring)
3. Contains a Schiff base (imine) linkage
4. Has multiple electron-withdrawing groups (nitro, carbonyl)

True Property: -0.5213240612743102
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally very similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training examples, which has a value of -0.92139193. The only difference is that our target molecule has an NH linkage instead of a N=N linkage.

Key observations:
1. Both molecules have two phenyl rings
2. Both have nitrogen atoms connecting the rings
3. The main difference is the saturation of the N-N bond
4. The overall size and general structure is very similar

Given that:
- The saturated N-N bond would slightly decrease the conjugation
- The molecule would have similar physical properties
- The structural similarity is very high
- The change from N=N to N-N typically leads to a small shift in properties

I would predict a value of approximately -0.95 for this molecule.

- A sulfonamide group
- Para substitution pattern

2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a value of -0.59568616
- Other aromatic compounds with polar substituents tend to have values between -2 and 1
- Molecules with sulfur-containing groups aren't well represented in the training set
- The presence of amino groups tends to moderate the values

3. Key considerations:

4. Other small halogenated compounds in the dataset tend to have values around 0.5-0.7
5. The molecule is symmetric and relatively small

Based on these observations, particularly its similarity to ClCCCl (0.58109927) but being slightly smaller, and considering the general trends in the dataset for small halogenated compounds, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.54

This prediction takes into account that:
- It should be close to but slightly lower than ClCCCl
- Small halogenated compounds tend to have positive values in this range
- The symmetry and size of the molecule suggests a moderate positive value

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.6042712133374376
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and molecular structure patterns.

The molecule "Cc1cccc(C)c1O" is a dimethylphenol (specifically, a dimethyl-substituted phenol with two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a benzene ring).

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
1. CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (-3.14139075) - Very similar structure with methyl groups and hydroxyl
2. Oc1cccc(O)c1 (0.1004389) - Similar core structure but with different substitution
3. c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC (-0.83900625) - Contains phenol group but with different substitution

The target molecule is most similar to the first example, though it has a slightly different arrangement of the methyl groups. Given that:
- It has the same number of carbons
- Contains a hydroxyl group in similar position
- Has similar methyl substitutions
- Similar overall molecular weight and structure

I predict the property value would be approximately:

-2.95

This prediction takes into account that the slight structural differences from the closest analog would likely result in a somewhat less extreme value than -3.14, but would still be significantly negative due to the similar substitution pattern and presence of the hydroxyl group.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.39262042693743693
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 4 chlorine atoms. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (5 Cl atoms) has value 0.64577123
2. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl atoms) has value 0.85772694

The target molecule has:
- Biphenyl core structure (like the reference molecules)
- 4 chlorine substituents (fewer than the references)
- Similar substitution pattern but less chlorinated

Given that:
- More chlorine atoms tend to increase the value
- The basic biphenyl structure contributes positively
- The value should be slightly lower than the 5-Cl example due to fewer chlorines
- But higher than non-chlorinated aromatics

I predict the property value would be approximately 0.58

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has structural features between the two reference PCBs but with fewer chlorine atoms, suggesting a value slightly lower than the 5-Cl containing reference compound.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.39102141977369026
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (2-methylbut-2-ene) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Smaller, simpler hydrocarbons tend to have negative values
2. Molecules with double bonds generally have less negative values compared to their saturated counterparts
3. Branched molecules with methyl groups show moderate negative values
4. The presence of C=C in simple molecules tends to make the value less negative compared to single bonds

The target molecule CC=C(C)C is:
- A small hydrocarbon (5 carbons)
- Has one double bond
- Has branching (methyl groups)
- Similar in size/structure to some of the simpler examples

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- CCCCCCCCC=C has -5.26721844 (much larger molecule)
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 has -2.19493433 (aromatic, larger)
- CCCCCCCC has -0.79303999 (saturated, larger)

Given these patterns and the molecule's characteristics, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.85

This takes into account its small size, branching, and the presence of a double bond, placing it in a reasonable range compared to similar structures in the training set.

True Property: -1.5330827899480353
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms in specific positions.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (very similar, just different chlorine positions) has a value of -1.53308279
2. Other halogenated aromatics like Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 has a value of -3.66849922
3. Phenolic compounds like CC(=O)Nc1ccc(O)cc1 has a value of -1.36714172

Given that:
1. The target molecule is most similar to the first reference compound (trichlorophenol)
2. The chlorine positioning is slightly different but maintains similar electronic effects
3. The overall molecular size and polarity are very comparable

I would predict a property value of approximately -1.48 for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl.

This prediction takes into account that:
- The molecule has similar size and halogen count as the closest reference
- The hydroxyl group position relative to the chlorines will have similar electronic effects
- The slight difference in chlorine positions should only cause a minor variation in the property

- Multiple methoxy groups (OC)
- A phenol group (OH)
- A complex ring system
- Multiple ether linkages
- A lactone group (COC=O)
- Multiple stereogenic centers
- A methylenedioxy group (OCO)

2. Looking at the training examples:
- Complex natural product-like structures with multiple rings and oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have values between 0.5 and 1.5

- Molecules with similar complexity and polarity patterns show values in this range

3. Specific structural analogies:
- It shares some similarity with the glycosidic structures in the training set
- The overall complexity is comparable to some of the steroid-like structures which had values around 1.0-1.3

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately:

0.89

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, and its similarity to other complex natural product-like structures in the training set.

2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a value of -0.05505048
- This is particularly relevant as it contains both an nnc pattern and a tert-butyl group
- Other heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen atoms tend to have values around -0.2 to 0.2

3. Considering the structural elements:
- The presence of the thioether typically shifts values slightly negative
- The carbonyl group and amino substituent would contribute to a slightly negative value
- The tert-butyl group would provide some positive contribution

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C to be approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to the training compounds and the combined effects of the various functional groups present in the molecule.

Looking at the patterns in the examples:
1. The molecule contains an ester group (-C(=O)OC-)
2. It has a benzene ring
3. The size and complexity is moderate
4. It's similar in some aspects to other molecules with ester groups in the training set

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -1.3980793073315951
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (1-bromoheptane, CCCCCCCBr) by comparing it with the given examples and looking for patterns in molecular structure and corresponding property values.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Longer alkyl chains tend to have negative values
2. Halogenated compounds (especially brominated) often have negative values
3. The closest structural analogs in the training set are:
   - CCCCCCC=C (-0.78011019) - similar chain length but with double bond
   - CCCCCCCO (-0.41154186) - similar chain length but with OH instead of Br
   - Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (-2.22700695) - contains Br but in aromatic system
   - CI (0.65137868) - simple halogenated compound but much shorter

Given that:
- This is a straight-chain alkyl bromide
- It has a relatively long carbon chain (7 carbons)
- Bromine typically contributes to negative values
- The molecule is similar in size to CCCCCCC=C which has -0.78011019

SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.103138554570512
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

CO (methanol) is one of the simplest organic molecules, containing just a methyl group (-CH3) bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Small, simple molecules tend to have values between -0.5 and 1.0
2. Molecules with hydroxyl groups (-OH) often have slightly negative or small positive values
3. Very short carbon chains with polar groups tend toward moderate values
