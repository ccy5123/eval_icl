SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns that can help predict the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC:

1. This molecule is an ester (contains C(=O)OC group)
2. It has a long alkyl chain (10 carbons) followed by the ester group
3. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
   - CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC has a value of 0.67449076
   - CCOC(=O)CC has a value of 0.67449076
   - Other esters show similar values around 0.67

The target molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is very similar to CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC from the training set, just with a slightly shorter carbon chain. Since both molecules share the same functional group (methyl ester) and similar long alkyl chain structure, and given that other esters in the dataset show consistent values around 0.67449076, I would predict:

Predicted value: 0.67449076

This prediction is based on the observation that the property appears to be more influenced by the functional group (ester in this case) than by the exact length of the alkyl chain, as evidenced by similar values for different chain-length esters in the training set.

The target molecule is a barbiturate derivative with an unsaturated side chain, similar in structure to "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C" from the training examples, which had a value of 0.66312565.

Key observations:
1. The core structure (barbituric acid ring) is identical
2. The main difference is in the substituent: instead of just a methyl (C), we have a longer alkyl chain (C(C)CCC)
3. The CC=C group is present in both molecules
4. The overall size is larger but maintains similar functional groups

Given these similarities and differences, and considering how structural modifications tend to affect this property based on the training set patterns, I would predict a value close to but slightly higher than the reference compound due to the increased alkyl chain length.

My prediction for O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be approximately 0.75

This takes into account:

1. The molecule contains:
- Tertiary amine (CCN)
- Two nitro groups (NO2)
- Trifluoromethyl group (CF3)

- Compounds with tertiary amines
- Highly substituted aromatics

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.45

This prediction takes into account the combined effects of the electron-withdrawing groups (NO2, CF3), the tertiary amine, and the overall molecular complexity, which typically results in moderate positive values in the training set.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict the property value.

CC(C)OC=O is a formate ester (specifically isopropyl formate).

Looking at similar patterns in the training data:
1. CC(C)CCOC=O (isoamyl formate) has a value of 0.67449076
2. CCCCCOC(=O)C (amyl acetate) has a value of 0.67449076
3. Other esters in the dataset tend to have values around 0.6-0.7

The molecule in question is simpler but has the same functional group (formate ester) as some of the training examples. It's shorter in carbon chain length compared to the examples above, but maintains the same core functional group.

Based on these observations and the consistent values seen for similar esters in the training set, I would predict the property value for CC(C)OC=O to be approximately:

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.8393991440337654
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a phenol derivative with:
- A phenol group (OH attached to benzene ring)
- Two methyl groups (C) on the benzene ring
- A relatively simple structure

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
1. Simple phenol (c1ccccc1O) has a value of -0.83939914
2. Molecules with OH groups often have negative or small positive values
3. Additional alkyl substituents (like methyl groups) tend to slightly increase the value compared to unsubstituted analogs
4. The structure is relatively simple compared to more complex molecules in the dataset that have higher values

Based on these observations, I would predict a value around -0.4 to -0.6 for this molecule. The presence of two methyl groups would make it less negative than simple phenol, but the core phenol structure would still maintain a negative value.

My specific prediction is: -0.52

This takes into account that it should be:
- Less negative than simple phenol (-0.83939914)
- Similar to other simple aromatic compounds with OH groups
- Adjusted slightly upward for the two methyl substituents

True Property: 1.2028568322453446
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The target molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has several key features:
1. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S))
2. It has methoxy groups (OC) attached to phosphorus
3. It has an aromatic ring with methylthio (SC) and methyl (C) substituents

Looking at similar structures in the training set:

- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has value 1.20285683

I notice that all molecules with the COP(=S)(OC)O- core structure have exactly the same value of 1.20285683, regardless of the substituents on the aromatic ring. While our target molecule has different substituents (SC and C instead of halogens), the core structure is identical.

Given this strong pattern in the training data, I predict the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 to be:

1.20285683

Based on these observations, particularly the exact structural similarity to other polychlorinated biphenyls in the training set that all have a value of 0.0, I predict that the property value for this molecule would be:

0.0

This prediction is made with high confidence due to the consistent pattern seen with similar PCB structures in the training data.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple alkanes (like CCC) typically have values of 0.0
2. Molecules with N(=O)=O groups often have positive values

4. The complexity and size of the molecule affects the value

For CCCN(=O)=O:
- It's a relatively small molecule
- Contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Has a short alkyl chain
- Similar in size and functionality to some examples

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.42

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's more complex than simple alkanes (which have 0.0)
- Contains a polar functional group
- Is similar in size to other molecules with moderate positive values
- The nitro group typically contributes to positive values in the training set

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples and analyzing the patterns, I notice that:

1. Simple halogenated aromatics (like Clc1ccc(Br)cc1) tend to have values around 0.0
2. Mono-substituted benzenes with halogens often have values in the 0-2 range
3. The combination of F and Br on a benzene ring is similar to other dihalogenated benzenes in the training set

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a benzene ring with fluorine and bromine substituents in a meta relationship. This structure is most similar to molecules like:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (0.0)
- COc1cccc(Cl)c1 (2.10455951)

Given that F is electronically more similar to Cl than to OMe, and considering the presence of Br (which often leads to lower values in the training set), I would predict a value between 0.0 and 1.0.

My prediction for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be approximately 0.0

This prediction is based on the observation that similar dihalogenated benzenes in the training set tend to have values close to 0.0, and the electronic effects of F and Br would likely not dramatically alter this pattern.

True Property: -0.8393991440337654
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples provided.

The target molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 has several notable features:
- It's a bicyclic structure
- Contains an alcohol (OH) group
- Has multiple methyl substituents
- Is a saturated system
- Has some structural similarity to steroids but simpler

Looking at the training examples:

2. Cyclic structures tend to have values between -1 and 2
3. Complex bicyclic structures with OH groups tend to have values around -0.7 to -0.8
4. The molecule shares some structural features with steroid-like molecules in the training set which have values around -0.7 to -0.8

Based on these observations and the structural similarities with other molecules in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.77

This prediction takes into account the presence of the OH group, the bicyclic nature, and the overall structural similarity to other molecules in the training set with similar features.

True Property: 2.1303418630920077
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, I notice:

1. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S)
2. It has a cyclic imide structure
3. It contains aromatic rings
4. It has similar structural elements to some of the training examples, particularly the one with CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O (which has a value of 2.13034186)

The most similar molecule in the training set is CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which differs only by the SC(CCl) group. Since this structural difference is relatively minor and both molecules share the same basic framework (phosphorothioate ester + cyclic imide), I would expect the property value to be similar but slightly lower due to the simpler structure.

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value to be approximately 2.05

This prediction takes into account that:
- The presence of P=S and cyclic imide groups tends to give higher positive values
- The molecule maintains most of the key structural features of the similar training example
- The slightly simpler structure would likely result in a slightly lower value

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The target molecule is a heterocyclic compound containing a pyrazolone ring with phenyl and methyl substituents.

2. Looking at the training examples:
- Molecules with similar heterocyclic structures and aromatic rings tend to have values between 0.5 and 2.0

The molecule CCCCCC(=O)OCC is an ester with:
- A straight chain of 6 carbons on one side
- An ethyl group (CC) on the other side of the ester linkage
- Contains a C(=O)O ester group

Looking at similar patterns in the training data:
1. Simple esters like COC=O have a value around 0.67
2. Longer chain esters like CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC also have a value around 0.67
3. The ester functional group seems to be the main determining factor for this property
4. The length of the carbon chains appears to have minimal impact on the property value

Based on these observations, particularly the consistency of ester compounds having values around 0.67-0.68, I would predict the property value for CCCCCC(=O)OCC to be:

0.67449076

This prediction is based on the apparent consistency of ester compounds in the training set and the structural similarity to other esters that have this same value.

1. This molecule is structurally very similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) from the training set, which has a value of 0.67449076

2. The only difference is that our target molecule has a methyl ester (COC(=O)-) instead of an ethyl ester (CCOC(=O)-)

3. Looking at other ester-containing molecules in the training set, they tend to have values around 0.6 to 0.7 when they're simple aromatic esters

4. The methyl vs ethyl difference typically doesn't cause major changes in this property

Based on these observations, and particularly the strong structural similarity to ethyl benzoate, I would predict that COC(=O)c1ccccc1 would have a property value very close to 0.67449076.

My prediction for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is: 0.67449076

This prediction is based primarily on the near-identical structure to the ethyl benzoate example, with the expectation that the methyl vs ethyl difference would not significantly impact this particular property.

- A phenoxy linkage between two aromatic rings
- Multiple chlorine substituents (3 Cl atoms)
- A hydroxyl group (OH)
- Similar structural elements to some training examples, particularly the chlorinated phenols

Looking at similar structures in the training set:

2. Many simple hydrocarbons in the training set have a value of 0.0, including:
- Linear alkanes (like CCCCCC...)
- Simple branched alkanes (like CC(C)C)

1. O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (dinitrobenzene) has a value of 1.15861217
2. Other aromatic compounds with oxygen-containing substituents show positive values
3. The presence of nitro group (N(=O)=O) tends to give positive values
4. Single-ring aromatic compounds with substituents generally have values between 0 and 2

Considering these patterns and the structural features:
- It has one nitro group (like some positive-valued examples)
- It has a methoxy group (electron-donating)
- It's a mono-substituted benzene derivative
- The substitution pattern is similar to several examples with positive values

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value would be approximately:

1.2

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has similar electronic and structural features to the dinitrobenzene example, but with only one nitro group and an additional methoxy group, which should result in a similar but slightly modified value.

Looking at the training examples, I notice several patterns:
1. Simple hydrocarbons often have a value of 0.0
2. Molecules with hydroxyl groups (-OH) often have values around -0.84
3. More complex structures with nitrogen-containing groups often have higher positive values
4. Halogenated compounds show varying values depending on their structure

For ClCCl specifically:
- It's a very simple molecule
- It's symmetrical
- It contains two chlorine atoms
- It's similar in simplicity to other small halogenated compounds in the dataset
- Looking at similar simple halogenated compounds like "ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl" which has a value of 0.0

Based on these observations, and particularly noting that similar simple halogenated compounds in the training set have values of 0.0, I would predict:

Predicted value for ClCCl = 0.0

This prediction is based on its structural similarity to other simple halogenated compounds in the training set and its relatively simple molecular architecture.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.8393991440337654
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, I notice it's a chlorinated phenol with three chlorine substituents and one hydroxyl group. This structure is very similar to Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl from the training examples, which has a property value of -0.83939914.

Both molecules:
- Have a phenol core structure
- Contain three chlorine substituents
- Have similar electronic and steric properties
- Are likely to have similar physical-chemical properties

Given the nearly identical structure and substitution pattern between these molecules, I would predict the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl to be:

-0.83939914

This prediction is based on the very close structural similarity to the known example, and the fact that the only difference is in the position of one chlorine atom, which is unlikely to significantly affect this particular property given the patterns observed in the training set.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.7590910644722578
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this complex molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my analysis:

1. The molecule contains multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters, hydroxyl groups)
2. It has a complex polycyclic structure with multiple rings
3. Contains methoxy groups (OCH3)
4. Has a methylenedioxy group (OCO bridge)
5. Contains multiple stereocenters
6. Has similarities to some of the larger, complex natural product-like structures in the training set

Looking at the training examples:
- Complex molecules with multiple oxygen-containing groups and ring systems tend to have values between 0.5 and 2.0
- Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups often show positive values
- Natural product-like structures with similar complexity show values around 1.5-2.0

Based on these patterns and the structural features of the given molecule, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.42

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, oxygen content, and similarity to other natural product-like structures in the training set, while considering the general trends observed in the training data.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.10657626216212344
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, I notice:
1. It contains a heterocyclic ring with multiple nitrogen atoms
2. Has a thioether (CSc-) group
3. Contains a carbonyl group (c(=O))
4. Has a tert-butyl substituent (C(C)(C)C)
5. Contains an amino group (-N)

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings containing multiple nitrogens tend to have values around -0.5 to 2.0
- The presence of sulfur-containing groups often contributes to values around 1.5-2.0
- Molecules with tert-butyl groups and heterocycles show values around -0.8 to 1.7
- The combination of carbonyl and amino groups on heterocycles typically results in moderate positive values

Based on these observations and the structural similarities with molecules in the training set, particularly considering compounds like CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C (-0.83215056) and C1SC(=S)NC1(=O) (1.67064852), I would predict the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C to be approximately:

-0.51 

This prediction takes into account the similar structural features and their apparent effects on the property value in the training set.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate, which contains:
- An aromatic ring (benzene)
- An ester group (-C(=O)OC-)
- An ethyl group attached to the ester

Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings generally have positive values
2. Molecules with ester groups (like CCCCCC(=O)OC) have values around 0.67
3. The complexity and size of this molecule is moderate
4. Similar conjugated systems with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups show values between 1.5-2.5

Considering these factors and comparing with the most similar structures in the training set, particularly other aromatic esters and compounds with similar functional groups, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

1.85

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of the aromatic ring
- The ester functionality
- The overall molecular size
- The similarity to other conjugated systems in the training set

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided.

CCCCCCCBr is a straight-chain heptyl bromide (1-bromoheptane).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple halogenated alkanes (like CI) tend to have values close to 0.0
2. Long straight-chain molecules with similar length (like CCCCCCC=C) have values around 0.0
3. The presence of a single halogen atom at the terminal position doesn't seem to dramatically affect the property value in simple molecules
4. Similar molecules with simple functional groups and comparable chain lengths show values between -0.4 and 0.0

Based on these observations, particularly comparing it to similar molecules in the training set like:
- CCCCCCC=C (0.0)
- CI (0.0)
- Simple halogenated compounds (generally close to 0.0)

I would predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately 0.0

This prediction takes into account the molecule's simple structure, the presence of a terminal halogen, and its similarity to other straight-chain molecules in the training set.

SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.8393991440337654
Predicted Property:
Looking at the training examples, I notice several patterns:
1. Simple, small molecules (like CCC, CC#C) often have a value of 0.0
2. Molecules containing alcohol groups (-OH) frequently have values around -0.83939914
3. The molecule in question (CO) is methanol, a very simple alcohol

Given that:
- CO (methanol) is one of the simplest alcohols
- It follows the pattern of other simple alcohols in the training set
- Examples like CCC(C)CO and CC(O)c1ccccc1 both have values of -0.83939914

I predict the property value for CO (methanol) would be -0.83939914

This prediction is based on the consistent pattern seen with other alcohols in the training set, particularly the simpler ones, which consistently show this specific value.
