True Property: 0.484796331322129
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. Long chain aliphatic compounds tend to have positive values
2. Compounds with ester groups (C(=O)OC) typically have values around 0.4-0.5
3. The given molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester with a long alkyl chain

Looking at similar structures in the training set:

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.384253091872139
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (isopropyl nitrite, CC(C)N(=O)=O) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Small, simple molecules tend to have positive values
2. Molecules with nitro/nitrite groups tend to have slightly negative values
3. Molecules with branching and oxygen tend to have moderate values
4. The size and complexity of the molecule affects the value

For CC(C)N(=O)=O:
- It's a relatively small molecule
- Contains a nitrite group (N(=O)=O)
- Has branching (isopropyl group)
- Similar in size/complexity to some other small molecules in the dataset
- Contains oxygen atoms which seem to moderate the values

Comparing to similar molecules in the training set:
- Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO has -0.41753709

1. It's a complex steroid-like structure
2. Contains ketone groups (C=O)
3. Contains a hydroxyl group (OH)
4. Has multiple ring systems
5. Similar structural features to the steroid example in the training set: CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C which has a value of 0.0

The target molecule is very similar to the steroid structure in the training set, with some minor modifications:
- Additional hydroxyl group
- Additional ketone group

Given these observations and the fact that:
1. The most similar molecule in the training set has a value of 0.0
2. The additional polar groups (OH, C=O) might slightly modify the property
3. The overall structure maintains similar complexity and size

I would predict a property value of approximately -0.15 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account the slight increase in polarity from the additional functional groups while maintaining the core structural similarity to the known steroid example.

   - The presence of multiple halogens tends to increase the value slightly
   - Complex aromatic systems with polar substituents generally have negative values

3. The key structural features most similar to the training examples:
   - Multiple halogens on aromatic rings
   - Urea-like functionality
   - Overall polarity and size

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account the negative contribution of the urea linkage, partially offset by the presence of multiple halogens, while considering the overall molecular complexity and polarity.

True Property: 0.08554858052557532
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

True Property: -0.49570417369961994
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The molecule "c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2" is biphenyl - two benzene rings connected directly to each other.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple aromatic structures tend to have values between -0.3 and 0.2
2. More complex fused ring systems tend to be more negative (around -0.8 to -0.9)
3. The molecule in question is simpler than the fused ring systems but more complex than a single benzene ring
4. Similar conjugated aromatic systems in the examples have values around -0.3 to 0.2
5. The molecule lacks any strong electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to other aromatic compounds in the training set, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account that biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic system, more complex than single ring aromatics but simpler than fused ring systems, and lacks any strong electronic effects from substituents.

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 2.513129961462533
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule (CCCCS) and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples:

CCCCS is a relatively simple, linear molecule with:
- 4 carbons in a chain
- A sulfur atom at the end
- No rings, no double bonds, no complex functional groups

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Simple linear/branched alkanes (like CCCCCC(C)C) tend to have values around 1.5
- Small molecules with sulfur (like thiol groups) tend to slightly increase the value
- The molecule is relatively small and simple, similar to some of the alkanes shown

However, this molecule is slightly different from the exact examples given, as it's a thiol.

Based on these observations and the general trends in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately:

1.2 to 1.4

My specific prediction would be: 1.35

This takes into account that:
1. It's similar to simple alkanes (which have values ~1.5)
2. The sulfur group likely reduces the value slightly compared to pure alkanes
3. The size and simplicity of the molecule suggests a moderate positive value

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1.4075708577080217
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with:
- A primary alcohol group (-OH)
- Two methyl branches
- A butyl chain backbone

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCCC(C)(C)C (without OH) has value 1.50328858
- CCCC(C)(O)CC (branched alcohol) has value 1.40757086
- CC(C)CC(C)O (branched alcohol) has value 1.40757086
- CCCCOC (linear alcohol ether) has value 1.40757086

I notice that:
1. Branched alcohols consistently show values around 1.40-1.41
2. The presence of an OH group slightly decreases the value compared to pure hydrocarbons
3. Similar branching patterns maintain similar values

Based on these patterns, and particularly the very close structural similarity to CCCC(C)(O)CC, I predict the property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO to be:

1.40757086

This prediction is based on the consistent pattern seen for branched alcohols in the training set, and the nearly identical structural features to several reference compounds.

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.3292466726293432
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule "Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1" (methylnaphthalene), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1. This molecule is structurally very similar to several examples in the training set, particularly:
- "Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12" (dimethylnaphthalene, -0.32924667)
- "Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1" (methylanthracene, -0.62617817)

2. The target molecule is simpler than both these reference molecules:
- It has only one methyl group (unlike the dimethylnaphthalene)
- It has a simpler ring system than the methylanthracene

3. Looking at other aromatic systems in the dataset:
- Simple benzene "c1ccccc1" has a value of 0.15405144
- Adding substituents to aromatic systems generally decreases the value in this property

4. The target molecule is essentially naphthalene with a single methyl group, which should place its value between simple aromatics and the more complex substituted naphthalenes.

Based on these considerations, I would predict a value of approximately -0.32 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that the property value should be:
- Lower than simple benzene derivatives
- Higher than methylanthracene
- Similar to but slightly higher than dimethylnaphthalene (since it has one fewer methyl group)

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: -0.5445053723860819
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The target molecule is a barbiturate derivative with an unsaturated side chain. Looking at the training examples, I notice:

1. Similar cyclic structures with multiple C=O and N-H groups tend to have negative values
2. The most similar molecule in the training set is O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C with a value of -0.54450537
3. The target molecule differs by having an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) compared to the similar example which just has a methyl group

Key considerations:
- The core structure is nearly identical to the reference barbiturate
- The longer alkyl chain will make it slightly more lipophilic
- The presence of the double bond (CC=C) is maintained
- The overall polarity pattern from the cyclic core remains similar

Given these factors, I would predict a value slightly less negative than the reference compound, but still negative due to the polar core structure.

My prediction: -0.51000000

This takes into account that the longer alkyl chain would slightly reduce the negative value compared to the reference molecule (-0.54450537) but maintains the overall negative character due to the polar functional groups in the core structure.

- Similar in size to some of the mono and di-halogenated benzenes in the examples

4) Based on these observations and the trends in the example set, I would predict a value around:

1.85

This prediction takes into account that:
- It should be higher than unsubstituted benzene
- Lower than the iodo-chloro benzene example
- The CF3 group would contribute to a relatively high positive value
- The molecule's size and substitution pattern suggests a value in this range

True Property: 0.9792682599759074
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The target molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a cyclic sugar (monosaccharide) structure with multiple hydroxyl groups. Looking at similar structures in the training examples:

1. OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO (linear sugar with multiple OH groups) has a value of 0.97926826
2. Most highly oxygenated, polar molecules in the examples tend to have values between 0 and 1
3. The cyclic nature and multiple hydroxyl groups make it similar to the linear sugar example, but slightly more constrained

Given these observations and patterns:
- The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups tends to give values in the positive range
- Cyclic structures with oxygen tend to moderate the values somewhat
- The similarity to the linear sugar example is strong

I would predict a property value of approximately 0.92 for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O.

This prediction takes into account that it should be slightly lower than the linear sugar example due to its cyclic nature, but still maintain a similar positive value due to the similar hydroxyl group pattern.

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Small molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups (alcohols, esters) tend to have values around 0.5 to 1.5
2. The presence of C=O groups tends to lower the value somewhat compared to alcohols
3. Similar sized molecules with ester groups (like CCOC=C) have values around 0.6

2. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values closer to 0
3. The target molecule (fluorene) is a tricyclic aromatic compound with two benzene rings fused to a five-membered ring

Key observations about fluorene:
- It's more compact than anthracene
- Has similar structural features to other fused aromatic systems in the training set
- Is less planar than purely fused benzene ring systems
- Has moderate aromaticity

Based on these considerations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict the property value for fluorene to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account that it should:
- Be less negative than anthracene (-0.80860866)
- Be more negative than simple benzene derivatives
- Reflect its intermediate complexity between simple aromatics and larger fused systems

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -0.5988253755202549
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, I notice:
1. It contains a sulfonamide group -S(=O)(=O)-
2. Has multiple amino groups (-NH2)
3. Contains a para-substituted benzene ring
4. Has polar functional groups
5. Is relatively small and contains multiple hydrogen bond donors/acceptors

Analyzing the training set patterns:
- Molecules with polar groups and aromatic rings tend to have negative values
- Molecules with multiple hydrogen bonding capabilities generally show negative values
- Sulfonamide-containing compounds in the training set tend to have values around -0.2 to -0.6
- Para-substituted benzenes with polar groups typically show negative values

Based on these observations and the structural similarities with other molecules in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.48

This prediction takes into account the molecule's polarity, size, and functional group composition while comparing it to similar structures in the training set.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.8818666498830983
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and molecular patterns.

Looking at the test molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, I notice:

1. It contains nitro groups (N(=O)=O)
2. Has a trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)
3. Contains an alkene group (C=C)
4. Has a tertiary amine structure
5. Contains an aromatic ring with multiple substituents

Looking at patterns from the training examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative values (e.g., Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O at -0.5069072)
- Complex substituted aromatics generally show negative values
- Multiple electron-withdrawing groups tend to push the value more negative
- The presence of fluorine and nitrogen substituents typically contributes to more negative values

Based on these observations and the structural complexity of the molecule, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.65 to -0.70

My specific prediction would be: -0.67845231

This takes into account the combined effects of the electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and trifluoromethyl), the aromatic system, and the tertiary amine structure, while considering the overall molecular complexity.

Iteration: 26
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.484796331322129
Predicted Property:
Looking at the training examples and analyzing the molecule CC(C)OC=O (isopropyl formate), I can make several observations:

1. This molecule contains an ester group (OC=O)
2. It's a relatively small, simple molecule
3. It's similar in structure to other esters and formates in the training set
4. Looking at similar compounds in the training set:
   - CC(C)CCOC=O (property value: 0.48479633)
   - CC(=O)N (property value: 0.48479633)
   - CCCCCOC(=O)C (property value: 0.48479633)

I notice that several compounds with similar functional groups (especially esters) have a property value very close to 0.48479633. Given the structural similarity and the consistent pattern in the training data, I would predict that CC(C)OC=O would have a property value of:

0.48479633

This prediction is based on the observation that compounds with similar ester functionalities and comparable molecular size tend to have this specific value in the training set.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.06008285149656904
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethyl phenol (two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a benzene ring).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple phenols (c1ccccc1O) have a value around -0.06
2. Methylated aromatics (like CCc1ccccc1C) have values around 0.15
3. The presence of hydroxyl groups (-OH) tends to decrease the value
4. Multiple substituents on benzene rings tend to have additive effects

Given that this molecule has:
- A phenol base structure (similar to c1ccccc1O, -0.06)
- Two methyl groups (which typically increase the value slightly)
- One hydroxyl group (which decreases the value)

Considering these factors and the overall structural similarity to the training examples, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.04

This prediction takes into account that the hydroxyl group's negative contribution is partially offset by the two methyl groups, resulting in a value slightly higher than simple phenol but still negative.

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 1.3610403293342181
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has several key features:
1. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)) similar to several high-value examples
2. It has methoxy groups (OC) attached to the phosphorus
3. It has an aromatic ring with methyl and methylthio substituents
4. The overall structure is similar to other phosphorothioate pesticide-like compounds in the training set

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a value of 2.90523321
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has a value of 3.68536671
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has a value of 4.94800786

The target molecule has a similar backbone but with less electronegative substituents (SC and C instead of Cl, Br, or I). This would likely result in a lower value than these reference compounds.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value would be approximately:

2.4 ± 0.3

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a relatively high value due to the phosphorothioate group, but lower than the chlorinated/brominated/iodinated analogs in the training set.
==================================================
Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 1.2484575919628509
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has several key characteristics:
1. It contains multiple chlorine atoms (5 Cl atoms)
2. It has a biphenyl-like structure (two benzene rings connected)
3. The chlorines are distributed across both rings

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl, biphenyl) has value 1.98130926
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (7 Cl, biphenyl) has value 2.94292335

The target molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than both reference molecules
- Similar biphenyl core structure
- Different chlorine distribution pattern

Based on these observations and the apparent trend that:
- More chlorines generally increase the value
- Biphenyl structures with chlorines typically have values in the 1.5-3.0 range
- 5 Cl atoms would place it between simpler chlorinated compounds and the reference molecules

I predict the property value would be approximately 1.85

This takes into account that it should be:
- Lower than the 6-Cl biphenyl (1.98)
- Significantly higher than mono- or di-chlorinated benzenes
- Reflect the impact of the 5 chlorines and biphenyl structure
==================================================
Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.384253091872139
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O, propyl nitrite) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. Contains a short carbon chain (propyl)
3. Has oxygen-containing functional group
4. Similar in size to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- Simple alkanes (CCC) have values around 1.50
- Molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative values
- Oxygen-containing molecules with short chains tend to have values between 0 and 1
- The presence of N=O groups typically reduces the value compared to pure hydrocarbons

Based on these patterns and considering the molecular structure, I would predict a value of approximately 0.45 for CCCN(=O)=O.

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The base propyl chain would contribute positively
2. The nitro group would reduce the value somewhat
3. The molecule's size and complexity is relatively simple
4. It's more polar than pure hydrocarbons but less than highly oxygenated compounds

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.7409440640273717
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobromobenzene, where fluorine and bromine are substituted on a benzene ring in different positions.

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of 1.47902185 (similar dihalogenated benzene)
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 and similar halogenated aromatics tend to have values around 0.2-1.5
- Bromine substitutions generally contribute to higher values
- Fluorine substitutions typically have lower contributions compared to chlorine or bromine

Considering these patterns:
1. The base structure is similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (1.47902185)
2. Fluorine typically has a smaller effect than chlorine
3. The meta substitution pattern might slightly affect the value

Based on these considerations, I would predict a value of approximately 1.25 for Fc1cccc(Br)c1.

This prediction takes into account that the value should be:
- Lower than Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (1.47902185) due to F instead of Cl
- Higher than simple monohalogenated benzenes
- In line with other dihalogenated aromatic compounds in the dataset

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 1.4075708577080217
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule and the given examples, I'll make a prediction based on several observations:

1) The target molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic structure with:
- A hydroxyl group (-OH)
- Multiple methyl substituents
- A relatively compact, bridged ring system

2) Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with hydroxyl groups and similar carbon frameworks tend to have values around 0.3 to 1.4
- Bicyclic structures generally show values in the moderate range
- The presence of -OH groups tends to reduce the value compared to purely hydrocarbon structures

3) The molecule shares some structural similarities with steroids in the training set, but is simpler

4) The molecule is relatively non-polar despite the hydroxyl group due to its compact structure

Based on these considerations and comparing with the most similar structures in the training examples, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.34

This prediction takes into account that the molecule's complexity and polarity appears to place it in a similar range as some of the moderately complex structures with hydroxyl groups in the training set.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.14410619459541996
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value by comparing it to the training examples and considering structural similarities and patterns.

The target molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has several key features:
1. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S)
2. Has a cyclic imide structure
3. Contains aromatic ring
4. Has ester-like linkages
5. Overall structure is similar to CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O from the training set (0.64036336)

Looking at the most similar structure in the training set, the main difference is the replacement of -SC(CCl)- with a direct bond to N. This should make the molecule slightly less lipophilic than the training example.

Considering these factors and the similar structures in the training set, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.45

This prediction is based on:
- The similarity to the training compound (0.64036336)
- The removal of the lipophilic -SC(CCl)- group
- The presence of similar functional groups
- The overall molecular architecture

True Property: -0.6034916031337647
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The target molecule is a heterocyclic compound containing a pyrazolone ring with phenyl and methyl substituents.

2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- It has some similarity to molecules containing fused ring systems with nitrogen
- It contains a carbonyl group like several examples
- It has aromatic rings like many negative-valued examples
- It's relatively compact compared to many examples
- It has N-phenyl substitution similar to some examples

3. Analyzing patterns in the training data:
- Complex heterocyclic structures tend to have negative values
- N-containing aromatics generally show negative values
- Molecules with similar size and complexity tend to be in the -0.5 to -0.9 range

4. The molecule's key features (N-phenyl pyrazolone) suggest it would behave similarly to other heterocyclic aromatic compounds in the training set.

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.73

This prediction takes into account the molecule's structural similarity to other heterocyclic compounds in the training set and its relative complexity.

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.484796331322129
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule (CCCCCC(=O)OCC) and predict its property based on the patterns I observe in the training examples:

1. This is an ester molecule with a medium-length carbon chain
2. Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Simple esters like COC=O have value around 0.48
- Longer chain esters like CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC also have value around 0.48
- The molecule contains no aromatic rings or complex functional groups
- It's relatively non-polar with a moderate carbon chain length
- The ester group typically contributes to a slightly positive value

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, particularly looking at similar ester compounds and molecules with comparable chain lengths, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.48

This prediction is based on:
1. The consistent values seen for ester compounds in the training set
2. The molecule's relatively simple structure
3. The presence of a medium-length carbon chain
4. The absence of any unusual structural features that might significantly alter the property

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.33642650190913415
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples and analyzing the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1. This molecule is structurally very similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) which has a value of -0.3364265
2. The only difference is that our target molecule has a methyl ester (COC(=O)-) instead of an ethyl ester (CCOC(=O)-)
3. Generally, methyl esters have very similar properties to their ethyl counterparts, with slightly higher polarity
4. Looking at other aromatic esters in the training set:
   - CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 has a value of -0.46676087 (but includes a hydroxyl group)
   - CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 has a value of -0.3364265 (direct analog)

Based on these observations, I would predict the property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 to be approximately -0.35

The reasoning is that it should be very close to the ethyl benzoate value (-0.3364265), possibly slightly more negative due to the shorter alkyl chain, but the difference should be minimal.

Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.4997054635791074
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. Simple, small hydrocarbons tend to have positive values
2. Molecules with conjugated double bonds tend to have slightly lower values than their saturated counterparts
3. The target molecule C=CCC=C is a simple hydrocarbon with two double bonds
4. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
   - CC/C=C/C has a value of 0.94068764
   - Simple hydrocarbons like C1CCCC1 has 1.50328858
   - C=Cc1ccccc1 has -0.11688175 (but this one has an aromatic ring)

The target molecule C=CCC=C is most similar to CC/C=C/C, but has an additional double bond which would likely decrease the value slightly due to increased conjugation potential.

Based on these observations, I would predict a value of approximately 0.85 for C=CCC=C.

This prediction takes into account that it's a simple hydrocarbon (pushing the value positive) but has two double bonds (bringing the value down somewhat compared to fully saturated analogs).
==================================================
Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 8.929683163824118
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (tribromomethane/bromoform - CBr3H) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Halogenated compounds (especially polyhalogenated) tend to have higher values
2. Small molecules with multiple halogens show values around 2-3
3. Similar structures like FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br has a value of 3.2985052

Key observations about CBr3H:
- It's a small molecule
- Contains three bromine atoms
- Similar to chloroform but with bromine instead of chlorine
- Bromine atoms typically contribute more to this property than chlorine atoms
- The molecule is relatively symmetric

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, particularly comparing it to similar halogenated structures, I would predict a value of approximately:

3.15

This prediction takes into account that bromine typically has a stronger effect than chlorine, but the molecule is smaller than some of the other polyhalogenated compounds in the training set.

- Ethoxy groups (OCC)

2. Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
- Molecules with P=S tend to have values around 1.2-1.3 (like the example with COP(=S))
- Chlorinated compounds generally increase the value
- The presence of a complex ring system with C=O groups tends to decrease the value
- The presence of heteroatoms (N, O, S) generally decreases the value compared to pure hydrocarbons

3. Most similar compounds from the examples:
- COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 (1.27055426)
- Other complex molecules with multiple heteroatoms and aromatic rings tend to have values between -0.5 and -1.0

Based on these considerations and the structural similarities, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.98 ± 0.2

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has similar features to the phosphorothioate example but with some structural differences that would likely slightly lower the value.

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains several key structural features:
- A urea linkage (N-C(=O)-N)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring
- A heterocyclic ring system with N-N and O
- A tert-butyl group
- N,N-dimethyl substitution

2. Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Molecules with urea-like structures tend to have negative values
- Chlorinated aromatics generally contribute to slightly negative values
- N,N-dimethyl groups (as seen in CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C) contribute slightly positive values
- Complex heterocycles tend to push towards negative values
- The overall size and complexity is similar to several molecules in the training set with negative values

3. Considering the most similar molecules from the training set:
- Complex heterocyclic structures with multiple N atoms typically show values around -0.4 to -0.7
- Molecules with similar complexity and mixed functionality tend to be in the negative range

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately:

-0.52

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, the presence of multiple polar groups, and its similarity to other structures in the training set.

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: -0.16183537900079706
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has:
- A phenoxy linkage between two aromatic rings
- Multiple chlorine substituents (3 Cl)
- A hydroxyl group (OH)
- Similar structural elements to some training examples, particularly chlorinated aromatic compounds

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl has a value of 0.68994708
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a value of 1.98130926
- Other chlorinated aromatics tend to have values between -0.3 and 0.7

The target molecule is larger than Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl but smaller than Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl. It has a similar number of electron-withdrawing groups but is connected by an ether linkage which would affect its properties.

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I predict the property value would be approximately:

0.42

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a value:
- Higher than simple chlorinated benzenes
- Lower than highly chlorinated phenols
- Moderated by the phenoxy linkage

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.9406876400070361
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice this is a molecular property prediction task. The query molecule CC/C=C\C is a cis-2-pentene, which is very similar to CC/C=C/C (trans-2-pentene) from the training examples, which had a value of 0.94068764.

The only difference between these molecules is the stereochemistry of the double bond (cis vs trans). Generally, cis and trans isomers have similar but slightly different properties, with cis isomers typically having slightly different values due to their more compact spatial arrangement.

Given that the trans isomer has a value of 0.94068764, and considering the general trend that cis isomers often have slightly different properties, I would predict the property value for CC/C=C\C to be approximately:

0.92

This prediction takes into account:
1. The very close structural similarity to the trans isomer
2. The general principle that cis/trans isomers have similar but not identical properties
3. The small modification in molecular geometry due to the cis configuration

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 1.4075708577080217
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CCCOCC is a simple aliphatic ether with:
- A linear chain structure
- An oxygen atom connecting two alkyl groups
- No cyclic structures, aromatics, or other functional groups
- Similar in complexity to simple alcohols and alkanes in the training set

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- Simple alkanes like C (methane) have values around 1.50
- Simple alcohols like CC(C)O have values around 1.40
- Molecules with oxygen tend to have slightly lower values than pure hydrocarbons
- The length of the carbon chain seems to have a moderate effect

Based on these patterns, I would predict that CCCOCC would have a property value of approximately:

1.2

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's a relatively simple molecule like the alkanes
2. The presence of oxygen typically reduces the value somewhat
3. The molecule is larger than methane but smaller than many of the complex structures
4. It lacks any of the features (halogens, aromatics) that tend to give extreme values

1. The molecule contains:
- Two phenyl rings
- A urea-like structure (N-C(=O)-N)
- N-methylation
- A tertiary carbon with two methyl groups

2. Looking at similar structures from the examples:
- Molecules with two phenyl rings tend to have negative values
- N-containing heterocycles and urea-like structures generally push towards negative values
- The presence of N-methylation and bulky groups tends to make the value less negative

3. Most similar examples from the training set:
- CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23 (0.21415309)
- Molecules with two phenyl rings like C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (-0.49570417)
- Other N-containing aromatic compounds with similar complexity tend to be in the -0.4 to -0.8 range

Based on these considerations and the structural patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account the structural similarities with other molecules in the training set and the general trends observed for molecules containing similar functional groups and structural features.

Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is an N-acetyl brominated aniline derivative. Looking at the patterns in the training data:

1. Molecules with bromine substituents on benzene rings typically have values around:
- Fc1cccc(Br)c1: 0.74094406
- Oc1ccc(Br)cc1: 0.52994602

2. Molecules with amide groups (-NH(C=O)-) tend to have slightly negative values.

3. Para-substituted benzenes with electron-withdrawing groups show values in the negative range.

4. The structure is most similar to some of the aromatic compounds with polar substituents in the training set.

Considering these factors:
- The bromine would push the value up (positive direction)
- The amide group would pull the value down (negative direction)
- The para-substitution pattern suggests moderate values

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.25

This takes into account both the electron-withdrawing nature of the acetamido group and the electron-donating nature of the bromine, while considering the overall molecular structure and similarity to other compounds in the training set.

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.15405143729074275
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:
1. Molecules with simple aromatic rings tend to have values between -0.3 and 0.2
2. The presence of branched alkyl chains attached to aromatic rings typically results in values around 0.1 to 0.2
3. Similar structures like CCc1ccc(C)cc1 has a value of 0.15405144

The target molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is an aromatic ring (benzene) with a branched alkyl chain (isobutyl group) attached. It's structurally similar to other alkylbenzenes in the training set.

Based on these observations and particularly its similarity to other alkylated aromatic compounds in the dataset, I predict the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 to be approximately:

0.15405144

This prediction is based on the very similar value seen for related structures, particularly other alkyl-substituted benzenes in the training set.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.17923548440253834
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simpler aromatic structures tend to have values between -0.5 and 0.5
2. The presence of oxygen-containing groups (especially C=O) tends to decrease the value
3. Single-ring aromatic compounds with small substituents typically have moderate values
4. Benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) has a simple structure with one benzene ring and one aldehyde group

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- COc1ccccc1 (anisole) has -0.06008285
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (salicylamide) has -0.46676087
- Simple benzene derivatives tend to have values closer to 0

Given that benzaldehyde has a structure intermediate between these examples, and considering the electron-withdrawing effect of the aldehyde group, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account that the aldehyde group would have a moderate electron-withdrawing effect, but not as strong as multiple substituents or more complex functional groups seen in the training set.

2. It has a nitro group (-NO2)
3. Contains a cyclic urea/hydantoin-like structure
4. Has a hydrazone linkage
5. Contains multiple polar groups (C=O, N-N, NO2)

- Presence of NO2 groups often leads to more negative values (see example with nitro groups)
- Molecules with multiple polar groups and H-bond acceptors tend to have values in the negative range
- Similar sized molecules with comparable complexity show values between -0.3 and -0.9

Based on these patterns and considering the structural features, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

1. Molecules with similar structural features tend to have similar property values
2. The closest matching structure in the training set is "N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2" with a value of -0.68432795
3. The query molecule "N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2" is very similar, with the only difference being a single vs double bond between the nitrogen atoms

Given these observations:

1. Both molecules have two phenyl rings connected by nitrogen atoms
2. The query molecule has a single N-N bond instead of a double bond
3. Single bonds generally contribute to slightly less negative values compared to double bonds in similar structures
4. The overall structural similarity suggests the property value should be very close to -0.68432795, but slightly less negative

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 to be approximately:

- Other cyclic structures containing C=O and N typically have negative values
- The presence of the cyclopentane ring might make it slightly less negative

Based on these observations and the structural similarities, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The molecule has similar polarity to other cyclic imides
2. It's more compact than some of the larger negative-valued molecules
3. The cyclopentane ring adds some lipophilicity
4. The overall structure suggests moderate water solubility

The target molecule is most similar to "Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl" (value 1.24845759) but is slightly simpler.

Considering these factors, I predict the property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be approximately 1.15

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of three chlorines (increasing the value)
- The biphenyl core structure
- The similarity to other chlorinated aromatics in the training set
- The general trend that highly chlorinated aromatics have positive values in the 1.0-1.3 range
==================================================

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: -0.7284472911837231
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and the target molecule, I notice this is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) structure similar to some of the examples. Specifically, it appears to be pyrene.

The target molecule is a pure PAH without substituents, and its size/complexity is intermediate between these examples. Based on these structural similarities and trends, I would predict a value around:

-0.75

This prediction takes into account that:
1. Pure PAHs tend to have negative values in this property scale
2. The value seems to become more negative with increasing PAH size
3. The target molecule's complexity is similar to the reference PAHs

- Molecules with similar size and complexity generally have values between -0.5 and -1.0

Considering these factors and comparing with the most similar structures in the training set, particularly those with multiple hydroxyl groups and fused ring systems, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.82

This prediction takes into account the molecule's similarity to other complex oxygenated aromatic compounds in the training set, while considering the generally negative influence of multiple hydroxyl groups on this property.

1. The target molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphate group P(=O)
- An acetamido group (NC(C)=O)
- Methoxy (COP) and methylthio (SC) substituents

2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules containing phosphate groups like CCN(CC)C(=O)C(=CCOP(=O)(OC)OC)Cl have values around 0.7
- Molecules with amide groups (-NC(=O)-) generally show negative or small positive values
- Smaller molecules with sulfur tend to have slightly positive values

3. The molecule's size and complexity is moderate, suggesting it shouldn't have extreme values like those seen for highly chlorinated compounds (which show very high values >8)

4. The combination of polar groups (P=O, NC(=O)) would likely reduce the property value compared to purely hydrocarbon structures

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC to be approximately:

0.45

This prediction takes into account the moderating effect of the polar groups while acknowledging the contribution of the phosphorus and sulfur atoms.

1. It's a small molecule
2. Contains a double bond
3. Has two chlorine atoms
4. Has trans geometry (indicated by \/)

Looking at patterns in the training examples:
- Small, halogenated molecules tend to have higher positive values
- Molecules with chlorine atoms often have positive values
- Simple structures with few carbons generally have higher values
- Unsaturated compounds (with double bonds) tend to have slightly lower values than their saturated counterparts

Comparing with similar structures in the training set:
- CCBr has 2.98096824
- CCCCBr has 2.98096824
- Simple halogenated compounds show high positive values

However, this molecule is smaller than those examples and has a double bond, which would likely reduce the value somewhat compared to fully saturated halogenated compounds.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for Cl\C=C/Cl to be approximately:

2.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's small size, presence of two chlorine atoms, and the unsaturation, placing it in a range between the highly positive values of simple halogenated compounds but lower than the brominated examples due to the double bond and chlorine vs. bromine difference.

Given that CCCCCO is:
- A primary alcohol (which typically has lower values than tertiary alcohols)
- Has a straight chain (less bulky than branched structures)
- Is smaller than the cyclic alcohol example
- But has the stabilizing OH group

I would predict a value of approximately 1.15 for CCCCCO.

This prediction takes into account that it should be:

- The oxygen in the heterocycle would contribute to slightly more negative values

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account the molecule's mixed polar/non-polar nature, the presence of the amide group, and the overall structural similarity to other molecules in the training set with negative values.

Considering these factors:
1. The base structure is similar to ethane (which would have a value less than pentane)
2. The chlorine substitution will increase the value somewhat
3. The molecule's small size will keep the value moderate

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for ClCC to be approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account that it should be:

- The presence of aromatic rings tends to lower the value somewhat
- Molecules with CCl3 groups often have higher values
- Nitrogen-containing aromatics tend to have slightly lower values than their carbon-only counterparts

Considering these factors:
- The CCl3 group will contribute significantly to a higher value
- The pyridine ring will moderate this somewhat

Based on similar structures and these patterns, I would predict a value of approximately:

2.85 ± 0.5

This prediction takes into account that it should be higher than most aromatic compounds but lower than fully chlorinated aliphatic compounds in the training set.

True Property: 0.484796331322129
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. The property appears to be related to molecular polarity and lipophilicity
2. Similar structural patterns tend to have similar values
3. Molecules with esters (CCCCOC=O is a formate ester) tend to have values around 0.4-0.8

Looking at the most relevant examples from the training set:
- CCCC(=O)OCC (ethyl butyrate) = 0.48479633
- CCCCCC=O (hexanal) = 0.81120822
- Simple esters and short-chain compounds tend to have values in this range

The target molecule CCCCOC=O (butyl formate) is:

2. It's a small halogenated hydrocarbon like some other examples
3. It has two chlorine atoms like some other chlorinated compounds in the dataset
4. It's smaller than ClCCCl but has the same number of chlorines

Considering these factors:
- The presence of chlorines tends to increase the value
- Shorter carbon chains generally have slightly higher values in halogenated compounds
- The symmetrical nature of the molecule is similar to other high-value compounds

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value for ClCCl to be approximately:

3.45

This prediction takes into account that it's slightly smaller than ClCCCl (3.38167798) but maintains the same number of chlorines, which should result in a slightly higher value due to the more concentrated electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorines on a shorter carbon chain.

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.06008285149656904
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

The molecule "Cc1cccc(C)c1O" is a dimethylphenol (two methyl groups on a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group).

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (-0.06008285) - Very similar structure with methyl groups and hydroxyl
2. Oc1cccc(O)c1 (-0.23763153) - Similar core structure but with two hydroxyls
3. Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (-0.5069072) - Similar core but with nitro group instead of methyl

The target molecule is most similar to the first example, CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, which has a value of -0.06008285. The main difference is just in the position of the methyl groups.

Given that:
- It has the same number of carbons
- Contains one hydroxyl group like the closest match
- Has similar substitution pattern
- Similar overall molecular weight and structure

I would predict a value very close to -0.06008285, specifically:

-0.06 ± 0.02

Therefore, my predicted value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is -0.06

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.6899470822311845
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the target molecule, I notice several patterns:

1. The molecule contains multiple chlorine substituents (4 Cl atoms)
2. It has a biphenyl-like structure (two benzene rings connected)
3. The chlorine substitution pattern is similar to some of the examples with high values

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl has a value of 1.98130926
- Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl has a value of 1.24845759

The target molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than the first reference (4 vs 6)
- Similar biphenyl core structure
- More symmetric distribution of chlorines

Based on these observations and the general trend that:
- Chlorinated aromatics tend to have positive values
- More chlorines generally increase the value
- The value should be between the two reference molecules

I predict the property value would be approximately 1.45

This takes into account that it should be:
- Lower than 1.98 (fewer chlorines)
- Higher than 1.24 (better chlorine distribution)
- In line with other chlorinated aromatic compounds in the dataset

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.9406876400070361
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is 2-methylbut-2-ene, a small hydrocarbon with:
- A double bond
- 5 carbons total
- Branched structure
- Two methyl groups on one side of the double bond
- One methyl group on the other side

Looking at patterns in the training data:
1. Small hydrocarbons tend to have positive values
2. Molecules with double bonds but without functional groups tend to have values between 0.1 and 1.0
3. Similar sized alkenes in the training set like CCCCC(CC)C=O have values around 0.8
4. The presence of branching slightly reduces the value compared to linear chains

Based on these observations and the molecule's structural features, I predict the property value would be approximately:

0.65

This prediction takes into account that it's a small hydrocarbon (pushing the value positive), has a double bond (moderating the value), and has branching (slightly reducing it from what a linear pentene would be).

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 3.381677975584457
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Highly chlorinated molecules tend to have higher positive values
2. Simple, small chlorinated molecules show moderate positive values
3. The number and arrangement of chlorine atoms significantly impacts the value
4. Molecules with similar structural features tend to have similar values

ClCCl is a simple molecule with:
- Two chlorine atoms
- One carbon atom
- Simple symmetrical structure
- No other functional groups

Comparing to similar molecules in the training set:
- CCl4 (tetrachloromethane) has a value around 4.95
- More complex polychlorinated compounds have higher values
- Simple halogenated compounds tend to have moderate positive values

Based on these observations and the molecule's characteristics, I predict the property value for ClCCl (dichloromethane) to be approximately:

2.8

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Lower than CCl4 (which has more chlorine atoms)
- Higher than simple non-halogenated compounds
- Positive due to the presence of chlorine atoms
- Moderate in value due to its simple structure

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 1.2484575919628509
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms at positions 2,4,6 and a hydroxyl group.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (2,4,6-trichlorophenol) has a value of 1.24845759
2. Other halogenated compounds like ClCC (2.31568671) and CC(Cl)CCl (3.38167798) show that chlorine atoms generally increase the property value
3. Aromatic compounds with multiple halogens like Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 have higher values (3.73039943)

The target molecule is exactly the same as the first reference compound (Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl) - it's just written in a slightly different way but represents the same 2,4,6-trichlorophenol structure.

Therefore, I predict the property value would be:

1.24845759

This prediction is made with high confidence since we have the exact same molecule in our training set, just with a different SMILES notation.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -0.9842920941048315
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule appears to be a complex natural product-like structure with:
- Multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters)
- A methylenedioxy group (OCO)
- Multiple aromatic rings
- Several stereocenters
- Hydroxyl groups
- A lactone moiety

2. Looking at the training examples:
- Complex molecules with multiple oxygen atoms and rings tend to have negative values
- Natural product-like structures with similar complexity (like steroids) have values around -0.1 to -0.9
- The presence of aromatic rings with oxygen substituents generally contributes to negative values
- Molecules with similar structural features (multiple oxygens, fused rings) typically show values in the -0.7 to -0.9 range

3. This molecule shares characteristics with several of the more complex examples in the training set, particularly those with:
- Multiple fused rings
- Oxygen-containing substituents
- Similar molecular size

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.82

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, and its similarity to other complex natural product-like structures in the training set.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.11688174839296955
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C has:
- A triazine ring (nnc)
- A thioether group (CSc)
- A carbonyl group (c(=O))
- A tert-butyl substituent (C(C)(C)C)
- An amino group (N)

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Molecules with heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen typically have negative values
2. The presence of sulfur and nitrogen atoms in a heterocyclic system tends to give values in the negative range
3. Similar structures like CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C had a value of -0.26150969
4. The tert-butyl group and thioether might slightly increase the value

Based on these observations and the structural similarities with other molecules in the training set, particularly other nitrogen-containing heterocycles and compounds with similar functional groups, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.31

This prediction takes into account the similar electronic and structural features seen in the training set, particularly the presence of the triazine ring, thioether, and tert-butyl group.

Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.33642650190913415
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate, which contains:
- An aromatic ring (benzene)
- An ester group (-COO-)
- An ethyl group (CC-)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with aromatic rings generally have negative or slightly negative values
- Esters (like CCCCCC(=O)OC) tend to have values around 0.48
- The presence of oxygen atoms tends to make values less positive
- Simple aromatic compounds with small substituents typically have values between -0.6 and 0.5

Considering these patterns and the specific structural features, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's more complex than simple aromatics (which would be more negative)
2. Contains an ester group (which tends to be slightly positive)
3. Has a similar complexity to other molecules in the training set with comparable functional groups
4. Is less complex than highly negative valued molecules in the training set

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 2.980968238396357
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCCCBr, 1-bromoheptane) by comparing it with the training examples and looking for patterns in molecular structure and corresponding property values.

Key observations:
1. The molecule is a straight-chain alkyl bromide
2. Similar halogenated compounds in the training set:
   - CI (iodide) has a value of 4.05772219
   - Other halogenated aromatics have lower values
3. The molecule has a long alkyl chain (7 carbons), similar to:
   - CCCCCCC=C (value: 0.94068764)
   - Other long-chain alkanes show moderate positive values

Considering these factors:
- The bromine will contribute less to the property than iodine (CI has 4.05)
- The long alkyl chain will contribute similarly to other alkyl chains in the dataset
- Bromine is less electronegative than chlorine but more than iodine
- The overall structure suggests a moderate positive value

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately:

1.85

This prediction takes into account both the halogen effect and the alkyl chain contribution while considering the relative electronegativity of bromine compared to other halogens in the training set.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.4075708577080217
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples. Let me break this down:

CO (methanol) is a very simple molecule with:
- One carbon atom
- One oxygen atom (alcohol group)
- Similar in simplicity to molecules like CCC (propane, 1.50328858)
- But more polar due to the OH group
- Smaller than molecules like CCC(C)CO (1.40757086)
- Similar functional group to OCC1OC(O)(CO)C(O)C1O (0.97926826) but much simpler

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
- Simple molecules tend to have positive values
- Alcohols tend to have values around 0.5-1.5
- Smaller molecules generally have lower values than their larger counterparts
- The presence of oxygen typically reduces the value compared to pure hydrocarbons

Based on these observations and the molecule's characteristics, I would predict the property value for CO (methanol) to be approximately:

0.74

This takes into account its small size, polarity, and the general trends observed in the training data, particularly for simple alcohols and small molecules.
