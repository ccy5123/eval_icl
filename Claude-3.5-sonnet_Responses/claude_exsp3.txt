SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 2.5242666667015006
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester of a long-chain fatty acid (methyl decanoate).

Looking at similar patterns in the training data:
1. CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl laurate) has a value of 2.62862929
2. Long chain hydrocarbons (like CCCCCC, CCCCCC(C)C) typically have values around 3.25460661
3. Shorter esters like CCOC(=O)CC have values around 1.79829257
4. CCCCCCC(=O)C (a ketone) has a value of 2.28113825

Given that this molecule:
- Is an ester like example 1, but with a slightly shorter chain
- Has a similar functional group arrangement
- Falls between the longer methyl laurate and shorter esters in terms of chain length

I predict the property value would be approximately 2.45

This prediction takes into account that:
- The value should be lower than methyl laurate (2.62862929) due to shorter chain length
- But higher than short chain esters
- The ester functional group typically reduces the value compared to pure hydrocarbons

3. A terminal alkene group

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a value of 0.04715765
- This is the most similar structure, also having the barbituric acid core and a terminal alkene group, but with a simpler substitution

The main difference is that our target molecule has a larger alkyl substituent (C(C)CCC) compared to just methyl (C) in the reference molecule.

Considering that:
1. The core structure is identical
2. The terminal alkene is present in both
3. The only difference is a slightly larger alkyl group
4. Larger alkyl groups tend to slightly increase the property value in the training set

I would predict a value of approximately 0.15-0.20 for this molecule, specifically:

0.17 as the predicted property value.

This prediction takes into account that the larger alkyl group should increase the value slightly compared to the reference molecule's 0.04715765, but not dramatically, as the core structure remains the same.

1. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S))
2. It has methoxy groups (OC) attached to phosphorus
3. It has an aromatic ring with methyl and methylthio substituents
4. The overall structure is similar to several organophosphate/organothiophosphate compounds in the training set

Based on these observations:
- The target molecule has a similar core structure to the PCBs in the training set
- It has multiple chlorine substituents on both aromatic rings
- All similar highly chlorinated aromatic compounds show the exact same value of -0.67449076

Therefore, I predict the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl to be:

-0.67449076

This prediction is based on the strong structural similarity to other polychlorinated compounds in the training set that consistently show this exact value.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule CCCN(=O)=O (propyl nitrite) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. It has a short carbon chain (propyl)
3. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - Simple alkanes (CCC) tend to have values around 3.25
   - Molecules with nitro groups tend to lower the value
   - Medium-sized molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups often have values between 0 and 2
   - The presence of N=O groups typically reduces the value compared to pure hydrocarbons

Based on these patterns and considering the molecule's size and functional groups, I would predict a property value of approximately 1.8

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's not as simple as a pure hydrocarbon (which would be higher)
- The nitro group will reduce the value from the hydrocarbon baseline
- It's still a relatively small molecule
- The presence of the oxygen-containing group puts it in a middle range

The predicted value: 1.80

Looking at patterns in the training data:
1. Simple alkyl chains (like CCCCC) tend to have values around 3.25

Looking at the examples and analyzing the given molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate), I notice it's very similar to some of the training examples, particularly:

CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate), which has a value of -0.30925613
CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1, which has a value of -0.30925613

The query molecule is a benzoic acid ester (specifically methyl benzoate), which is structurally very similar to ethyl benzoate, just differing by one methylene group. Given their high structural similarity and the fact that this small change shouldn't dramatically affect the property, I would predict the value to be very close to -0.30925613.

Therefore, I predict the property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 to be approximately -0.30925613.

This prediction is based on the principle of structural similarity and the observation that similar compounds in the training set have nearly identical values, particularly other benzoic acid esters.

2. Molecules with conjugated double bonds tend to have lower values
3. The target molecule C=CCC=C is a simple hydrocarbon with two double bonds

Analyzing C=CCC=C specifically:
- It's a small hydrocarbon (similar to some high-value examples)
- However, it has two double bonds
- It's somewhat similar to CC/C=C/C (which has value 0.80009715) but with an additional double bond
- The presence of multiple double bonds typically reduces the value compared to saturated analogs

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict the property value for C=CCC=C to be approximately:

0.75 - 0.85

More specifically, I would predict: 0.80009715

I chose this value because:
1. It matches exactly with the similar molecule CC/C=C/C
2. The additional double bond effect seems to be compensated by the small size of the molecule
3. This value fits within the general pattern observed for similar small, unsaturated hydrocarbons in the training set

Let me analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The molecule CC/C=C\C is a pentene (C5H10) with a trans (E) configuration at the double bond, as indicated by the '\' notation. 

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. There's a very similar molecule CC/C=C/C with a value of 0.80009715
2. The only difference is the geometry around the double bond (cis vs trans)
3. Small hydrocarbons generally have positive values in this dataset
4. The geometric isomerism typically doesn't cause dramatic changes in this property

Given that this molecule is the trans isomer of CC/C=C/C (which has a value of 0.80009715), and considering that trans/cis isomerism usually doesn't lead to dramatic property differences, I would predict a very similar value.

CCCOCC is a relatively simple aliphatic ether molecule with:
- A linear carbon chain
- An oxygen atom in the middle
- No cyclic structures, aromatics, or other functional groups
- Similar in simplicity to molecules like CCC(O)CC, CCSSCC, and simple alkanes in the training set

Looking at similar patterns in the training data:
- Simple aliphatic molecules often have higher values (around 2-3)
- Molecules with oxygen but maintaining aliphatic character tend to have values in the 2-3 range
- Similar simple structures like CC(C)O, CCC(O)CC have values around 3.25

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to other simple aliphatic molecules in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

2.00447284

This prediction takes into account that while it's a simple aliphatic molecule (which typically have higher values around 3.25), the presence of the ether oxygen might slightly moderate the value, similar to what we see with other simple oxygen-containing aliphatics in the training set.

1. CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (methylated phenol) has value 0.11590812
2. Oc1cccc(O)c1 (dihydroxybenzene) has value -0.67449076
3. Simple phenols generally have values around -0.67 to 0.12
4. The presence of methyl groups tends to increase the value slightly

Given that this molecule is:
- A phenol (has OH group)
- Has two methyl substituents
- Similar to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O but with slightly different substitution pattern

I would predict a value around 0.11 to 0.15, most likely:

0.11590812

This prediction is based on its very close structural similarity to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O from the training set, which has exactly this value. The slight differences in methyl group positions should not significantly affect the property value in this case.
