Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the given examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester of a long-chain fatty acid (methyl decanoate).

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Long chain hydrocarbons tend to have values around 0 to 1
2. Esters (compounds with C(=O)OC group) generally show negative values
3. Similar compounds in the training set:
   - CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl laurate) has a value of -0.6336562
   - CCCC(C)O (pentanol) has a value of 0.63982642

- A CC=C group

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a value of -0.80248104
- This is the most similar structure, differing only by having a longer alkyl chain

Other relevant patterns from the examples:

3. The CC=C group is present in both molecules
4. The overall polarity and size are similar

I predict the property value would be approximately: -0.78

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.6411765694550122
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (isopropyl formate, CC(C)OC=O) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule and comparing it to similar structures in the training set:

1. It's a small ester, similar to other simple esters in the training set
2. It contains a formate group (OC=O)
3. It has branching similar to isopropyl groups
4. Its size and complexity are relatively simple

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- CC(C)CCOC=O (similar ester) has value -0.09147695
- CCCCCOC(=O)C (longer ester) has value -0.36151285
- CC(C)(C)O (branched alcohol) has value 0.63982642

Considering these factors:
- The molecule is smaller than CC(C)CCOC=O but has similar functional groups

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.2149775940324681
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethylphenol (two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a benzene ring).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. Phenol (c1ccccc1O) has a value of 0.46269442
3. Methylated aromatics like Cc1cccc(C)c1 tend to have values around -0.17573238
4. Adding hydroxyl groups (-OH) to aromatic rings tends to slightly decrease the value
5. The molecule is relatively simple and doesn't contain any highly electronegative atoms like Cl or Br that tend to increase the value significantly

Given these observations, and considering that this molecule is structurally similar to phenol but with two additional methyl groups, I would predict a value around:

0.15

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's more complex than phenol but simpler than many of the high-value compounds
- The methyl groups would slightly modify the base phenol value
- The overall structure suggests a moderate value in the range we see for similar aromatic compounds

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.7058164002368403
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is an organophosphate compound with:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S))
- Two methoxy groups (OC)
- A phenoxy linkage
- A methylthio substituent (SC)
- A methyl substituent (C)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a value of 2.36615835
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has a value of 4.70971259
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has a value of 7.88882119

The target molecule has the same phosphorothioate and methoxy groups but differs in the aromatic substituents. Instead of halogen substituents, it has methylthio and methyl groups, which are generally less electronegative and would likely result in a lower value than the chlorinated/brominated/iodinated analogs.

Based on these comparisons and the overall structural similarities, I would predict a property value of approximately 2.15 for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1.

Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples.

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has several key characteristics:
1. It contains multiple chlorine atoms (5 Cl atoms)
2. It has a biphenyl-like structure (two benzene rings connected)
3. The chlorines are distributed across both rings
4. It's a relatively large, hydrophobic molecule

Looking at similar structures from the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl had a value of 4.40704128
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl had a value of 6.60885901

The target molecule is structurally similar to these examples but has fewer chlorine atoms (5 vs 6-7). The property values seem to increase with:
- Number of chlorine atoms
- Size of the molecule
- Degree of halogenation

Given that our molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than the reference molecules
- Similar biphenyl core structure
- Similar distribution of substituents

I would predict a value of approximately 3.8 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that the property value should be lower than the examples with more chlorine atoms but still significantly positive due to the presence of multiple halogens and the biphenyl structure.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobromobenzene with the substituents in meta position to each other.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of -0.78844464
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 and COc1ccccc1Cl have values around -0.54
- Other halogenated aromatics tend to have negative values
- Meta-substituted patterns seem to give slightly less negative values than para-substituted ones

Considering that:
1. Fluorine is less electronegative than chlorine
2. The meta position typically has different electronic effects than para
3. Bromine is present as in some of the reference compounds
4. The overall molecular weight and size is similar to the reference compounds

I would predict a value of approximately -0.65 for this molecule.

My specific prediction: -0.65214

This takes into account that the value should be:

1. The target molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic structure with:
- Two connected rings
- Multiple methyl substituents (C)
- One hydroxyl group (OH)
- Relatively compact and rigid structure

2. Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
- Molecules with bicyclic structures tend to have moderate positive values
- Presence of OH groups often contributes to slightly positive values
- Compact ring systems with methyl substituents generally show values between 0 and 2

3. Most similar examples from the training set:
- CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO (6.41130401) - more complex but similar core
- CC(C)(C)CO (0.63982642) - simpler but has similar features
- CC1CCCO1 (0.70233613) - single ring but similar substituent pattern

Based on these considerations and the structural patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 to be approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account the molecule's relatively simple bicyclic nature, the presence of the hydroxyl group, and the methyl substituents, while being more conservative than the values seen for more complex polycyclic structures in the training set.

- CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O has a value of 6.50677799
  This is very similar to our target molecule, just missing the SC(CCl) portion

3) Other relevant patterns from the training data:
- Molecules with P=S tend to have higher positive values
- Phthalimide-containing structures often have moderate values
- The presence of ethoxy groups typically doesn't drastically alter the property

4) Considering these factors:
- The structure is very similar to the reference compound (6.50677799)

- The removal of the SC(CCl) group would likely decrease the value somewhat

Based on this analysis, I would predict a value of approximately 4.2 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to the training compound while accounting for the reduced complexity and absence of the chlorinated portion.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.5673548388558513
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCC(=O)OCC - ethyl hexanoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Longer chain esters tend to have values around -0.7 to -0.8
2. Simple aliphatic compounds with similar chain lengths (like CCCCC) have values around 1.1-1.2
3. The presence of ester group (C(=O)O) typically reduces the value compared to pure alkanes

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I notice this molecule is a geometric isomer (Z-isomer) of CC/C=C/C (E-isomer) which has a known property value of 1.2454316.

The molecule CC/C=C\C is 2-pentene with a Z configuration, while CC/C=C/C is 2-pentene with an E configuration.

1. Molecules containing bromine generally have values around -0.7 to -0.8 (e.g., Fc1cccc(Br)c1: -0.79407363)
2. Aromatic amides tend to have slightly negative values
3. Para-substituted phenyl rings with electron-withdrawing groups show values in the -0.2 to -0.8 range
4. The presence of an acetyl group (CC(=O)-) tends to make the value more negative

Considering these patterns and the structural similarity to several examples, particularly the brominated aromatics and acetylated compounds, I would predict the property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 to be approximately:

-0.65

This prediction takes into account the combined effects of the bromine substituent, the acetamide group, and the aromatic system, while considering the general trends observed in the training set.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.801786761686505
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally very similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training examples, which has a value of -0.80248068. 

The only difference is that our target molecule has an N-N single bond instead of an N=N double bond. This typically means:
1. Slightly more flexibility in the molecule
2. Slightly different electronic distribution
3. Similar overall size and shape
4. Very similar aromatic system contribution

Given these considerations and the high structural similarity to the reference molecule, I would predict a value very close to but slightly different from -0.80248068.

My prediction for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is: -0.78

This prediction takes into account that the single bond versus double bond difference would likely cause a small but noticeable change in the property value, while maintaining the overall characteristic behavior of this class of compounds.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has the following key features:
1. It contains three chlorine atoms
2. It has two benzene rings connected directly (biphenyl structure)
3. The chlorines are distributed between both rings

- Complex chlorinated aromatics like Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has value 4.04108541
- Biphenyl-like structures tend to have values around 0 to 2

Given that this molecule:
- Is more complex than simple dichlorobenzene
- Has three chlorines (more than dichlorobenzene but less than the pentachloro compound)
- Has a biphenyl core structure
- Is less chlorinated than the 4.04 example but more than the -0.60 example

I would predict a value of approximately 1.85 for this molecule.

True Property: -0.4273022894216051
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule is simpler than CCCCCCc1ccccc1 (which has a longer alkyl chain), but has two ethyl groups instead of one substituent like in Cc1ccccc1N.

Based on these observations and the symmetrical nature of the molecule, I would predict a value around:

-0.31

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's a relatively simple aromatic compound
- It has moderate lipophilicity due to the two ethyl groups
- It's more symmetrical than most of the training examples
- The value should be between the highly substituted and simple benzene derivatives in the training set

2. The most similar structure in the examples is "c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54" (pentacene) which has a value very close to 0 (-1.144e-05)
3. "Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32" (methylanthracene) has a value of -0.78589939

Given that pyrene:
- Is a smaller and more compact PAH than pentacene
- Has similar electron delocalization properties
- Is more symmetric than methylanthracene
- Has fewer rings than some of the other PAH examples

I would predict a property value of approximately -0.45

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 1.033078539546866
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule and the given examples, I notice this is a complex natural product-like structure with multiple hydroxyl groups and a flavonoid-like core structure. Looking at the patterns in the training examples:

1. Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (-OH) tend to have lower values
2. Fused ring systems generally contribute to moderate values
3. The presence of oxygen atoms in rings tends to slightly decrease the value
4. Phenolic structures (aromatic rings with -OH groups) typically lead to values in the moderate range

Given these structural features and comparing to similar structures in the training set, particularly considering:
- The multiple hydroxyl groups (like in the examples with phenolic compounds)
- The fused ring system (similar to some flavonoid-like structures in the training set)
- The overall size and complexity of the molecule

I would predict a property value of approximately 0.85 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has features that would both increase the property (ring systems, ketone) and decrease it (multiple hydroxyl groups), leading to a moderate positive value.

Iteration: 56
SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: -0.8023211546638214

- Smaller molecules generally have lower values
- Presence of S and N atoms often leads to moderate values
- Acetamide-containing compounds often show slightly negative to moderate positive values

Considering these factors and comparing with the most similar structures in the training set (particularly phosphate-containing compounds), I would predict a property value of approximately:

1.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's size, functional groups, and similarity to other phosphate-containing compounds in the training set, while considering that it's smaller and less complex than many of the higher-value examples.

2. The example most similar to our target molecule is: "Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" which has a value of 15.536877

Our target molecule "Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl" is similar but has fewer chlorine atoms (6 Cl atoms vs 10 Cl atoms in the example).

Considering:
- It has a similar biphenyl core structure
- It has 6 chlorine substituents
- The chlorines are distributed across both aromatic rings
- The structure maintains similar electronic effects

I would predict a value of approximately 9.32

This prediction is based on:
1. The proportional relationship between number of chlorines
2. The similar core structure
3. The observed trend that heavily chlorinated aromatics give high positive values
4. The fact that it should be lower than 15.536877 due to fewer chlorines but still significantly positive

- CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO (value: 6.41130401)

The target molecule shares structural similarities with these steroids, particularly the first one. However, it has some key differences:

- The size and complexity is moderate

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account the moderating effect of the polar carbamate group on what would otherwise be a more positive value due to the chlorine atoms and alkyne group.

1. The molecule ClCCl is very similar to ClCCCl in the training set, which has a value of 0.32726077
2. It's a small, symmetric molecule with two chlorine atoms
3. It's slightly smaller than ClCCCl by one carbon
4. Other small halogenated compounds in the training set tend to have values around 0 to 0.5

Given these observations, I would predict that ClCCl would have a property value close to, but slightly lower than ClCCCl (0.32726077), since it's smaller by one carbon.

My prediction for ClCCl is: 0.28

This takes into account:
- The similarity to ClCCCl
- The general trend of small halogenated compounds
- The slightly smaller molecular size
- The symmetrical nature of the molecule

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.214977594032469
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples and molecular patterns.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a dimethylphenol (specifically, a dimethyl-substituted phenol).

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (-0.63587398) - very similar structure with methyl groups and hydroxyl
- Oc1cccc(O)c1 (0.04476023) - similar core structure but with different substitution
- c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC (-0.77861689) - contains phenol group with substitutions

The target molecule has:
1. A phenol core structure
2. Two methyl groups
3. Similar size and complexity to some reference molecules
4. Similar polarity pattern to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O

Given that the most structurally similar molecule (CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O) has a value of -0.63587398, and considering the slight differences in substitution patterns, I would predict the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O to be approximately:

-0.62

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly simpler than the closest reference compound but maintains similar electronic and steric properties.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 1.164688218138481
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the target molecule, I'll make a prediction based on several key observations:

1) The target molecule contains multiple chlorine atoms (4 Cls) and has a biphenyl-like structure

2) Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cls) has value 4.40704128
- Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (5 Cls) has value 2.59231768

3) The target molecule has:
- 4 chlorine atoms (less than both reference molecules)
- Similar biphenyl core structure
- Similar substitution pattern but less chlorinated

4) The property appears to:
- Increase with number of chlorine atoms
- Be influenced by molecular size and symmetry
- Show higher values for more halogenated compounds

Based on these observations, I would predict a value between 2.5 and 3.5, specifically:

Predicted value: 3.12

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has fewer chlorines than the 6-Cl compound (4.41) but more than some other chlorinated aromatics in the training set, and maintains the basic biphenyl structure that seems to contribute to higher values.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 1.2454315975582577
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (2-methylbut-2-ene) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice that:
1. Smaller, simpler molecules tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. Molecules with simple carbon chains and one double bond tend to have slightly negative values
3. Branched alkenes show similar patterns to linear ones but with slightly less negative values
4. The presence of methyl groups (C) tends to make the value less negative

The target molecule CC=C(C)C is:
- A small, branched alkene
- Contains 5 carbons total
- Has one double bond
- Has two methyl groups on the same carbon of the double bond
- Is relatively symmetric and compact

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- CCCCCCCCC=C (linear decene) has -0.51596508
- Simple hydrocarbons like CCCCCCCC have values around -0.04934264
- Branched structures tend to be less negative than their linear counterparts

Based on these observations and the molecule's structural features, I predict the property value for CC=C(C)C to be approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account that it's smaller than most examples, has branching that would reduce the negative value, and contains a double bond that typically contributes to a slightly negative value.

Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.7402055687148388
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (dichloromethane, CH2Cl2) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple, small molecules tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. Highly chlorinated compounds tend to have higher positive values
3. Similar small halogenated compounds in the training set like CCl4 (ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl) has a value of -0.75889935

For ClCCl (CH2Cl2):
- It's a very small molecule
- Has two chlorine atoms (less than CCl4)
- Is more polar than CCl4
- Has similar structural features to CCl4 but with fewer chlorines
- Is simpler and smaller than most molecules in the training set

Based on these observations and considering that CCl4 has a value of -0.75889935, I would predict that CH2Cl2 (ClCCl) would have a value around:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It should be negative like similar halogenated compounds
2. The magnitude should be less than CCl4 due to fewer chlorines
3. Its small size and simplicity suggest a moderate value

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.7644484919058492
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms at positions 2,4,6 and a hydroxyl group.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (very similar, just different chlorine positions) has value -0.76444849
2. Other halogenated aromatics like Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 has value 2.06679222
3. Chlorinated compounds generally show moderate positive to negative values

The target molecule is most similar to Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which is essentially the same compound with just slightly different chlorine positioning. Given their very similar structure (same number of chlorines, same hydroxyl group, same basic scaffold), I would expect the property value to be very close to -0.76444849.

Taking into account the slight differences in chlorine positioning might cause minor variations, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.75

This prediction is based primarily on the very close structural analog in the training set, with only minimal adjustment for the different substitution pattern.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 26.13799590878186
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the given molecule, I notice:
1. It's a complex natural product-like structure
2. Contains multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters)
3. Has a methylenedioxy group (OCO)
4. Contains multiple rings including aromatic and aliphatic systems
5. Has multiple stereocenters
6. Contains hydroxyl groups
7. Has significant molecular weight and complexity

Analyzing the training examples:
- Simpler molecules tend to have values between -1 and 1
- Complex molecules with multiple rings and oxygen atoms tend to have higher positive values
- Molecules with similar structural features (multiple oxygens, fused rings) show values around 3-5
- Natural product-like structures with similar complexity (like steroids) show values around 2-4

Given the structural complexity, presence of multiple oxygen-containing groups, and similarity to some of the larger natural product-like molecules in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

3.42

This prediction takes into account the molecule's similarity to other complex oxygen-containing structures in the training set while considering its unique structural features.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.6342329771832531
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples.

Looking at the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, I notice:
1. It contains a heterocyclic ring with multiple nitrogen atoms
2. Has a thioether (CSc-) group
3. Contains a carbonyl group
4. Has a t-butyl substituent (C(C)(C)C)
5. Has an amino substituent (-N)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a value of 0.09449317
- This is particularly relevant as it also contains an nnc ring system and a t-butyl group
- Other heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen atoms tend to have values between -0.7 and 0.1

Based on these observations and the structural similarities, particularly with the compound containing the nnc ring system and t-butyl group, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.15 to -0.25

My specific prediction would be: -0.21

This takes into account that the molecule has similar structural elements to compounds in the training set but is slightly more polar due to the amino group, which tends to decrease the value somewhat compared to the similar reference compound.

Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6354148911186104
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ethyl benzoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. The molecule contains an ester group (-C(=O)OC-)
2. It has a benzene ring
3. It's relatively small and simple compared to many examples
4. Similar compounds with ester groups (like CCCC(=O)OC and CCCCC(=O)OCC) have values around -0.36
5. The presence of the benzene ring might slightly modify this value

Considering these factors, and comparing with similar structures in the training set, particularly other esters and aromatic compounds, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.32

This prediction takes into account:
- The similar ester-containing molecules in the training set
- The presence of the aromatic ring
- The overall size and complexity of the molecule
- The general trend that simple aromatic esters tend to have values in this range

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.8009355298421212
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCCCBr, 1-bromoheptane) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple linear molecules tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. Halogenated compounds (especially bromine) often have slightly negative values
3. Longer carbon chains tend to move the value closer to zero or slightly negative
4. The molecule is similar in structure to CCCCCCC=C from the examples (-0.00398813), just with Br instead of =C

Considering these factors, and particularly comparing it to similar structures in the training set:
- It's a linear molecule like many examples
- It has a bromine terminal group
- It has a 7-carbon chain
- It's similar to the CCCCCCC=C example but with Br instead of =C

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account the slightly negative influence of bromine while considering the stabilizing effect of the longer carbon chain.
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 2.874654882061472
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

CO (methanol) is one of the simplest organic molecules containing a single carbon with a hydroxyl group. Looking at the training examples, I observe that:

1. Small molecules generally have lower values
2. Alcohols (-OH containing compounds) tend to have slightly negative or small positive values
3. Simple aliphatic compounds with few carbons tend to have values between -0.2 and 0.6

Comparing specifically with similar structures in the training set:
- CCC (propane) has 2.30786246
- CCCCOC=O (longer chain with oxygen) has 0.24275286
- CCC(C)CO (branched alcohol) has 0.63982642
- Simple alcohols like OC1CCCCCC1 has -0.04836692

Given that CO (methanol) is:
- Smaller than most examples
- Contains an OH group
- Has just one carbon
- Is a simple alcohol

I would predict a value of approximately 0.15 for CO.

This prediction takes into account that methanol is simpler than most molecules in the training set, but still contains an oxygen atom which tends to reduce the value compared to pure hydrocarbons.
