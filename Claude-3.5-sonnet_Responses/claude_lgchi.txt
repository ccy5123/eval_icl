SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -0.751005800956054
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 has several key features:
1. Contains a sulfonamide group -S(=O)(=O)-
2. Has an aromatic ring (benzene)
3. Contains multiple amino groups (-NH2)
4. Has a guanidine-like structure (-NC(=N)N-)
5. Is relatively polar due to multiple N atoms and SO2 group

Looking at the training examples:
- Molecules with polar groups tend to have values closer to 0 or slightly negative
- Sulfonamide-containing compounds in the training set show moderate values
- Amino-substituted aromatics typically have values between -0.7 and 0.6
- The presence of multiple polar groups tends to pull values toward the middle range

Based on these observations and the structural features, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.28

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate polarity, the presence of both aromatic and polar functional groups, and its similarity to other compounds in the training set with comparable functional groups.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.3624700293157193
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains several key structural features:
- Tertiary amine (CCN)
- Nitro groups (N(=O)=O)
- Trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)
- Alkene group (CC(C)=C)
- Substituted benzene ring

2. Looking at patterns in the training data:
- Molecules with nitro groups tend to have values around 0 to 0.5
- Presence of fluorine atoms often increases the value
- Complex substituted aromatics typically have values between -1 and 1
- Multiple polar groups tend to push values higher

3. Considering similar structures from the training set:
- The molecule shares some similarities with other substituted aromatics
- The combination of electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and CF3) is unique
- The tertiary amine with an alkene substituent is a distinctive feature

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I predict the property value to be:

0.83

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, polarity, and the combined effects of its various functional groups.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.49185007490663585
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (isopropyl formate, CC(C)OC=O) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Similar sized molecules tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. Molecules with ester groups (OC=O) tend to have slightly negative to slightly positive values
3. Simple branched alcohols and esters show values around -0.1 to 0.5
4. The closest structural analogs in the training set are:
   - CC(C)CCOC=O (-0.12864119)
   - CCCCCOC(=O)C (-0.75578423)
   - Simple esters and branched structures with similar size

Given these observations and considering that CC(C)OC=O is:
- A small ester
- Has branching (isopropyl group)
- Simpler than most examples
- Similar to but smaller than CC(C)CCOC=O

I predict the property value would be approximately: -0.15

This prediction takes into account that it should be slightly negative like similar esters, but not as negative as larger molecules in the training set.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.24591436406590253
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethylphenol (two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a benzene ring).

Looking at the patterns in the training set:
1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. Phenols (like c1ccccc1O) have values around 0.35
3. Adding methyl groups to aromatic rings tends to shift values slightly
4. The complexity and size of the molecule affects the value
5. Similar structures like methylated phenols in the training set show moderate values

Considering these factors:
- The base phenol structure (c1ccccc1O) has a value of 0.34570381
- The addition of two methyl groups will likely shift this value slightly
- The molecule is relatively simple compared to many in the training set
- The substitution pattern suggests moderate electronic effects

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 to be approximately:

0.28

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to phenol while accounting for the electronic and steric effects of the two methyl groups.

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 1.1471371195811781
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples and structural patterns.

The target molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is an organophosphate compound with sulfur, similar to several examples in the training set. Let's analyze key similarities:

1. It contains the COP(=S)(OC)O- group, which appears in several training examples like COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (0.91432163)

2. The aromatic ring substitution pattern is different from the examples but has similar electronic properties:
- It has a methylthio (SC) group instead of chlorines
- It has a methyl (C) group as a substituent
- The substitution pattern is para/meta instead of the di/tri-chloro patterns seen in examples

3. The overall molecular size and complexity is similar to the other organophosphate compounds in the training set

Looking at the closest analogues:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl = 0.91432163
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl = 1.14158261
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl = 1.0539911

The methylthio and methyl substituents would make this compound slightly less electronegative than the chlorinated analogues, but maintain similar lipophilicity.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value would be approximately:

0.95

This value reflects that the compound should have a property value similar to but slightly higher than the trichloro analogue (0.91432163), but lower than the iodo analogue (1.14158261), due to the electronic and steric effects of the SC and CH3 substituents.

True Property: 0.39793561854911175
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1) The target molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 5 chlorine atoms.

2) Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl atoms) has value 0.63682616
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (7 Cl atoms) has value 0.83859053

3) Our target molecule has:
- Similar biphenyl core structure
- 5 Cl atoms (intermediate between some examples)
- Similar substitution pattern
- Similar molecular size

4) Considering these factors:
- The property values for similar PCBs are in the 0.6-0.8 range
- Having fewer chlorines than the reference compounds would likely decrease the value slightly
- The specific substitution pattern is somewhat similar

Based on this analysis, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.58 for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl.

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Lower than the 6-Cl compound (0.63682616)
- Significantly lower than the 7-Cl compound (0.83859053)
- But still positive and in a similar range due to structural similarity

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.47829557861382865
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O, propyl nitrite) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. It has a short carbon chain (3 carbons)
3. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - Simple alkanes (like CCC) tend to have values around 0.7
   - Molecules with nitro groups (like those in the training set) tend to decrease the value
   - The size and complexity is relatively low
   - Oxygen-containing molecules often show lower values than pure hydrocarbons

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, particularly considering:
- The presence of the nitro group which typically reduces the value
- The short carbon chain which would normally contribute positively
- Similar sized molecules with oxygen-containing groups

I would predict a value of approximately -0.15 for CCCN(=O)=O.

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is neither very complex nor very simple, and the nitro group typically has a reducing effect on the property value based on the patterns observed in the training data.

True Property: -0.28044722361783236
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a benzene ring substituted with fluorine and bromine in different positions.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of -0.70901166
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 and similar dihalogenated benzenes have values around -0.3
- Brominated aromatics generally show negative values
- The presence of fluorine typically leads to slightly less negative values compared to chlorine

Considering these patterns:
1. The molecule is similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 but with F instead of Cl
2. Fluorine typically has a smaller effect than chlorine
3. The meta substitution pattern (vs para in some training examples) might affect the value slightly

Based on these considerations, I would predict a value of approximately -0.45 for Fc1cccc(Br)c1.

This prediction takes into account that the value should be:
- Negative (like most halogenated aromatics)
- Less negative than Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.70901166)
- In the range of other dihalogenated benzenes

True Property: -1.6759456647821604
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The target molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic structure with:
- A bridged bicyclic system
- Two methyl groups (gem-dimethyl)
- A hydroxyl group (-OH)
- Relatively compact and rigid structure

2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Most bicyclic/polycyclic structures tend to have values between 0.5 and 2.0
- Presence of OH groups tends to moderate the values
- Compact ring systems generally give positive values
- Similar complexity level to some of the steroid-like structures in the training set, though simpler

3. Key comparisons:
- It's simpler than the steroid structures (which have values around 1.4-1.8)
- More complex than simple cyclic ethers (which have values around 0.1-0.3)
- The OH group and compact structure suggest a moderate positive value

Based on these considerations and patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.48

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, presence of OH group, and bicyclic nature, while acknowledging it's simpler than the larger steroid-like structures in the training set.

1. A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
2. A phthalimide ring system
3. Ethoxy groups attached to phosphorus
4. Similar structure to some of the training examples, particularly the one containing phthalimide and phosphorothioate groups

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O (1.86871553) is very similar, just missing the CCl and S bridge
- Other molecules containing aromatic rings with oxygen-containing substituents tend to have values between -2 and 2
- The presence of P=S group typically contributes to higher positive values
- Phthalimide-containing structures generally show moderate positive values

Based on these observations and the structural similarities, particularly with the closest analog in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

1.65

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly less complex than its closest analog in the training set (which had 1.86871553), but maintains many of the key structural features that contribute to the property value.

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -2.260470737691918
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a pyrazolone derivative with:
- A pyrazolone core (5-membered heterocycle with N-N and C=O)
- Phenyl substitution on one nitrogen
- Methyl groups on both the ring and the other nitrogen
- Conjugated system

Looking at similar structures in the training set:

3. N-phenyl substitutions typically don't push values to extremes
4. Multiple nitrogen atoms in heterocycles tend to moderate the value

Considering these factors and comparing with similar molecules in the training set (especially those with heterocyclic cores and phenyl substitutions), I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.15 to 0.25

My specific prediction would be: 0.21

This takes into account the moderate size of the molecule, its aromatic character, the presence of the C=O group, and the N-phenyl substitution pattern.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -2.0409957692367064
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCC(=O)OCC - ethyl hexanoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule and comparing it with similar structures in the training set:

1. It's an ester (contains C(=O)OC group)
2. Has a medium-length linear carbon chain
3. Similar compounds in the training set:
- CCOC(=O)N (0.57442076)
- COC=O (0.9078687)
- CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (-1.15946146)

Considering these factors:
- Esters generally show moderate positive to negative values
- Longer chain esters tend to have more negative values than shorter ones
- This molecule is intermediate in length between the examples shown
- The ethyl group at the ester end vs methyl affects the value slightly

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCCCCC(=O)OCC to be approximately:

True Property: -0.2660619164396879
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and molecular structure patterns.

The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is methyl benzoate, which consists of:
- A benzene ring (c1ccccc1)
- A carboxylate ester group (COC(=O))

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) has a value of -1.00727542
- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 has a value of -1.26670695

The target molecule is very similar to ethyl benzoate, just with a methyl ester instead of an ethyl ester. The difference between methyl and ethyl usually causes a small change in the property value. Since methyl is slightly smaller than ethyl, and considering the patterns in the data, I would predict the value to be slightly less negative than ethyl benzoate.

My predicted value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately: -0.95

This prediction takes into account:
1. The high structural similarity to ethyl benzoate
2. The general trends seen in the training data
3. The effect of methyl vs ethyl substitution
4. The presence of the aromatic ring and ester functional group

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. Molecules with conjugated double bonds often have slightly higher values than saturated ones
3. Small, simple molecules generally have moderate values
4. The presence of C=C bonds seems to contribute to slightly positive values (as seen in CC/C=C/C at 0.40588929)

C=CCC=C is a small hydrocarbon with two terminal double bonds. It's similar in size and partially similar in structure to CC/C=C/C (pent-2-ene) from the examples, which has a value of 0.40588929.

Given that this molecule:
- Is a small hydrocarbon (suggesting moderate values)
- Has two double bonds instead of one (suggesting slightly higher activity)
- Has a similar carbon chain length to some reference compounds
- Shows some structural similarity to pent-2-ene

I predict the property value would be approximately 0.45

This prediction takes into account that the additional double bond might increase the value slightly compared to pent-2-ene, but the overall molecular size and type keeps it in a similar range.

- Other chlorinated aromatics tend to have negative values
- Larger, more complex structures tend to have values between -1 and -2

Considering these patterns and the structural features of our target molecule, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-1.15

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.4058892894111999
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this problem as a chemist:

1) The target molecule CC/C=C\C is a pentene (C5H10) with a trans (E) configuration at the double bond, while one of the example molecules CC/C=C/C is the same compound but with a cis (Z) configuration.

2) Looking at the examples, I notice that:
- The cis isomer (CC/C=C/C) has a property value of 0.40588929
- Small hydrocarbon molecules generally have values between -1 and 1
- The stereochemistry (cis/trans) can affect the property, but usually not drastically for small molecules

3) Given that:
- The molecules are identical except for stereochemistry
- Trans isomers are generally slightly more stable than cis isomers
- The difference in properties between cis/trans isomers is usually small

4) Based on these considerations, I would predict that the trans isomer (CC/C=C\C) would have a property value close to, but slightly different from its cis counterpart.

I predict the property value for CC/C=C\C to be approximately 0.38

This prediction takes into account that the trans isomer might have a slightly lower value than the cis isomer due to its different spatial arrangement, while maintaining a similar magnitude given the molecular similarity.

CCCOCC is a relatively simple linear ether with:
- 5 carbons in total
- 1 oxygen atom
- No cyclic structures
- No multiple bonds
- Similar in size to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

Comparing it specifically to similar molecules in the training set:
- It's simpler than most ethers shown

- Its structure suggests a moderate value

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict the property value for CCCOCC to be approximately:

0.32

This prediction takes into account the molecule's simplicity, the presence of the ether linkage, and its linear structure, placing it in a moderate range between the higher values of simple hydrocarbons and the lower values of more complex oxygenated compounds.

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, which is isobutylbenzene) by comparing it with the training examples and looking for structural similarities and patterns.

Key observations:
1. It's a benzene ring with a branched alkyl substituent
2. Similar compounds in the training set include:

- Similar overall size and hydrophobicity

Considering these factors:
1. It's slightly larger than ethyltoluene (-0.72507491)
2. But smaller than p-cymene (-1.417283)
3. The branching pattern is similar to p-cymene but with different positioning

Based on these structural relationships and the observed property values, I would predict a value of approximately:

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.16086821158559877
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice that:
1. Simple aromatic structures tend to have values closer to zero
2. The presence of oxygen atoms generally moves values slightly positive
3. Small molecules with a single functional group tend to have moderate values
4. The aldehyde group (C=O) appears to have a modest effect on the property

Analyzing benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1):
- It has a simple benzene ring
- Contains one aldehyde group
- Relatively small molecule
- Similar in complexity to some reference molecules like COc1ccccc1 (0.10099994)
- More polar than simple aromatics due to the aldehyde group

Considering these factors and comparing to similar structures in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -2.5580835433305533
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains a furan ring (5-membered oxygen heterocycle) with a nitro group
2. It has a cyclic urea structure (hydantoin-like)
3. There's a hydrazone linkage connecting these parts
4. The overall structure contains both electron-withdrawing groups (nitro, carbonyl) and electron-rich regions

Looking at the training examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups tend to have values around -0.1 to 0.4
- Heterocyclic structures often show values in the -0.5 to 0.5 range
- The presence of multiple polar groups tends to push values toward the negative
- Similar sized molecules with multiple heteroatoms typically fall in this range

Based on these patterns and the structural features, I predict the property value to be approximately:

True Property: -1.9932012939027386
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is very similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training set, which has a value of -2.48309048. The only difference is that our target molecule has an NH linkage instead of a N=N linkage.

Key observations:
1. Both molecules have two phenyl rings
2. Both have nitrogen atoms connecting the rings
3. The main difference is the saturation of the N-N bond
4. Both are relatively symmetric molecules

Given that:
- The presence of NH typically makes molecules slightly more polar than N=N
- The overall structural similarity is very high
- The electronic distribution would be similar
- The molecular size and shape are nearly identical

I would predict a value close to but slightly different from -2.48309048. 

My prediction for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be approximately: -2.35

This prediction takes into account that the NH linkage might slightly modify the property while maintaining the overall characteristic of the molecule that leads to a strongly negative value.

Looking at the given examples and the target molecule, I notice this is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure, similar to some of the examples provided. The molecule contains multiple chlorine substituents on a biphenyl core structure.

Analyzing patterns in the training data:
1. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings tend to have positive values
2. Biphenyl-like structures generally show values between 0.5 and 1.5
3. The most similar structure in the training set is "Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" with value 1.29582297

The target molecule has:
- 6 chlorine atoms (slightly fewer than the similar example)
- Biphenyl core structure

Looking at the training set, I notice:
1. The molecule ClCCl is very similar to ClCCCl in the training set, which has a value of 0.36309076
2. It's a small, symmetric molecule with two chlorine atoms
3. It's slightly smaller than ClCCCl (one carbon less)
4. Other small halogenated compounds in the training set tend to have values around 0.3-0.4

Given these observations, I would predict that ClCCl would have a property value close to but slightly different from ClCCCl. Since it's smaller but maintains similar electronic properties, I would expect the value to be slightly higher than ClCCCl.

My prediction for ClCCl is: 0.41

This prediction takes into account:
- The similarity to ClCCCl (0.36309076)
- The general trend of small halogenated compounds in the dataset
- The effect of molecular size on the property
- The symmetric nature of the molecule

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.25707466806407114
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples and molecular patterns.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a dimethylphenol (specifically, a dimethyl-substituted phenol with two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a benzene ring).

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
1. CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (-1.81918561) - Very similar structure with methyl groups and hydroxyl
2. Oc1cccc(O)c1 (0.26663563) - Similar core structure but with two hydroxyls
3. c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC (-0.58981051) - Has hydroxyl group but different substitution pattern

The target molecule is most similar to the first example, CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, which has a value of -1.81918561. While the substitution pattern is slightly different, the key structural features (two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on benzene) are the same.

Considering these factors and the overall trend in the dataset, I predict the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O to be approximately:

-1.75

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The molecule has similar electronic and steric properties to the closest analog
2. The positioning of the methyl groups is slightly different, which might cause a small variation
3. The overall molecular size and composition is very similar to the reference compound

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.09597169105978369
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 4 chlorine atoms. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl atoms) has value 0.63682616
2. Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (5 Cl atoms) has value 0.40445131
3. Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl (4 Cl atoms, but different core) has value -2.56331657

The target molecule is most similar to the first two examples, but has fewer chlorine atoms. The property appears to correlate with the number and position of chlorine atoms on the biphenyl core.

Given that:
- It has fewer chlorines than example 1 (which has 0.637)
- But similar to example 2 (which has 0.404)
- And maintains the biphenyl core structure

I predict the property value would be approximately 0.45

Therefore, my predicted value is: 0.45

This takes into account the structural similarity to the training examples while considering the reduced number of chlorine substituents compared to the most similar molecules in the training set.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.4897168248292955
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (2-methylbut-2-ene) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice several patterns:
1. Smaller, simpler molecules tend to have values between -2 and 0
2. Highly saturated linear hydrocarbons (like CCCCCCCC) have values around -1.85
3. Simple alkenes tend to have slightly more negative values than their saturated counterparts
4. Branching and methyl substitutions tend to make the values less negative
5. The presence of double bonds in simple structures tends to contribute to values in the -1 to -2 range

For CC=C(C)C:
- It's a small, branched alkene
- Has 5 carbons total
- Contains one double bond
- Has two methyl branches
- Similar in complexity to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

Considering these factors and comparing to similar structures in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-1.15

This prediction takes into account that it's a relatively simple molecule (pushing it towards more negative values) but has branching and a double bond (making it less negative than fully saturated linear hydrocarbons).

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.6157838526221131
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a very small molecule with just two carbons
2. It has two chlorine atoms
3. It's symmetric
4. It has no complex functional groups
5. Looking at similar small, halogenated compounds in the training set:
   - ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a value of 0.10466929
   - Other small chlorinated compounds tend to have values between -0.5 and 0.5

Based on these observations, and considering that ClCCl is simpler and smaller than most molecules in the training set, but shares some characteristics with other chlorinated compounds, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.15

This prediction takes into account that:
- The molecule is small and symmetric (which tends to give moderate values)
- It contains chlorine atoms (which seem to contribute slightly positive values in the training set)
- It's simpler than most reference compounds
- It's similar to but smaller than ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl which has a value of ~0.10

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -1.043314942092728
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples provided.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with the following key features:
1. A phenol core structure (hydroxyl group on benzene)
2. Three chlorine substituents
3. Similar to example Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl which has a value of -1.03264228

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
- Halogenated aromatics tend to have negative values
- The very similar compound Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl differs only in chlorine position
- Multiple halogens on aromatic rings generally push values toward negative range
- Phenols with substituents tend to have values in the -0.5 to -1.5 range

Given these observations and particularly the strong similarity to the reference compound, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.98

This prediction takes into account that the slight change in chlorine positioning would likely have a minor effect on the property value compared to the reference compound.

True Property: 2.162292055250614
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains multiple key structural features:
- Multiple methoxy groups (OC)
- A phenol group (OH)
- Multiple ether linkages
- A lactone ring (COC=O)
- Multiple fused rings
- A methylenedioxy group (OCO)
- Several stereocenters
- Multiple oxygen-containing substituents

2. Looking at the training examples:
- Complex molecules with multiple rings and oxygen-containing groups tend to have values between 0.5 and 1.5
- Natural product-like structures with multiple stereocenters often show positive values
- The presence of sugar-like moieties (as seen in some examples) tends to contribute to positive values
- Molecules with similar complexity and oxygen content show values around 0.6-1.0

3. This specific molecule resembles a natural product with its complex structure and multiple oxygen-containing functional groups.

Based on these considerations and pattern matching with the training examples, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.84

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, oxygen content, and structural similarity to several of the training examples, particularly those containing sugar-like moieties and fused ring systems.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.41989385649545286
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given training examples.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A heterocyclic ring with multiple nitrogen atoms
- A thioether (CS-) group
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)
- An amino substituent (-N)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a value of 0.22294499 and shares some similar features (nnc, C(C)(C)C group)
- Other heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen atoms tend to have values around -0.2 to 0.5
- The presence of the thioether group and tert-butyl group typically contributes to a slightly positive value

Considering these factors and the overall molecular structure, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.15 to 0.25

My specific prediction is: 0.19

This takes into account the structural similarities with known compounds while considering the specific substituents present in this molecule.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -1.0072754241941122
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ethyl benzoate) and predict its property value based on the given training examples.

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. The molecule contains an ester group (-C(=O)OC-)
2. It has a benzene ring
3. It's relatively small and has a simple substitution pattern
4. Similar compounds with ester groups tend to have values around -0.7 to -0.8
5. The presence of the benzene ring typically shifts values slightly

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- CCCCC(=O)OCC (ethyl pentanoate) has a value of -0.84471038
- CCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl hexanoate) has a value of -0.71838083
- Simple aromatic compounds tend to have slightly more negative values

Taking all these factors into consideration, and noting that this molecule combines both an ester group and an aromatic ring, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.92

This prediction takes into account the structural features and patterns observed in the training set while considering the combined effects of the aromatic ring and ester functionality.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -1.9008609657090523
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCCCBr, 1-bromoheptane) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Similar halogenated alkanes tend to have negative values
2. Longer chain alkyl compounds generally have values between -1 and -4
3. The closest structural analogs in the training set are:
   - CCCCCCC=C (-0.93780326)
   - CCCCCCCO (-0.93736184)
   - Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (-4.62521034)

The target molecule CCCCCCCBr is a straight-chain alkyl bromide. It's most similar to the first two analogs listed above, which both have values around -0.94. While the bromonaphthalene has a much more negative value, it's not as good a comparison due to its aromatic structure.

Considering that:
1. The molecule has a similar chain length to CCCCCCC=C
2. Br is generally similar to other terminal functional groups in terms of its effect on this property
3. The values for similar straight-chain compounds cluster around -1

I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately: -0.95

This prediction takes into account both the structural similarity to other straight-chain compounds and the general trends observed in the dataset.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.0537880379128517
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and the given examples to predict the property value for methanol (CO).

Looking at the training examples, I notice several patterns:
1. Small, simple molecules tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. Alcohols (-OH containing compounds) generally have negative or small positive values
3. The simplest molecules in the set (like CCC) have moderate positive values
4. Molecules with oxygen tend to reduce the value somewhat compared to pure hydrocarbons

Methanol (CO) is:
- A very small molecule
- Contains one oxygen as a hydroxyl group
- Is similar in size to some of the smallest examples
- Has a simple structure without complex features

Comparing specifically to similar molecules in the training set:
- CCC (0.69923148)
- CCCCOC=O (0.13935232)
- CCC(C)CO (0.17267971)
- Simple alcohols tend to be lower than their hydrocarbon counterparts

Based on these patterns and considering methanol's small size and alcohol functionality, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.21

This takes into account its small size (which tends to give positive values in the training set) but adjusts downward for the presence of the hydroxyl group.
