True Property: 54.62600000000005
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester with a long alkyl chain (10 carbons in the main chain).

Looking at similar structures in the examples:
- CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (12 carbons) has a value of 63.86
- Simpler esters like CCOC(=O)CC have lower values (26.924)
- The property value tends to increase with molecular size and chain length
- Esters generally show moderate to high values

Given that our target molecule has:
- A methyl ester group (similar to examples)

- Simpler aromatics like CCCc1ccccc1 have lower values (40.437)
- The complexity and size of the molecule tends to correlate with higher values

Given that fluorene:

- But more complex than simple aromatics (~40)
- Has a similar ring system to other fused aromatics
- Contains no functional groups

I would predict a property value of approximately 52.4

This prediction takes into account that the property value should be:
- Higher than simple aromatics
- Lower than larger PAHs
- Consistent with the general trend seen in the training data for similar structures

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 37.5808
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethylphenol (two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a benzene ring).

Looking at the patterns in the examples:
1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values in the 30-45 range
2. Phenol (c1ccccc1O) has a value of 28.1068
3. Methylated aromatics like toluene derivatives typically increase the value by 5-10 units per methyl group

- Simple phenol: 28.1068
- Methylated aromatics like Cc1cccc(C)c1 (xylene-type): ~40-45
- The target molecule has two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group

Given these patterns and considering the structural features, I predict the property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 to be approximately:

37.4

This prediction takes into account:
- The base aromatic structure
- The contribution of two methyl groups
- The hydroxyl group contribution
- The relative positions of the substituents

True Property: 71.89100000000003
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict the property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S))
- Two methoxy groups (OC) attached to phosphorus
- A phenyl ring with methyl (C) and methylthio (SC) substituents
- An oxygen bridge connecting the phosphorothioate to the aromatic ring

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has a value of 73.093
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has a value of 78.11
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a value of 70.403

The target molecule has a similar phosphorothioate core structure but with different substituents (SC and C instead of Cl). The methylthio (SC) group is less electronegative than Cl, and the molecule has fewer halogen substituents overall, which should result in a somewhat lower value.

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 to be approximately 65.8.

- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (86.948)

The target molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than the second reference (5 vs 7)
- Same number of chlorines as the first reference (5)
- Similar biaryl core structure
- Slightly different chlorine positioning

Based on these structural comparisons and the observed property values in the training set, I would predict the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl to be approximately:

78.4

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has slightly lower molecular weight and fewer substituents than some of the similar reference compounds, but maintains the key structural features that contribute to the property value.

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. It has a short carbon chain (3 carbons)
3. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - Simple alkanes (CCC) have low values (~16)
   - Adding oxygen-containing groups increases the value
   - Nitro groups tend to increase the value moderately
   - Similar sized molecules with oxygen functionalities are in the 25-35 range

Considering these factors:
- Base value for propyl chain: ~16-20
- Addition of N(=O)=O group: +10-15 based on similar functional group contributions
- Size and complexity adjustment: minimal

Therefore, I predict the property value to be approximately 28.5

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is relatively simple but contains a polar nitro group, placing it in between simple alkanes and more complex oxygenated molecules in the training set.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 34.1
Predicted Property:

- Bicyclic structures tend to increase the value
- The presence of OH groups typically adds 5-10 units
- Each ring system typically contributes 15-20 units
- Methyl substituents each add 2-4 units

Given these considerations and the molecule's complexity level being between simple alcohols and more complex bicyclic structures, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

44.3

This prediction takes into account:
- Base bicyclic structure (~30)
- OH group contribution (~7)
- Multiple methyl groups (~7)

2. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S)
3. Has a phthalimide ring system
4. Contains ethoxy groups (OCC)
5. The main difference from the similar compound is the absence of the CCl group and the direct P-N bond instead of P-S-C linkage

Given these observations:
- The base value would be similar to the reference compound (96.578)
- The missing CCl group and simpler linkage would reduce the value
- The overall molecular size is smaller
- The structural complexity is slightly lower

Based on these factors and the patterns observed in the training set, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

True Property: 40.775000000000006
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule (CCCCCC(=O)OCC) and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

The molecule is an ester with:
- A straight chain of 6 carbons on one side (hexanoyl group)
- An ethyl group on the other side of the ester linkage
- Total of 8 carbons
- One ester functional group (C(=O)O)

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Simple esters tend to have values in the 20-50 range
- CCOC(=O)N has a value of 21.2094
- COC=O (simplest ester) has a value of 13.073
- Longer chain esters like CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC has a value of 50.009

The target molecule is shorter than the C9 ester (50.009) but longer than the simple esters (13-21 range). The presence of the longer alkyl chain will increase the value compared to simple esters, but not as much as the C9 ester.

Based on these patterns and considering the molecular size and functionality, I predict the property value to be approximately:

35.4

This prediction takes into account both the ester functionality and the chain length effects observed in the training set.

The target molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate) is very similar to ethyl benzoate, just with a methyl ester instead of an ethyl ester. Since removing a CH2 group typically decreases the property value slightly, and considering the systematic patterns in the dataset, I would predict:

Predicted value: 39.8

This prediction is based on:
1. Its high similarity to ethyl benzoate (42.3985)
2. The slightly smaller size due to methyl vs ethyl group
3. The general trends observed in the dataset for similar aromatic esters

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 25.10499999999999
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice this is likely predicting some physical property of molecules. The query molecule CC/C=C\C is a cis-2-pentene, which is very similar to CC/C=C/C (trans-2-pentene) that has a value of 25.105 in the training set.

The only difference between these molecules is the stereochemistry of the double bond (cis vs trans). Generally, cis alkenes have slightly different physical properties than their trans counterparts, often with small but noticeable differences.

Given that the trans isomer has a value of 25.105, and considering that cis isomers typically have slightly different values (often slightly higher) for many physical properties, I would predict the value for CC/C=C\C to be approximately:

The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is isopropylbenzene (cumene) with an additional methylene (-CH2-) group between the isopropyl group and the benzene ring.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethyltoluene) has a value of 40.557
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (p-cymene) has a value of 45.268

2. It's similar to some of the other chlorinated aromatic compounds in the training set
3. The structure is relatively large and complex
4. It has a similar pattern to "Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" (which has a value of 101.978) but with fewer chlorine atoms

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data:
- Larger molecules tend to have higher values
- Chlorinated aromatics contribute significantly to the property
- Biphenyl structures tend to increase the value
- Each chlorine atom appears to contribute incrementally

Considering all these factors, and noting that this molecule has fewer chlorines than the similar reference compound (which had 101.978), I would predict the property value to be approximately:

87.5

This prediction takes into account the molecule's size, aromaticity, number of chlorine substituents, and structural similarity to known compounds in the training set.

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) by comparing it to the given examples and looking for structural similarities and patterns.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Small molecules generally have lower values
2. Halogenated compounds show moderate values
3. The most similar molecule in the training set is "ClCCCl" with a value of 21.44

ClCCl is smaller than ClCCCl by one carbon, and generally, in this dataset, smaller molecules tend to have slightly lower values. However, the presence of two chlorine atoms will contribute significantly to the property.

Analyzing the patterns and considering:
- The molecule's small size
- The presence of two chlorine atoms
- Direct comparison with ClCCCl (21.44)
- The general trend that smaller halogenated compounds have values in the 15-25 range

I predict the property value for ClCCl to be approximately 19.2

This prediction takes into account that it should be slightly lower than ClCCCl (21.44) due to having one less carbon, while still maintaining a moderate value due to the two chlorine atoms.

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: 37.5808
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The molecule "Cc1cccc(C)c1O" is a dimethylphenol (specifically, a dimethyl-substituted phenol with two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a benzene ring).

Looking at similar structures from the training examples:
- Oc1cccc(O)c1 (dihydroxybenzene) has a value of 29.7716
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (a methylated phenol) has a value of 46.9328
- Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (a substituted phenol) has a value of 34.7612

The target molecule has:
1. A hydroxyl group like all these references
2. Two methyl groups, which generally increase the value
3. Structure complexity between simple phenol and more complex substituted phenols

Considering these factors and the patterns in the training data, where:
- Additional methyl groups tend to increase the value
- The base phenol structure typically gives values in the 30-50 range
- Similar substitution patterns show values in the 40s

I predict the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O to be approximately 42.3

This prediction takes into account that it's more complex than simple phenol but less complex than some of the larger substituted examples, and considers the contribution of the two methyl groups to the overall property value.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 71.91800000000002
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl has several key structural features:
1. It's a biaryl system (two benzene rings connected)
2. Contains 4 chlorine atoms
3. Has similar structural elements to some molecules in the training set

Looking at similar molecules from the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (81.938) - very similar structure but with 6 Cl atoms
- Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (76.928) - similar biaryl core with 5 Cl atoms

The target molecule has fewer chlorine atoms than these reference molecules but maintains the biaryl core structure. The property appears to increase with:
- Number of aromatic rings
- Number of halogens
- Overall molecular size

Based on these patterns and considering that our molecule has 4 chlorines (fewer than the reference molecules) but maintains the biaryl system, I would predict a property value of approximately:

77.2

This prediction takes into account that the value should be slightly lower than the 6-chlorine analog (81.938) but still relatively high due to the biaryl system and four chlorine substituents.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 25.10499999999999
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecular structure and the given examples, I'll predict the property value for CC=C(C)C (2-methylbut-2-ene).

Looking at the patterns in the training examples, I notice that:
1. Smaller, simpler molecules generally have lower values (20-40 range)
2. Alkenes tend to have slightly higher values than their alkane counterparts
3. Branching tends to increase the value slightly
4. The molecule in question is a small, branched alkene with 5 carbons

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- Simple alkenes like COC(=O)C=C have values around 22
- Larger straight-chain alkenes like CCCCCCCCC=C are around 48
- Branched alkanes like CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C are around 43
- Small aromatics like Cc1ccccc1O are around 33

Given that this molecule (CC=C(C)C) is:
- A small molecule (which suggests lower value)
- Contains a double bond (slight increase)
- Has branching (slight increase)
- Has 5 carbons total

I would predict a property value of approximately 27.4

This takes into account its small size while factoring in the slight increases expected from the double bond and branching patterns observed in the training set.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with the following key features:
1. A phenol core structure (hydroxyl group on benzene)
2. Three chlorine substituents
3. Similar to Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl in the training set (which has a value of 43.1368)

Looking at similar structures and patterns in the training data:

42.8

This prediction takes into account the slight difference in chlorine positioning while maintaining the essential structural features that influence the property value.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 138.34539999999996
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this complex molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the patterns from the examples, I observe that:
1. Larger molecules generally have higher values
2. Complex ring systems increase the value
3. Presence of oxygen-containing groups (ethers, esters) contributes significantly
4. Sugar-like moieties (cyclic ethers with OH groups) add substantial value
5. Aromatic rings with substituents increase the value
6. The presence of multiple fused rings tends to give higher values

The target molecule contains:
- Multiple aromatic rings
- Several ether linkages
- A lactone group
- A sugar-like moiety
- Multiple oxygen-containing substituents
- Complex fused ring systems
- Methylenedioxy group

Comparing to similar complex structures in the training set, particularly those with sugar moieties and multiple ring systems (like the steroid derivatives ~90-95, and complex heterocycles ~80-85), and considering this molecule is even more complex, I would predict a property value of approximately:

108.4

This prediction takes into account the molecule's size, complexity, and the presence of multiple functional groups that tend to increase the property value based on the patterns observed in the training set.

2. Has a thioether (CSc-) group
3. Contains a carbonyl group
4. Has a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)
5. Has an amino substituent (-N)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a value of 65.1208
- Other heterocyclic compounds with similar size are typically in the 55-70 range
- The presence of the thioether and tert-butyl groups suggests a moderate increase in the property value

Considering these factors and the overall molecular complexity, I would predict the property value to be approximately 61.4

This prediction takes into account:
- The similar heterocyclic nature to known compounds
- The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms
- The contribution of the thioether group
- The tert-butyl substituent
- The overall molecular size and complexity

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 42.39850000000003
Predicted Property:

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate, which contains:
- A benzene ring (c1ccccc1)
- An ester group (C(=O)OC)
- An ethyl group (CC)

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple molecules with just carbon chains have lower values (CC = 11.348)
2. Benzene-containing molecules typically have moderate values (Nc1ccccc1 = 30.8544)
3. When functional groups like esters are added to benzene rings, the values increase
4. The complexity and size of the molecule generally correlates with higher values
5. Similar structures like CCCC(=O)OC (36.158) and CCCCC(=O)OCC (36.158) provide good reference points

Given that this molecule is:
- More complex than simple benzene derivatives
- Contains an ester group
- Has similar size and functionality to some reference compounds
- Is less complex than the larger molecules in the dataset

I predict the property value to be approximately 42.5

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is more complex than simple aromatics but less complex than the larger molecules in the dataset, and considers the contribution of both the aromatic ring and the ester functionality.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 42.55300000000001
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

CCCCCCCBr is a 1-bromoheptane, a straight-chain alkyl bromide.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple linear molecules tend to have lower values (20-40 range)
2. Halogens typically increase the value somewhat
3. Longer carbon chains tend to increase the value gradually
4. The most similar molecules in the training set are:
   - CCCCCCC=C (38.956)
   - CCCCCCCO (35.8448)
   - Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (51.648, though this is aromatic)

Given that:
- It's a linear molecule (suggesting lower base value)
- Has 7 carbons (similar to some examples)
- Contains a bromine (which typically adds some value)
- Is structurally most similar to CCCCCCC=C but with Br instead of C=C

I would predict a value of approximately 41.2 for CCCCCCCBr.

This prediction takes into account that bromine typically contributes slightly more to the property than a terminal double bond, but the overall molecular structure remains similar to the linear molecules in the training set.

Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 8.1428
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CO (methanol) is one of the simplest organic molecules containing a carbon atom bonded to a hydroxyl group.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Small, simple molecules tend to have lower values (e.g., CCC at 15.965, CC#C at 14.507)
2. Addition of oxygen typically increases the value slightly compared to pure hydrocarbons
3. Molecules with similar size and functional groups like CCC(C)CO (26.5408) and CCCCOC=O (26.924) can serve as reference points
4. The presence of a single oxygen generally adds a few units to the base value

Given that CO is:
- Very small (smaller than most training examples)
- Has one oxygen
- Is simpler than methyl groups with oxygen
- Would be expected to have a value between the smallest examples and simple alcohols

I predict the property value for CO (methanol) to be approximately 13.2

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Higher than the smallest molecules in the set
- Lower than larger alcohols and oxygenated compounds
- Proportional to its molecular complexity
