SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.9090909090909091
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester with a long alkyl chain (10 carbons in the main chain).

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (12 carbons) has a value of 0.9230769230769231
- Other long-chain aliphatic compounds like CCCCCC, CCCCCCC(C)O have values close to 1.0
- Esters generally show high values (>0.8) in the training set
- The presence of the ester group slightly reduces the value compared to pure alkanes

Given that this molecule:
1. Has a similar structure to CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC but with 2 fewer carbons
2. Contains an ester group
3. Has a long aliphatic chain

I would predict a property value of approximately 0.9090909090909091

This prediction takes into account that:
- It should be slightly lower than 1.0 due to the ester group
- It should be very close to the value of the 12-carbon analog in the training set
- The shorter chain length compared to the 12-carbon analog would make only a minor difference

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:

1. It's a bicyclic structure containing a benzoxazinone core
2. Contains a chlorine substituent
3. Has oxygen and nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring system
4. Contains a carbonyl group (C=O)
5. Has an NH group

Analyzing patterns from the training data:
- Molecules with chlorine substituents generally have lower values (often close to 0-0.3)
- Heterocyclic compounds with oxygen and nitrogen tend to have lower values
- Fused ring systems typically show lower values
- Presence of NH and C=O groups in cyclic systems also correlates with lower values

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately:

0.14285714285714285

This prediction takes into account the structural similarities with other chlorinated aromatic compounds and heterocyclic systems in the training set, particularly those containing oxygen and nitrogen in their ring systems.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite.

Looking at the patterns from the examples:
1. Simple aliphatic molecules with few carbons and halogens tend to have values close to 1.0
2. Aromatic and complex ring systems tend to have values close to 0.0
3. Molecules with intermediate complexity or mixed features tend to have values between 0.2-0.7
4. Presence of N=O groups appears in a few examples with values around 0.5

For this specific molecule:
- It's relatively simple (not aromatic)
- Has a branched aliphatic structure
- Contains a nitrite group (N=O)
- Similar in complexity to some examples with mid-range values
- Most similar to examples like Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO which has a value of 0.5

Based on these observations, I predict the property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O to be approximately:

0.5

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 0.8095238095238095
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns from the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, I notice:

1. It's a complex steroid-like structure (similar to some of the training examples)
2. Contains oxygen atoms in different functional groups (hydroxyl -OH and ketone C=O)
3. Has multiple ring systems
4. Contains mostly sp3 carbons
5. Has some polar functional groups

Looking at the training examples:
- Molecules with multiple ring systems tend to have lower values
- However, molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups (especially ketones and alcohols) tend to have higher values
- The most similar example in the training set is CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C which had a value of 0.8095238095238095

Given the structural similarity to the steroid example in the training set, and considering the presence of both ketone and hydroxyl groups, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.78

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has slightly more polar groups than the similar training example but maintains the same core structure.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns I observe in the training examples.

Key observations from the examples:
1. Simple linear alkanes and alcohols tend to have values close to 1.0
2. Molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have lower values (0.0-0.25)
3. Molecules with halogens (Cl, F, Br) on aromatic rings often have values close to 0
4. Molecules with urea linkages (-NC(=O)N-) tend to have intermediate values (0.3-0.7)
5. Complex structures with multiple functional groups tend to have lower values than simple structures

The target molecule has:
- Two aromatic rings
- Two fluorine atoms on one ring
- One chlorine atom on the other ring
- A urea linkage (-NC(=O)NC(=O)-)
- Overall complex structure

Based on these features and comparing to similar structures in the training set, particularly those with:
- Multiple halogens on aromatic rings
- Urea-like functionalities
- Similar complexity level

I would predict a property value of approximately 0.25

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The presence of halogens on aromatic rings typically reduces the value
2. The urea linkage typically gives intermediate values
3. The overall complexity and presence of multiple aromatic rings tends to lower the value
==================================================
Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule CCCOC(C)C and comparing it with the training examples, I notice:

1. It's an aliphatic molecule (no aromatic rings)
2. Contains an ether linkage (O)
3. Has branching with methyl groups
4. Similar in structure to molecules like CCOC(=O)CC (0.8) and CC1CCCO1 (1.0)
5. Contains only C, H, and O atoms
6. Is relatively small and simple
7. Has similar structural features to other aliphatic ethers and alcohols in the training set which tend to have high values (most are close to 1.0)

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- Simple aliphatic molecules generally have values close to 1.0
- Molecules with oxygen in aliphatic chains typically maintain high values
- Branched aliphatic compounds also show high values

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict the property value for CCCOC(C)C to be approximately:

0.9

This prediction takes into account that while it's similar to molecules that score 1.0, the presence of the ether linkage and branching might slightly reduce the value, but not significantly.
==================================================
Iteration: 7
SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.5555555555555556
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The target molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O has:
- A uracil-like ring structure (pyrimidine-2,4-dione)
- Bromine substitution
- Ethyl and methyl branching
- Multiple polar groups (C=O)

Looking at patterns from the training examples:
1. Molecules with bromine often have lower values (e.g., CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 has 0.125)
2. Molecules with heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen tend to have lower to medium values
3. The presence of polar groups (C=O) typically reduces the value
4. Small alkyl substitutions (ethyl, methyl) slightly increase the value
5. The overall complexity and mix of polar/non-polar regions suggests a moderate-low value

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.25

This takes into account the moderating effect of the bromine, the heterocyclic structure, and the balance between the polar groups and alkyl substituents.
==================================================
Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The molecule "c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2" is biphenyl, consisting of two benzene rings connected by a single bond.

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Molecules with high aromaticity and conjugated ring systems tend to have lower values (closer to 0)
2. Simple aliphatic molecules tend to have values closer to 1
3. Molecules with similar biphenyl-like structures in the training set have values around 0.1-0.4
4. The presence of fused aromatic rings generally leads to lower values

Given that this molecule:
- Is fully aromatic
- Has two connected benzene rings
- Is similar to some of the simpler aromatic structures in the training set
- Has no additional functional groups

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value for biphenyl to be:

0.2

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is more complex than a single benzene ring but simpler than the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that show values closer to 0 in the training set.
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule (CCCCS) and compare it with the patterns I observe in the training examples:

1) Looking at the molecule CCCCS (butanethiol):
- It's a linear aliphatic molecule
- Contains only single bonds
- Has a sulfur atom at the end
- Similar in structure to simple alkanes/thiols

2) Analyzing patterns from the training data:
- Simple linear alkanes (like CCCCCC(C)C) tend to have values of 1.0
- Molecules with only C, H, and one heteroatom often have higher values
- Simpler structures generally have higher values than complex aromatics
- Aliphatic chains with single heteroatoms usually have values between 0.6-1.0

3) Most relevant similar examples from training set:
- CCCCCCCC=C (0.7777...)
- CCCCCC(C)C (1.0)
- CCCC(C)(C)C (1.0)
- Simple aliphatic molecules with one functional group typically score high

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to other aliphatic molecules in the training set, while accounting for the presence of the sulfur atom, I would predict a property value of:

0.8

This prediction takes into account that while the molecule is similar to alkanes (which score 1.0), the presence of the sulfur atom likely reduces the value slightly, similar to how other heteroatom-containing aliphatics score slightly lower than pure alkanes in the training set.
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns I observe in the training examples.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with:
- A main chain of 4 carbons (butyl)
- Two methyl groups branching from one carbon
- A hydroxyl (OH) group

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCCC(C)(O)CC (branched alcohol) has value 1.0
- CC(C)CC(C)O (branched alcohol) has value 1.0
- CCCCOC (linear ether) has value 1.0
- CCC(C)(C)C (branched alkane) has value 1.0

I notice that:
1. Molecules with similar branched aliphatic structures tend to have high values
2. Alcohols in aliphatic chains consistently show high values
3. The presence of branching methyl groups appears to contribute to higher values
4. Simple aliphatic structures without aromatics or multiple heteroatoms tend toward values of 1.0

Based on these patterns and the structural similarity to several examples with value 1.0, I predict that CCCC(C)(C)CO would have a property value of:

1.0

Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.09090909090909091
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is methylnaphthalene, which consists of:
- A naphthalene core (two fused benzene rings)
- One methyl (CH3) substituent

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (more complex fused ring) = 0.0667
- Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (dimethylnaphthalene) = 0.1667
- c1ccccc1 (benzene, simpler aromatic) = 0.0

The target molecule is most similar to these examples, particularly to dimethylnaphthalene, but has one less methyl group. The pattern suggests that:
1. Fused aromatic systems tend to have lower values
2. Adding methyl groups slightly increases the value
3. The structure is most similar to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 but should have a slightly lower value due to having one less methyl group

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 to be approximately:

0.125

This value reflects that it's a methylated naphthalene system, placing it between the values seen for similar structures in the training set.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 0.5833333333333334
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The given molecule is a barbituric acid derivative with an alkyl substituent. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a value of 0.375
2. The new molecule differs by having a longer alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) instead of just (C)

Key observations:
- The core structure (barbituric acid) is identical to example #1
- The main difference is a longer alkyl substituent
- Generally, molecules with longer alkyl chains tend to have slightly higher values in the training set
- However, the presence of the cyclic structure and multiple carbonyl groups tends to lower the value

Considering these factors:
- The base value would be similar to the similar structure (0.375)
- The longer alkyl chain would increase the value slightly
- The overall structural similarity to the known example is very high

Based on these considerations, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.4 for O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.14285714285714285
Predicted Property:

Looking at the examples, I notice several patterns:
1. Molecules with high values (close to 1.0) tend to be:
   - Simple alcohols
   - Simple alkanes
   - Simple sulfur compounds
   - Molecules with fewer aromatic rings

2. Molecules with low values (close to 0.0) tend to be:
   - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   - Heavily halogenated compounds
   - Complex fused ring systems

The molecule in question, FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, is trifluoromethylbenzene. It has:
- A single benzene ring
- Three fluorine atoms
- A relatively simple structure compared to the lowest-scoring examples
- Some similarity to halogenated aromatics in the training set

Based on these observations, and particularly noting that halogenated aromatics tend to have low values but simple structures tend to have higher values, I would predict a value of:

0.2

This prediction takes into account that it's more complex than simple molecules that score 1.0, but less complex than the polycyclic or heavily substituted molecules that score near 0.0. The presence of the CF3 group and single aromatic ring suggests a relatively low but non-zero value.

   - Highly oxygenated molecules generally have higher values

Based on these observations and the similarity to other sugar-like molecules in the training set, I would predict the property value to be:

1.0

This prediction is based primarily on the structural similarity to other highly hydroxylated molecules in the training set and the consistent pattern of such molecules having values at or very close to 1.0.

3. Similar steroid-like structures in the training set (like CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O) have values around 0.67

Given that this molecule:

2. It has an acetamide group (CC(=O)N-)
3. It's an aromatic system with para-substitution
4. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
   - Molecules with nitro groups tend to have low values (0.0-0.3)

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, particularly:
- O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (0.0)
- COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (0.14285714285714285)

I would predict a value of approximately 0.125 for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O.

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has similar structural features to examples with low values, but the presence of the acetamide group might slightly increase the value compared to simpler nitrobenzene derivatives.

For the target molecule "CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12":
- It contains both aliphatic portions (CCOP, OCC)

- Compounds with multiple phenyl rings typically have values below 0.3
- The presence of urea-like structures (N-C(=O)-N) appears in some examples with moderate to low values

Based on these patterns and the structural features, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.2

This prediction takes into account the molecule's aromatic nature, the presence of the urea linkage, and its similarity to other compounds in the training set with comparable structural features.

2. Has multiple nitrogen atoms including primary amines (-NH2)
3. Contains a para-substituted benzene ring
4. Has a guanidine-like structure (-NC(=N)N-)
5. Overall, it's a relatively polar molecule with multiple hydrogen bond donors and acceptors

Looking at patterns in the training data:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have lower values (0.0-0.3)
- Simple aliphatic molecules tend to have higher values (close to 1.0)
- Molecules with mixed aromatic and polar functional groups often have intermediate values (0.3-0.6)
- Presence of multiple heteroatoms (N, O, S) tends to give intermediate values

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to other molecules in the training set containing aromatic rings with polar substituents, I would predict a property value of:

0.3333333333333333

This prediction takes into account the molecule's aromatic nature balanced with its polar functional groups and multiple nitrogen atoms.

True Property: 0.38461538461538464
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, I notice:

2. It has a trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)
3. It has an alkyl amine structure (CCN)
4. It contains an alkene group (C=C)

- Highly fluorinated compounds tend to have moderate values
- Molecules with both aromatic and aliphatic portions tend to have moderate values
- Complex substituted aromatics generally show values in the 0.2-0.4 range
- The presence of nitrogen-containing groups often leads to moderate values

Based on these observations and the structural similarities with other molecules in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.33

This prediction takes into account the competing effects of the electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and trifluoromethyl) and the electron-donating amine portion, as well as the overall molecular complexity.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.75
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it to the patterns in the training examples.

CC(C)OC=O is a formate ester with a branched structure (isopropyl formate).

Looking at the patterns in the training set:
1. Molecules with C=O (carbonyl) groups typically have values between 0.75-0.85
2. Simple esters (with OC=O group) like CC(C)CCOC=O have values around 0.83
3. Short-chain molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have relatively high values
4. The presence of branching (CC(C)-) doesn't seem to significantly affect the property
5. Similar structures like CC(C)CCOC=O has a value of 0.8333333333333334

Given these observations, and considering that this molecule is:
- A simple ester
- Has a branched structure
- Contains a carbonyl group
- Is relatively small
- Very similar to CC(C)CCOC=O but shorter

I predict the property value would be approximately 0.8333333333333334

This prediction is based on the strong similarity to CC(C)CCOC=O in the training set, and the consistent patterns seen for similar ester-containing molecules.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 0.25
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a benzene ring with:
- Two methyl groups (C)
- One hydroxyl group (O)

Looking at patterns from the training examples:
1. Simple aromatic compounds with hydroxyl groups tend to have low values (like c1ccccc1O at 0.0)
2. Molecules with methyl substituents on benzene rings tend to have values around 0.14-0.33 (like Cc1cccc(N)c1 at 0.14285714285714285)
3. The presence of hydroxyl groups with alkyl substituents on benzene rings (like in Oc2ccc1CCCCc1c2 at 0.4) suggests moderate values

Given these patterns and considering:
- The molecule's relatively simple structure
- The presence of both methyl groups and a hydroxyl group
- The similarity to other substituted aromatic compounds in the training set

I would predict a property value of approximately 0.25 for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1.

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is more substituted than simple phenol (which has 0.0) but less complex than many of the higher-valued molecules in the training set.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.4
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, I notice:

1. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)) similar to several examples like COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl which has a value of 0.25

2. The basic structure is similar to other phosphorothioate compounds in the training set, particularly those with:
- COP(=S)(OC)O- core structure
- Aromatic ring substitution
- Similar molecular size and complexity

3. The main differences are:
- It has SC (methylthio) and C (methyl) substituents instead of halogens
- The substitution pattern is different

Looking at the most similar compounds in the training set:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl = 0.25
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl = 0.25
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl = 0.25

Given that all similar phosphorothioate compounds in the training set have a consistent value of 0.25, and the modifications in our target molecule are not drastically different in terms of electronic and steric effects, I would predict:

Predicted value: 0.25

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns I observe in the training examples.

Key observations from the given molecule "Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl":
1. It's a highly chlorinated biphenyl structure
2. Contains multiple chlorine substituents
3. Has two connected aromatic rings
4. No aliphatic chains
5. No other functional groups besides chlorine substituents

Looking at similar molecules from the training set:
- "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" (highly chlorinated biphenyl) has value 0.0
- "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" (similar chlorinated biphenyl) has value 0.0
- Other highly halogenated aromatic compounds generally have values close to 0.0

Based on these patterns, especially the structural similarity to other chlorinated biphenyls in the training set which consistently show a value of 0.0, I predict that the property value for "Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl" would be:

0.0

This prediction is made with high confidence due to the strong structural similarities with other chlorinated biphenyl compounds in the training set that consistently show this value.

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O, which is propyl nitrite) by comparing it with the patterns I observe in the training examples:

1. The molecule contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O), which generally seems to lower the property value in the examples
2. It has a short carbon chain (CCC), and short straight-chain alkanes tend to have high values (like CCC = 1.0)
3. Looking at similar molecules with N(=O)=O groups in the training set, they generally have lower values
4. The molecule is relatively small and simple
5. Comparing with other molecules containing both aliphatic chains and nitrogen-oxygen functional groups in the training set, they tend to have moderate values

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.6 for CCCN(=O)=O.

This prediction takes into account that:
- The presence of the nitro group will reduce the value from 1.0 (which we see for pure alkanes)
- The short carbon chain provides some positive contribution
- The molecule is simpler than many of the complex aromatic examples that have very low values
==================================================
Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1

- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (similar disubstituted pattern) through COc1cccc(Cl)c1 has a value of ~0.14
- Other halogenated aromatics generally show low values

Key observations:
1. Halogenated benzenes consistently show low property values
2. The pattern is very similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 which has a value of 0.0
3. Meta-substitution pattern (as in the target molecule) vs para-substitution doesn't seem to make a major difference in the training examples

Based on these patterns, and particularly the strong similarity to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, I would predict the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 to be:

0.0

This prediction is based on the structural similarity to other dihalogenated benzenes in the training set, particularly those containing bromine, which consistently show very low values.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:

1. It's a bicyclic structure
2. Contains an alcohol (OH) group
3. Has multiple methyl substituents
4. Contains only C, H, and O atoms
5. Has a relatively compact, saturated ring system

Looking at patterns from the training examples:
- Molecules with OH groups often have high values (like CCCC(C)(C)O: 1.0)
- Simple alcohols generally score high
- Cyclic structures tend to reduce the value somewhat
- Complex ring systems generally lower the value
- Presence of only C, H, O (without halogens or other heteroatoms) tends to give higher values

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, particularly considering:
- Its similarity to steroidal frameworks (which score around 0.7-0.8)
- The presence of the OH group (which typically increases the value)
- The relatively simple nature of the molecule compared to more complex examples

I would predict a property value of approximately 0.8 for this molecule.

- A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
- An imide ring system
- A benzene ring fused to the imide
- Ethoxy groups attached to the phosphorus

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O has a value of 0.42857142857142855, and is very similar to our target molecule
- Other molecules containing imide rings (like O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1) tend to have values around 0.5-0.6
- Molecules with P=S groups tend to have moderate values
- The presence of aromatic rings typically reduces the value somewhat

Given these observations and the very close structural similarity to the first example mentioned (just missing the SC(CCl) portion), I would predict a value of approximately:

0.45

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly simpler than the closest analog in the training set but maintains most of the key structural features that appear to influence the property value.

3. The presence of carbonyl groups in heterocyclic systems often leads to values in the 0.1-0.3 range
4. Similar molecules like "O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23" have very low values (0.077)

Based on these observations and the structural similarities with several training examples, I predict the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C to be approximately:

0.15

This prediction takes into account the molecule's similarity to other heterocyclic compounds in the training set and the presence of similar structural features that tend to result in lower property values.

The molecule CCCCCC(=O)OCC is an ester with:
- A straight chain of 6 carbons on one side of the ester group
- An ethyl group on the other side of the ester group
- Contains a C=O group (carbonyl)
- Has an oxygen linkage

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Simple esters tend to have high values (like COC=O with 0.5)
- Longer chain esters tend to have higher values (like CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC with 0.9)
- Molecules with straight alkyl chains generally have values close to 1.0
- The presence of ester group slightly reduces the value compared to pure alkanes

Given that this molecule:
- Is relatively simple
- Has a straight alkyl chain
- Contains an ester group
- Is similar in structure to other esters in the training set
- Has intermediate chain length

I predict the property value would be approximately 0.8

This prediction takes into account that it's more complex than simple esters (0.5) but less complex than very long chain esters (0.9), and considers the general trend that simpler, more alkane-like molecules tend to have higher values.

- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 has a value of 0.2222222222222222
- Other aromatic esters show values around 0.2-0.3

The query molecule is very similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, with the only difference being a methyl ester (COC(=O)-) instead of an ethyl ester (CCOC(=O)-). Given this close structural similarity and the consistent pattern seen in similar aromatic esters in the training set, I would predict the property value to be:

0.2222222222222222

This prediction is based on the strong structural similarity to the training examples and the apparent consistency of this property value for aromatic ester compounds in the dataset.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.2
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The molecule C=CCC=C (1,4-pentadiene) has these key characteristics:
- It's a small hydrocarbon
- Contains two double bonds
- Linear structure
- No cyclic components
- No heteroatoms
- Simple aliphatic structure

Looking at similar molecules from the training set:
- CC/C=C/C (2-pentene) has a value of 0.6
- C=Cc1ccccc1 (styrene) has a value of 0.0, but this one has an aromatic ring
- Simple hydrocarbons like CCC(C)(C)CC have higher values (1.0)
- Other simple molecules with double bonds tend to have moderate to high values

Given that:
1. It's structurally similar to 2-pentene (CC/C=C/C) which has a value of 0.6
2. It has an additional double bond which might reduce the value slightly
3. It maintains the simple aliphatic nature which generally corresponds to higher values
4. It lacks any complex substituents or aromatic groups

I would predict a property value of approximately 0.5 for C=CCC=C.

This prediction takes into account both its similarity to known examples and its structural features.
==================================================
Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing patterns, I notice several key trends:

1. Molecules with high halogen content (especially Br, Cl) and aromatic systems tend to have values closer to 0.0

2. Simple aliphatic molecules, especially those with oxygen-containing functional groups like alcohols, tend to have values closer to 1.0

3. Molecules with multiple halogens on a single carbon often have values closer to 1.0 (like FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br which has a value of 1.0)

For the molecule BrC(Br)Br (tribromomethane or bromoform):
- It's a simple aliphatic molecule
- It has three bromine atoms on a single carbon
- Its structure is similar to other trihalomethanes in the dataset
- It doesn't contain any aromatic systems

Based on these observations and particularly considering the similarity to other halogenated methanes in the training set, I would predict:

- Other chlorinated compounds with complex ring systems typically have values between 0.1-0.5

Based on these patterns and similarities, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.4 for this molecule. This takes into account the structural complexity, presence of chlorine, phosphorothioate group, and the balance between aliphatic and aromatic portions.

My prediction: 0.4

True Property: 0.4
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict the property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice several patterns:
1. Molecules with many aromatic rings and complex structures tend to have lower values (closer to 0)
2. Simple aliphatic molecules tend to have higher values (closer to 1)
3. The presence of certain functional groups like amides (C(=O)N) tends to give intermediate values
4. Molecules with multiple heteroatoms and fused ring systems generally have lower values
5. The presence of halogens (Cl) often reduces the value

The target molecule has:
- Multiple aromatic rings
- A chlorine substituent

Considering these features and comparing to similar structures in the training set, particularly other molecules with:
- Amide functionalities (like CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C with 0.8)
- Complex aromatic systems (which typically have lower values)
- Chlorine substituents (which tend to lower the value)

I would predict a property value of approximately 0.25 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has some features that would increase the value (amide, tert-butyl group) but also many features that would decrease it (complex ring system, multiple heteroatoms, chlorine).

- Molecules with similar di-aryl structures also tend to have low values
  - Example: c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2 -> 0.0
  - Example: Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 -> 0.0

Based on these patterns, especially the presence of multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings and the di-aryl structure, I predict the property value to be:

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.6
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. The molecule "CC/C=C/C" (trans-2-pentene) has a value of 0.6
2. The query molecule "CC/C=C\C" (cis-2-pentene) is its geometric isomer
3. The examples show that molecules with similar structures tend to have similar values
4. The stereochemistry (cis/trans) doesn't seem to make a significant difference in the property values across the dataset

Given that:
- The molecules are identical except for the stereochemistry around the double bond
- The trans isomer (CC/C=C/C) has a value of 0.6
- Stereochemistry generally doesn't appear to dramatically affect the property in the training set

I would predict that the cis-2-pentene (CC/C=C\C) would have the same or very similar value to its trans isomer.

Therefore, my prediction for CC/C=C\C is: 0.6

- Similar simple ethers in the training set tend to have high values

Comparing with similar structures and patterns from the training data, and considering the structural simplicity and presence of just one oxygen atom, I would predict the property value for CCCOCC to be:

0.8

This prediction is based on:
1. The molecule's similarity to simple aliphatic structures which typically show high values
2. The presence of a single oxygen which might slightly reduce the value from 1.0
3. The absence of any complex structural features that tend to lower the property value
4. The linear nature of the molecule which generally correlates with higher values in the training set

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.5

3. Small cyclic molecules with oxygen-containing groups tend to have intermediate to high values
4. The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) in cyclic structures often leads to intermediate values

The target molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 has these characteristics:
- Contains a cyclic structure
- Multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)
- Contains nitrogen atoms
- Has a small cyclopropane ring fused to a larger heterocyclic ring
- No aromatic systems
- Relatively compact structure

Based on these characteristics and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

==================================================
Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and the patterns in the training examples to make a prediction.

The molecule ClCC (chloroethane) has the following characteristics:
- It's a very small molecule
- Contains a chlorine atom
- Has a short carbon chain
- Similar to some simple halogenated hydrocarbons in the training set

Looking at relevant patterns from the training examples:
- Simple chlorinated compounds like Clc1ccccc1 have low values (0.0)
- Short chain alkanes like CCCCC have high values (1.0)

- Aliphatic chlorinated compounds generally have higher values than aromatic chlorinated compounds

Considering these factors:
1. The molecule is aliphatic (not aromatic) which tends to give higher values
2. It's a very simple structure
3. The presence of chlorine typically reduces the value somewhat
4. It's more similar to simple alkanes than to complex aromatics

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately 0.5 for ClCC.

This prediction takes into account that it's simpler than most molecules in the training set, has characteristics of both high-value alkanes and low-value chlorinated compounds, leading to a middle-range prediction.

Looking at patterns from the examples:
1. Molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have values close to 0
2. Simple chlorinated aliphatics (like ClCC(Cl)Cl) tend to have values close to 1
3. Molecules combining aromatic rings with chlorine substituents often have lower values

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the examples, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.4

This prediction takes into account that it's more complex than simple chlorinated compounds (which score 1.0) but simpler than many of the polycyclic aromatic compounds (which score 0.0), and considers the presence of both aromatic and chlorinated features.

- CCCC(O)CCC (alcohol) = 1.0
- CCC(C)CCO (branched alcohol) = 1.0
- CC(O)c1ccccc1 (alcohol, but aromatic) = 0.25

I notice that:
1. Simple aliphatic alcohols consistently show values of 1.0

3. Only when combined with aromatic groups do alcohols show lower values

Given that CCCCC(C)O is a branched aliphatic alcohol similar to several examples that all have a value of 1.0, and it doesn't contain any aromatic or other functional groups that might lower the value,

The target molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O has:
- A trifluoromethyl group
- An aromatic ring
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle
- Two chlorine atoms
- A ketone group
- A relatively complex structure

Based on these features and comparing to similar molecules in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.3333333333333333

This prediction is based on:
- The presence of halogens (which generally lower the value)
- The moderate complexity of the structure
- The presence of both aromatic and aliphatic regions
- The presence of a ketone group
- Similar molecules in the training set with comparable structural features tend to have values in this range

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.14285714285714285
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict the property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, I notice:
1. It's an aromatic compound with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) and methoxy group (COc)
2. Similar molecules in the training set:
   - O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has value 0.0
   - Other aromatic compounds with nitro groups tend to have low values
   - Molecules with single aromatic rings and substituents typically have values between 0.1-0.3

Key observations from training data:
- Pure aromatic compounds tend to have lower values
- Nitro-containing compounds often have very low values
- The presence of oxygen substituents slightly increases the value compared to pure aromatics

Based on these patterns, and considering this molecule has:
- One nitro group (pushing towards low value)
- One methoxy group (slightly increasing the value)
- Single aromatic ring
- Similar structural features to other low-value compounds

I predict the property value would be approximately 0.2

This takes into account both the lowering effect of the nitro group and the slight increasing effect of the methoxy substituent, while staying consistent with the patterns seen in similar molecules from the training set.

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.8
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

Key observations from the examples:
1. Highly chlorinated molecules (like ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl) tend to have values of 1.0
2. Simple halogenated alkanes (like ClCCCl, CCCCl) consistently show values of 1.0
3. Complex polycyclic structures tend to have lower values
4. The target molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple chlorine atoms

The target molecule ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is:
- A complex polycyclic structure (which typically reduces the value)
- Heavily chlorinated (which typically increases the value)
- Similar in some ways to the hexachlorocyclohexane example which had a value of 1.0
- Has a rigid structure with multiple chlorine substituents

Considering these factors, and giving more weight to the chlorination pattern (which seems to be a stronger predictor in the training set), I would predict a value of:

0.8

This prediction takes into account both the complexity of the structure (which would typically lower the value) and the high degree of chlorination (which tends to increase the value towards 1.0).

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.75
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

CCCOC=O is ethyl propionate, a simple ester.

Looking at the patterns from the training examples:
1. Simple aliphatic molecules (like CCCI, CC(Cl)Cl) tend to have high values (1.0)
2. Short chain esters tend to have moderate values
3. Molecules with C=O groups often have values in the 0.2-0.6 range
4. The presence of oxygen typically reduces the value somewhat compared to pure hydrocarbons
5. Short-chain molecules (3-5 carbons) tend to have moderate values

Given that this is:
- A relatively simple aliphatic molecule (which suggests higher values)
- Contains an ester group (C=O and O, which typically reduces the value)
- Has a short carbon chain (3 carbons)
- Similar in complexity to some other simple esters in the training set

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.5

This takes into account both the aliphatic nature (which would push the value higher) and the presence of the ester group (which would moderate the value downward).

Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.9166666666666666
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns I observe in the training examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is a long-chain ester with:
- A long aliphatic chain (10 carbons)
- An ester group (-C(=O)O-)
- A short ethyl group at the end

Looking at patterns from the training examples:
1. Molecules with long aliphatic chains tend to have higher values (e.g., CCCCC(CC)C=O has 0.875)
2. Simple aliphatic compounds generally have higher values (e.g., CCC1CCCCC1 has 1.0)
3. Presence of oxygen atoms slightly reduces the value compared to pure hydrocarbons
4. Linear molecules tend to have higher values than cyclic or aromatic ones

Based on these observations and considering:
- The predominantly aliphatic nature (which pushes the value higher)
- The presence of the ester group (which slightly reduces it)
- The linear structure
- The similarity to other long-chain aliphatic compounds in the training set

I predict the property value to be approximately 0.8

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is mostly aliphatic (which typically gives high values) but has some functionality (ester group) that would slightly reduce the value from 1.0.

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

Key observations:
1. The molecule contains aromatic rings (benzene rings)
2. Contains multiple functional groups: hydroxyl (-OH), amide (-C(=O)N-), chloro (-Cl), and nitro (-NO2)
3. The structure is relatively complex with substituted aromatics
4. Similar to some training examples with aromatic rings and polar substituents

Looking at the training examples:
- Simple aromatic compounds generally have values close to 0
- Molecules with multiple polar groups and aromatics tend to have low values (0.1-0.3)
- The presence of -OH, -Cl, and -NO2 groups on aromatic rings in the training set typically results in low values
- Similar compounds like "Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl" have a value of 0.0

Based on these patterns and the structural similarity to several training examples, I predict the property value for "Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O" to be:

0.15

This prediction takes into account the molecule's aromatic nature, multiple polar substituents, and similarity to training examples with comparable structural features.

Looking at the given examples, I notice several patterns:
1. Simple linear alkanes/alcohols tend to have values close to 1.0
2. Highly aromatic structures with multiple rings tend to have low values (0.0-0.2)
3. Molecules with mixed functional groups and moderate complexity tend to have middle-range values
4. Presence of phosphorus and sulfur containing groups often leads to values around 0.4-0.5
5. Symmetric structures with similar repeating units tend to have moderate values

The target molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 has:
- Two phosphorothioate groups (P=S)
- Two aromatic rings connected by a sulfur bridge
- Symmetric structure
- Multiple oxygen linkages
- Methoxy groups

Based on these features and comparing to similar structures in the training set (especially those containing P=S groups and aromatic systems), I would predict a property value of:

0.42857142857142855

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate complexity, presence of P=S groups, and symmetric nature, while being similar to other phosphorothioate-containing compounds in the training set.

True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is a nitrophenol - specifically a nitrophenol with the nitro group and hydroxyl group in meta position to each other.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (nitrotoluene) has a value of 0.14285714285714285
2. Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 (meta-substituted) has a value of 0.0
3. NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (salicylamide) has a value of 0.0
4. Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (chlorophenol) has a value of 0.0

I notice that:
1. Molecules with nitro groups tend to have low values
2. Phenols with electron-withdrawing groups often have values close to 0
3. Meta-substituted benzenes in the training set often have low values
4. The combination of polar groups (OH, NO2) on benzene tends to give low values

Based on these patterns, and particularly considering the structural similarity to the nitrotoluene example but with an OH group instead of CH3, I would predict a value of:

0.0

This prediction is based on the presence of both nitro and hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring, and the consistent pattern of similar structures having very low values in the training set.

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice several patterns:
1. Long chain alkanes (like CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC) tend to have values close to 1.0
2. Highly aromatic structures with halogens tend to have values close to 0.0
3. Molecules with many oxygen atoms and hydroxyl groups (like sugars) tend to have values closer to 1.0

- Many hydroxyl (OH) groups
- Multiple oxygen linkages
- No aromatic rings or halogens
- High oxygen content
- Similar to the example C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O which has a value of 1.0

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to other oxygen-rich, hydroxylated molecules in the training set, I would predict a property value of:

0.9

This prediction is based on the molecule's similarity to other highly oxygenated sugar-like structures in the training set, while accounting for its slightly higher complexity compared to the simpler sugar examples.

Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.5
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and the patterns in the training examples to make a prediction.

Looking at the examples, I notice several patterns:
1. Molecules with long aliphatic chains tend to have high values (close to 1.0)
2. Highly aromatic molecules tend to have low values (close to 0)
3. Simple aliphatic molecules with oxygen-containing groups often have values between 0.8-1.0
4. The presence of halogens tends to lower the value

For CCC#C:
- This is a relatively simple aliphatic molecule
- It contains a triple bond (alkyne)
- It has a short carbon chain
- No oxygen-containing groups
- No aromatic rings
- No halogens

Comparing to similar structures in the training set and considering the molecule's features, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.6

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's aliphatic (which generally gives higher values)
2. It's relatively simple
3. The triple bond likely reduces the value somewhat compared to fully saturated chains
4. It's shorter than many of the high-value (>0.8) aliphatic compounds in the training set

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 0.4
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

Key observations from the examples:
1. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms (especially on aromatic rings) tend to have very low values (0.0-0.2)
2. Phosphorus-containing compounds with sulfur (P=S) tend to have moderate values (0.4-0.5)
3. Simple aliphatic compounds tend to have higher values (0.8-1.0)
4. The presence of oxygen bridges and complex ring systems tends to lower the value

For the target molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl:
- It has three chlorine atoms on an aromatic ring (pushing towards lower values)
- It contains a P=S group (moderate values)
- It has ethoxy and ethyl groups (slightly higher values)
- It has an oxygen bridge to the aromatic ring

Considering these factors, especially the presence of multiple chlorines on the aromatic ring balanced against the P=S and alkyl groups, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.3333333333333333

This value reflects that it's a moderately complex molecule with features that tend to both decrease (multiple Cl atoms) and increase (P=S, alkyl groups) the property value.

2. Examples like CCCCCCCO (1.0), CCC(O)CC (1.0), C/C1CCCCC1\C (1.0), CCCC1CCCC1 (1.0) show that saturated hydrocarbons tend to have high values
3. The presence of aromatic rings, halogens, or complex functional groups tends to lower the value
4. Simple, linear molecules with only carbon and hydrogen tend to have high values

Given that CCCCCCCC is:
- A simple, linear alkane
- Contains only carbon and hydrogen
- Has no functional groups
- Is similar to other alkanes in the training set which all have values close to 1.0

   - CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO (0.7273)

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data:
- Steroid-like structures typically have values between 0.7 and 0.85
- The presence of oxygen atoms slightly reduces the value
- The overall complexity and similarity to other steroid examples suggests a value in this range

Considering all these factors, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.78

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to other steroids in the training set while considering the slight modifications in functional groups.

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple hydrocarbons (like CCCCCCCC) tend to have high values (1.0)
2. Presence of double bonds slightly reduces the value compared to saturated analogs
3. Shorter chain molecules tend to have lower values than longer chains
4. Branching appears to have a moderate effect
5. The most similar molecules in the training set are:
   - CCCCC(CC)C=O (0.875)
   - CCCCCCCCC=C (0.8)
   - Simple branched alkanes/alkenes tend to have values between 0.4-0.8

Given that this molecule:
- Is a relatively small hydrocarbon (5 carbons)
- Has one double bond
- Has branching (two methyl groups)
- Is simpler than most examples in the training set

I predict the property value to be approximately 0.6

This takes into account that it's a small molecule (which tends to lower the value) but also considers its hydrocarbon nature (which tends to increase the value), along with the presence of both branching and unsaturation.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and the patterns from the training examples to make a prediction.

Looking at ClCCl (dichloromethane), I notice:
1. It's a very small molecule
2. Contains two chlorine atoms
3. Has a simple C-Cl bonds
4. No complex functional groups
5. Highly symmetrical structure

From the training examples, I observe:
- Simple, small molecules tend to have higher values
- However, molecules with multiple chlorines often have lower values
- Completely halogenated small molecules like ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl have a value of 0.0
- The presence of chlorines generally reduces the property value

Based on these patterns, and considering that ClCCl is:
- Smaller than most examples
- Has two chlorines (negative factor)
- But maintains some C-H bonds (unlike fully halogenated examples)

I would predict a property value of approximately 0.2 for ClCCl.

This prediction takes into account that it should have a lower value than alkanes due to the chlorines, but not as low as fully halogenated or aromatic chlorinated compounds which often show values of 0.0.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a chlorinated phenol with three chlorine atoms and one hydroxyl group on a benzene ring.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (very similar structure) has a value of 0.0
2. Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 (similar trihalogenated benzene) has a value of 0.0
3. Other highly halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have low values

Key observations:
- Molecules with multiple halogens on aromatic rings consistently show very low values
- The presence of hydroxyl group on aromatic ring with halogens doesn't seem to increase the value significantly
- The given molecule is very structurally similar to Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl which has a value of 0.0

Based on these patterns and the very close structural similarity to known examples, I predict the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl to be:

0.0

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.5517241379310345
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples. Let me break down my analysis:

1. The molecule is a complex natural product-like structure with:
- Multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters)
- Fused ring systems
- Hydroxyl groups
- Methylenedioxy group (OCO)
- Methoxy substituents

2. Looking at patterns from the training data:
- Complex molecules with multiple oxygen-containing groups and fused rings tend to have values between 0.2-0.8
- Natural product-like structures with multiple stereocenters and oxygen functionalities (like steroids) typically score around 0.6-0.8
- The presence of aromatic rings tends to lower the value somewhat
- Multiple oxygen-containing substituents and complex connectivity patterns generally result in intermediate values

3. This molecule shares structural similarities with some of the more complex examples in the training set, particularly those containing fused rings and multiple oxygen functionalities.

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.4285714285714285

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, the presence of multiple oxygen-containing groups, and its similarity to other complex natural product-like structures in the training set.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.625
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C has:
- A heterocyclic ring structure containing nitrogen atoms
- A thioether (CS-) group
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)
- An amino substituent (-N)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen atoms typically have values between 0.2-0.7
- The presence of a tert-butyl group appears in CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C which has a value of 0.7
- Sulfur-containing heterocycles like C1SC(=S)NC1(=O) have values around 0.3-0.7
- The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms in a ring system tends to give moderate values

Based on these patterns and the structural similarities, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.65 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account the similar electronic and structural features seen in the training set, particularly the presence of the nnc ring system, the tert-butyl group, and the overall polarity of the molecule.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.2222222222222222
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1:
1. It contains an ethyl ester group (CCOC(=O)-)
2. It has a benzene ring (c1ccccc1)
3. The ester group is directly attached to the benzene ring

Analyzing similar patterns in the training set:
- Molecules with ester groups (like CCCCCC(=O)OC) tend to have values around 0.85-0.86
- Simple aromatic compounds without other functional groups tend to have values close to 0
- When esters are combined with aromatic rings, the values tend to be lower than aliphatic esters but higher than pure aromatics

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to other molecules in the training set, I would predict the property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 to be approximately:

0.4

This prediction takes into account both the presence of the ester group (which typically increases the value) and the aromatic ring (which typically decreases the value), resulting in a moderate value in the middle range.

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns I observe in the training examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl bromide (1-bromoheptane).

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple linear molecules tend to have higher values (like CCCCCCCO = 1.0)
2. Presence of halogens (Br, Cl) in aromatic compounds tends to lower the value (like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 = 0.0)
3. However, simple halogenated alkanes (like CI = 1.0) maintain higher values
4. Linear alkyl chains with functional groups typically have values between 0.75-1.0
5. The length of the carbon chain seems to have some influence, with longer chains maintaining relatively high values

Given that CCCCCCCBr is:
- A linear molecule (which tends to give higher values)
- Contains a single bromine at the terminal position
- Has a relatively long carbon chain
- Is structurally similar to other linear molecules in the training set
- Is not aromatic (which would lower the value)

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.875 for CCCCCCCBr.

Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and the patterns in the training examples to make a prediction.

CO (Carbon monoxide) is a very simple molecule. Looking at the training examples, I notice several patterns:

1. Simple, small molecules tend to have higher values (like CCC with 1.0)
2. Molecules containing oxygen in simple structures often have high values (like alcohols)
3. Very small molecules with polar bonds are generally given high values
4. Molecules containing C-O single bonds often have values closer to 1.0
5. However, this is not CO with a triple bond, but rather carbon monoxide with a double bond

While CO is a small molecule, it's different from most of the training examples as it contains a double bond between C and O. The closest analogues in the training set might be simple molecules like CC#C (0.3333) or other small molecules.

Based on these observations and the molecule's unique characteristics, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.5 for CO.

This prediction takes into account that CO is:
- A very simple molecule (which generally suggests higher values)
- Contains oxygen (often associated with higher values)
- Has a double bond (which tends to lower values somewhat)
- Is smaller than most training examples
