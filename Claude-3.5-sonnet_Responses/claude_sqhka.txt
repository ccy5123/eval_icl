SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.6033356903449983
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl decanoate), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1. This is an ester with a long alkyl chain
2. Similar structures in the training set include:
- CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl dodecanoate) with value -0.60333569
- CCOC(=O)CC (ethyl propanoate) with value -0.60333569
- CC(C)COC(=O)C (isobutyl acetate) with value -0.60333569

I notice that esters with different chain lengths seem to have very similar values around -0.60333569. The presence of the ester group (-C(=O)OC) appears to be the dominant factor rather than the length of the alkyl chain.

Given these patterns, I would predict that CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would have a property value of:

-0.60333569

This prediction is based on the consistent pattern seen with other ester compounds in the training set, particularly noting that different chain lengths don't seem to significantly affect this particular property when the ester functional group is present.

True Property: 0.02388306718537298
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule is a barbituric acid derivative with an alkyl substituent. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a value of 0.02388307
2. The target molecule is very similar but has an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) instead of just a methyl group

Key observations:
- The core structure (barbituric acid) is identical

This takes into account:
- The base value of the similar structure (0.02388307)
- A small positive contribution from the additional alkyl chain
- The maintained presence of the CC=C group
- The overall molecular size and polarity

   - c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 (pentacene) has a value of 2.46736791
   - Other fused ring systems tend to have positive values
   - Simpler aromatic systems tend to have values between -1 and 1

4) The target molecule is smaller than pentacene but still has a fused ring system
5) It has no functional groups, only hydrocarbon structure

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict a value of approximately 0.9 to 1.2 for this molecule.

My specific prediction is: 0.96

This takes into account that it's a PAH (which tend to have positive values in the dataset) but is smaller than pentacene (which has a value of 2.46736791), and considers the general trend that simpler aromatic systems tend to have more moderate values.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.6033356903449983
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

CC(C)OC=O is a formate ester (specifically isopropyl formate).

Looking at similar patterns in the training data:
1. CC(C)CCOC=O (isopentyl formate) has a value of -0.60333569
2. CCCCCOC(=O)C (amyl acetate) has a value of -0.60333569
3. CC(=O)N (acetamide) has a value of -0.60333569

I notice that molecules containing the C(=O)O group (esters) consistently show values around -0.60333569. The molecule in question is also an ester with a similar structure to these examples.

Based on these observations and the consistent pattern for similar esters in the training set, I predict the property value for CC(C)OC=O to be:

-0.60333569

This prediction is based on the structural similarity to other esters in the training set and the apparent consistency of this property value for molecules containing similar functional groups.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.8479312404848627
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule "Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1" is a benzene ring with:
- Two methyl groups (C)
- One hydroxyl group (O)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple phenols like "c1ccccc1O" have a value around -0.84793124
- Molecules with methyl substitutions on benzene like "CCc1ccccc1C" have values around -0.82157751
- Other substituted aromatics with hydroxyl groups like "Oc2ccc1CCCCc1c2" have values around -0.84793124

The target molecule is relatively simple and has structural similarities to these examples. It's a phenol with additional methyl groups, which should result in a value in a similar range.

Based on these patterns and considering that:
1. The base phenol structure typically gives values around -0.84
2. Methyl substitutions tend to make small modifications to this base value
3. The overall complexity is relatively low

I predict the property value would be approximately: -0.83

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a value close to simple phenols but slightly modified by the presence of the two methyl groups.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.3643403076830839
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is an organophosphate compound with:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S))
- Methoxy groups (OC)
- A phenyl ring with methylthio (SC) and methyl (C) substituents

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (2.2828918)
2. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl (4.60201998)
3. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl (3.20609588)

These similar compounds have the same phosphorothioate core structure but differ in the aromatic substituents. The training examples have halogen substituents which generally increase the property value. Our target molecule has less electronegative substituents (SC and C) compared to the halogens.

Considering these factors, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

2.1

This prediction is slightly lower than the chlorinated analog (2.2828918) because the SC and C substituents typically contribute less to this property than chlorine atoms.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.22680678285696493
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided.

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has several key characteristics:
1. It's a biaryl system (two benzene rings connected)
2. Contains 5 chlorine atoms
3. Has structural similarity to some of the training examples, particularly the polychlorinated biphenyls

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl atoms) has value 1.13913995
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (7 Cl atoms) has value 2.3285167

Our target molecule has 5 chlorine atoms and a similar biaryl core structure, but slightly fewer chlorines than these reference compounds. The property appears to increase with the number of chlorine atoms in similar structures.

Given these considerations and the fact that our molecule has one less chlorine than the first reference compound, I would predict a property value of approximately:

1.0

This prediction takes into account that the property value should be slightly lower than 1.13913995 due to having one less chlorine, while maintaining the core structural contribution to the property.

1) It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2) Contains a short carbon chain (propyl)
3) Has oxygen-containing functional group
4) Similar polarity and size to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- Simple alkanes (CCC) have values around 0.54
- Molecules with N(=O)=O groups tend to increase the value
- Small molecules with oxygen-containing groups often have negative values
- The complexity and size of this molecule is relatively low

Considering these factors and patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account that:
1) The molecule is relatively small (pushing toward negative values)
2) Contains a nitro group (which tends to make the value more negative based on patterns seen)
3) Has a short alkyl chain (which would slightly increase the value)
4) Shows similarity to other small molecules with oxygen-containing groups in the training set

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobromobenzene, where fluorine and bromine are substituted at different positions on the benzene ring.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of 0.51010937 (similar dihalogenated benzene)
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 patterns show halogen substitutions affect the value
- Aromatic compounds with halogens generally show values between -1 and 1 in the dataset

Considering that:
1. Bromine and fluorine are both halogens (like chlorine)
2. The pattern shows that dihalogenated benzenes tend to have values around 0.5
3. Fluorine is smaller and more electronegative than chlorine, which might slightly decrease the value compared to the chloro-bromo analog

Based on these considerations, I would predict a value of approximately 0.48 for Fc1cccc(Br)c1.

3. Most similar examples from the training set:
- CC(C)(C)CO (0.42165967)
- CC1CCCO1 (0.42165967)
- Other cyclic structures with -OH groups tend to have values in this range

4. Considering the structural features and patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 to be approximately:

0.38

This prediction takes into account the molecule's similarity to other cyclic alcohols in the training set while considering its more complex bicyclic nature and methyl substitutions.

- Molecules containing phthalimide groups typically show values in the range of -0.5 to 0.5
- The presence of ethoxy groups generally contributes to slightly negative values
- The overall size and complexity is moderate, similar to examples with values near zero

Considering these factors and comparing to the most similar structures in the training set (especially CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O which has a value of -0.45839018), I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.42

This prediction takes into account that the target molecule is slightly less complex than some of the similar training examples but maintains key structural features that influence the property.

True Property: 0.3361747594851587
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a pyrazolone derivative with:
- A pyrazolone core (5-membered ring with N-N and C=O)
- A phenyl substituent
- Two methyl groups

Looking at the training examples:
1. Molecules with heterocyclic rings containing N atoms often have values between 1.5-3.0
2. Presence of C=O in cyclic systems tends to increase the value
3. N-phenyl substitutions generally contribute positively
4. The molecule's complexity and structure is somewhat similar to "O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23" (2.56158249)

Considering these factors and the structural similarities with several training examples, particularly those containing nitrogen heterocycles with carbonyl groups and phenyl substituents, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.6033356903449983
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCCCCC(=O)OCC is an ester with:
- A straight chain of 6 carbons on one side
- An ethyl group (CC) on the other side of the ester linkage
- Contains a C(=O)O ester group

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Simple esters like COC=O have values around -0.60
- Longer chain esters like CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC also have values around -0.60
- The presence of straight alkyl chains tends to make values slightly more positive
- Ester functional groups generally contribute to negative values

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to other esters in the training set, I predict the property value for CCCCCC(=O)OCC to be approximately:

-0.55

This prediction takes into account:
1. The base ester contribution (around -0.60)
2. A slight positive shift due to the longer alkyl chain
3. The similarity to other ester compounds in the training set
==================================================
Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6033356903449987
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns that can help predict the property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate):

1. The molecule contains an ester group (COC(=O)-) attached to a benzene ring
2. Similar structures in the training set include:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) with value -0.60333569
- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 with value -0.28050251

The target molecule is very similar to ethyl benzoate, with the only difference being one less carbon in the alkyl chain (methyl vs ethyl). Since the core structure is identical and the only difference is a slightly shorter alkyl chain, I would expect the property value to be very close to that of ethyl benzoate (-0.60333569).

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 to be approximately:

-0.60

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The core structure is nearly identical to ethyl benzoate
2. The small change in alkyl chain length typically doesn't cause major changes in this property
3. The value should be negative based on similar structures in the training set

- C=Cc1ccccc1 (vinyl group) has value -0.83014247
- Simple hydrocarbons like C1CCCC1 has value 0.54025145

Given that C=CCC=C is:
- A simple hydrocarbon
- Has two double bonds
- Is relatively small and linear
- Structurally most similar to CC/C=C/C but with an additional double bond

I would predict a value around -0.15 to -0.20, specifically:

-0.17526

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's likely to be in a similar range as other simple hydrocarbons
2. The presence of double bonds seems to slightly decrease the value
3. It's more complex than CC/C=C/C but simpler than aromatic compounds

True Property: -0.13638054916889394
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples and analyzing the given molecule CC/C=C\C (cis-2-pentene), I notice several patterns:

1. This molecule is an isomer of CC/C=C/C (trans-2-pentene) which has a value of -0.13638055
2. The molecule is relatively small and simple, containing a single double bond
3. It's a hydrocarbon with no functional groups
4. The only difference from its trans isomer is the geometry around the double bond

Given that:
- Simple hydrocarbons tend to have values between -1 and 1 in the dataset
- The trans isomer has a value of -0.13638055
- Cis-trans isomers often have similar but slightly different values
- Cis isomers are typically slightly less stable than trans isomers

CCCOCC is a relatively simple aliphatic ether with:
- A linear chain structure
- An oxygen atom in the middle
- No cyclic structures
- No aromatic rings
- No functional groups other than the ether

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- Simple aliphatic molecules tend to have values around 0.4 to 0.6
- The presence of oxygen typically reduces the value somewhat compared to pure hydrocarbons
- Linear structures similar to this tend to have moderate positive values
- C1CCCCCC1 (cycloheptane) has a value of 0.54025145
- Simple alcohols like CC(C)O have values around 0.42165967

Taking all these factors into consideration, and noting that this molecule is slightly more complex than methanol but simpler than cycloheptane, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.45

This prediction takes into account that the ether linkage will likely reduce the value somewhat compared to a pure hydrocarbon, but the overall simple aliphatic nature of the molecule suggests a moderate positive value in this range.

The most similar molecule in the training set has a value of 7.55890841, but this molecule has fewer chlorine atoms. Generally:
- Chlorinated aromatics tend to have higher values
- The more chlorine atoms, the higher the value
- Biphenyl structures contribute to higher values

Given these patterns and considering this molecule has fewer chlorines than the similar example but maintains the basic PCB structure, I would predict a value of approximately:

6.85

This prediction takes into account that the value should be:
- Lower than 7.55890841 (the fully chlorinated analog)
- Higher than most other molecules in the dataset
- Similar to other halogenated aromatics

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 2.8521323543581727
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ClCCl - dichloromethane) by comparing it to the training examples and looking for patterns, particularly focusing on similar structures and functional groups.

Key observations:
1. The molecule is small and symmetric
2. Contains two chlorine atoms
3. Similar to other halogenated small molecules in the dataset
4. Most relevant comparison molecule is "ClCCCl" which has a value of 2.85213235

Looking at the patterns:
- Small halogenated molecules tend to have positive values
- The presence of multiple chlorines typically increases the value
- ClCCl is slightly smaller than ClCCCl but has the same number of chlorines
- Other halogenated compounds in the dataset also show relatively high positive values

Based on these observations and considering that ClCCl is very similar to ClCCCl but slightly smaller, I would predict a value of approximately:

2.75

This prediction takes into account that the property value should be slightly lower than ClCCCl (2.85213235) due to the shorter carbon chain, while maintaining a high positive value characteristic of small chlorinated compounds.

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.8479312404848627
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a dimethylphenol (two methyl groups on a phenol ring).

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (-0.84793124) - very similar, has methyl groups and OH
2. Oc1cccc(O)c1 (-0.74251632) - phenol structure but with two OH groups
3. c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC (-0.74251632) - phenol with substituents
4. Cc1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (3.6849102) - different substituents

The target molecule is most similar to the first example (CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O), which has a value of -0.84793124. While they're not identical, they share key features:
- Both have OH group
- Both have methyl substituents
- Similar overall size and structure

Given these similarities and the general trend of phenolic compounds in the dataset tending toward negative values, I would predict the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O to be approximately:

-0.82

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly simpler than the closest analog but maintains the key structural features that appear to drive the property value in this chemical space.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.40848280427398204
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl has these key characteristics:
1. It's a biaryl system (two benzene rings connected)
2. Contains 4 chlorine atoms
3. Has similar structural features to some molecules in the training set

Looking at similar molecules from the training examples:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl atoms) has value 1.13913995
- Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (5 Cl atoms) has value 0.22680678
- Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl (4 Cl atoms) has value 1.13913995

The target molecule is most similar to these structures, particularly the first two as they also have biaryl systems with chlorine substitutions. However, our target has 4 chlorines, which is fewer than the first two examples but matches more closely with other chlorinated aromatics in the dataset.

Based on these comparisons and the general trend observed in the training data, I would predict the property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl to be approximately:

0.95

This prediction takes into account that the value should be:
1. Lower than the 6-chlorine biaryl system (1.13913995)
2. Higher than the simple chlorinated benzenes
3. Adjusted for the specific substitution pattern and number of chlorines

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.13638054916889394
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is 2-methylbut-2-ene, a small branched alkene.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Small, simple hydrocarbons tend to have values between -1.0 and 0.5
2. Molecules with simple C=C bonds generally have slightly lower values than their saturated counterparts
3. The molecule is similar in size and structure to some of the simpler examples

Considering similar molecules in the training set:
- CCCCCCCC (straight chain alkane) has value 0.54025145
- Simple aromatic hydrocarbons like CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 have value -0.82157751
- COC(=O)C=C (containing C=C) has value -0.8260247

Given that this molecule is:
- A small hydrocarbon
- Contains a double bond
- Has branching
- Is relatively simple in structure

I predict the property value would be approximately -0.65

This prediction takes into account that alkenes tend to have slightly lower values than alkanes, and the branching would likely place it in a moderate negative range based on the patterns observed in the training data.

Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 2.8521323543581727
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a very small molecule with just two carbons
2. It has two chlorine atoms
3. It's symmetric
4. It has no aromatic rings, no complex functional groups
5. Looking at similar simple halogenated compounds in the training set:
   - ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a value of 4.60201998
   - Other chlorinated compounds tend to have higher values
   - However, this molecule is much simpler than most examples

The molecule is significantly smaller than most training examples, but follows the pattern that chlorinated compounds tend to have moderate to high values. However, being much smaller and simpler than tetrachloroethene (ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl), it should have a lower value.

Based on these considerations, I would predict a value of approximately:

2.8

This prediction takes into account that it's a simple chlorinated compound (pushing the value up from baseline), but is smaller and less complex than most high-value chlorinated compounds in the training set.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.22680678285696493
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms in multiple positions and a hydroxyl group.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (very similar, just different chlorine positions) has value 0.22680678
2. Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 (similar trihalogenated benzene) has value 3.25797979
3. Other halogenated compounds like ClCC has value 1.55767011
4. CC(Cl)CCl has value 2.85213235

The target molecule is most similar to the first reference compound Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, as it's also a trichlorinated phenol with the same number and types of substituents, just in slightly different positions.

Given the very close structural similarity to the first reference compound, and considering the small effect of positional isomerism, I would predict a value very close to 0.22680678, perhaps slightly higher due to the specific chlorine arrangement.

My prediction for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl would be approximately 0.25

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 8.712707620032583
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The given molecule is a complex natural product-like structure with:
- Multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters)
- Fused ring systems
- Aromatic rings with methoxy substituents
- A methylenedioxy group
- Multiple stereocenters
- Hydroxyl groups

2. Looking at the training examples:
- Complex molecules with multiple oxygen-containing groups tend to have negative values
- Natural product-like structures with multiple rings often have values between -1 and 1
- The presence of aromatic rings with oxygen substituents typically leads to moderate negative values
- Molecules with similar complexity and polarity tend to have values in the -0.8 to 0.5 range

3. This molecule shares structural similarities with several of the training examples, particularly the complex steroidal and natural product-like structures which typically showed values around -0.7 to -0.8.

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately:

-0.73

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, and its similarity to other natural product-like structures in the training set.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.8301424732019634
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, I notice:
1. It contains a heterocyclic ring with multiple nitrogen atoms
2. Has a thioether (CSc-) group
3. Contains a carbonyl group
4. Has a tert-butyl substituent (C(C)(C)C)
5. Has an amino substituent (-N)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a value of -0.71533904
- This is particularly relevant as it also contains an nnc ring system and a tert-butyl group
- Other heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen atoms tend to have values in the negative range
- The presence of sulfur and carbonyl groups typically doesn't push the value extremely high or low

Based on these observations and the structural similarities, I would predict a value of approximately -0.65 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that the molecule shares several structural features with compounds that have negative values in the training set, particularly those containing heterocyclic rings with multiple nitrogens and similar substituents.

Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6033356903449987
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate, which contains:
- An aromatic ring (benzene)
- An ester group (-COO-)
- An ethyl group (CC-)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with aromatic rings generally have values between -0.8 and 0.3
- Esters (like CCCC(=O)OC and CCCCC(=O)OCC) tend to have values around -0.60
- The presence of oxygen-containing groups often pulls the value slightly negative
- Simple aromatic compounds with similar substituents show values in the -0.5 to -0.8 range

Considering these patterns and the structural similarity to other molecules in the training set, particularly other esters and aromatic compounds, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.55

This prediction takes into account:
1. The presence of the ester group (pulling negative like other esters)
2. The aromatic ring (moderating the negative pull somewhat)
3. The overall size and complexity of the molecule
4. The similarity to other compounds in the training set with comparable functional groups

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 2.3744710106506948
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCCCBr, 1-bromoheptane) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple halogenated alkanes tend to have moderate positive values (like CI at 3.63039092)
2. Longer chain alkanes and their derivatives tend to have values closer to zero or slightly negative
3. The presence of bromine in aromatic systems (like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1) shows negative values (-0.83738975)
4. Simple aliphatic chains (like CCCCCCC=C) show values around -0.13638055

For CCCCCCCBr:
- It's a straight-chain alkyl bromide
- Has 7 carbons (relatively long chain)
- Terminal bromine
- Similar in structure to some of the aliphatic examples, but with a bromine instead of other functional groups

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's less polar than CI
2. Has a similar chain length to some negative-valued examples
3. The bromine would contribute some positive value but the long chain would moderate this
4. It's structurally similar to CCCCCCC=C (-0.13638055) but with Br instead of double bond

Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 0.4216596689279815
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (methanol - CO) by comparing it to the training examples and looking for patterns in molecular structure and corresponding property values.

Looking at the training set, I notice:
1. Small, simple molecules tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. Alcohols (compounds with -OH groups) like OC1CCCCCC1 and CCC(C)CO have values around 0.42
3. Very small molecules with oxygen tend to be slightly negative
4. The simplest molecules in the set (like CCC) have values around 0.54

Methanol (CO) is:
- A very simple molecule
- Contains an oxygen (alcohol group)
- Smaller than most molecules in the training set
- Similar to other simple alcohols but with minimal carbon chain

Based on these observations and patterns, particularly looking at other simple molecules and alcohols in the training set, I would predict the property value for methanol (CO) to be approximately:

0.42

This prediction takes into account the alcohol functionality and the simple structure, aligning with similar compounds in the training set.
