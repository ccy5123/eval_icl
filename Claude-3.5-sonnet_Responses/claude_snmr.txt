SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.6471701845248036
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (methyl decanoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Long chain esters tend to have negative values (e.g., CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC has -0.29512381)
2. Simpler esters like CCOC(=O)CC have values around -0.79820577
3. The length of the carbon chain affects the value
4. The presence of the ester group (C(=O)OC) is a key structural feature

The target molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester with a 10-carbon chain, which is slightly shorter than the example with 12 carbons (-0.29512381).

Considering these factors and the general trends in the data, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account that:
- It should be negative (like other similar esters)
- It should be close to but slightly more negative than the C12 ester example
- The shorter chain length would likely make it slightly more negative

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.18956268082586467
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Aromatic rings generally contribute positively to the property
2. Simple oxygen-containing functional groups often lead to moderate values
3. The presence of an aldehyde group (C=O) tends to modify the base aromatic value
4. Similar structures like COc1ccccc1 (anisole) has a value of 0.22790347

For benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1):
- It has a simple aromatic ring (like many examples)

- Structure is relatively simple compared to many examples
- Most similar to some of the simpler aromatic compounds in the dataset

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for benzaldehyde to be approximately:

0.31

This prediction takes into account that benzaldehyde should have a value:
- Higher than anisole (0.22790347) due to the stronger electron-withdrawing nature of the aldehyde group
- Lower than more complex polycyclic aromatics
- Within the general range seen for simple aromatic compounds with oxygen-containing substituents

2. It has a cyclic urea structure (dihydropyrimidine-2,4-dione core)
3. Contains a hydrazone linkage
4. Has multiple electron-withdrawing groups (nitro, carbonyl)

Looking at the patterns in the training set:

1. The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally very similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training examples, which has a value of -0.16362273

2. The key difference is that our target molecule has an N-N single bond instead of an N=N double bond

3. Looking at the patterns in the training data:
- Molecules with similar aromatic systems tend to have values in similar ranges
- The presence of N-N bonds vs N=N bonds typically doesn't cause dramatic changes in this property
- The overall size and conjugation of the system appears similar

4. Given that the structure is nearly identical to the reference compound, with just a small electronic difference due to the single vs double bond, I would expect the property value to be close to but slightly different from -0.16362273

Based on my chemical expertise and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 to be approximately:

-0.14

This prediction takes into account that the single N-N bond would likely cause a small positive shift in the property value compared to the N=N analog.

True Property: 0.30310089296996795
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 4 chlorine atoms. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl atoms) has value 0.37957867
2. Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (5 Cl atoms) has value -0.92995813
3. Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl (4 Cl atoms) has value -0.13586973

The target molecule is most similar to these structures, particularly in having multiple chlorine substituents on a biphenyl core. It has fewer chlorines than the first two examples but the same number as the third (though in a different arrangement).

Considering these structural similarities and the pattern of values, I would predict the property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl to be approximately:

-0.25

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has:
- A biphenyl core (like examples 1 and 2)
- 4 chlorine substituents (intermediate between the examples)
- A similar electronic character to the training examples
- No other functional groups that might significantly alter the property

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.29596385604295766
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (2-methylbut-2-ene) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice that:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have values between -0.9 and 0.9
2. Small molecules with double bonds often have values in the moderate range
3. Molecules with branched methyl groups show some consistency in their values
4. The absence of complex functional groups or aromatic systems suggests a more moderate value

The target molecule CC=C(C)C is:
- A small hydrocarbon
- Contains one double bond
- Has branched methyl groups
- Is relatively simple in structure

Comparing it specifically to similar structures in the training set:
- CCCCCCCCC=C (-0.12039444) - larger but has similar unsaturation
- Cc1ccccc1C (0.91391548) - different structure but similar carbon count
- CCCCCCCC (0.47816034) - similar size but fully saturated

Based on these observations and the molecule's characteristics, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.32

This prediction takes into account the molecule's small size, presence of a double bond, and branching pattern, placing it in a moderate positive range but not as extreme as more complex structures.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.13770303711738052
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (dichloromethane, CH2Cl2) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Small, halogenated molecules tend to have negative values
2. Molecules with multiple chlorines often have values between -0.6 and -0.8
3. Simple, symmetric structures tend to have more moderate values
4. The molecule ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a value of -0.63161675, which is somewhat similar in terms of chlorine content

Given that ClCCl (dichloromethane) is:
- A very small molecule
- Contains two chlorine atoms
- Has a symmetric structure
- Is simpler than tetrachloroethene (the example mentioned above)

I would predict a value of approximately -0.55

This prediction takes into account that it's smaller and simpler than many of the negative-valued chlorinated compounds in the training set, but still maintains characteristics that typically lead to negative values in the given property scale.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.806693043308517
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms in multiple positions and a hydroxyl group.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (very similar structure) has a value of -0.80669304
2. Other halogenated aromatics like Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 has a value of 0.35866711
3. Phenolic compounds like CC(=O)Nc1ccc(O)cc1 has a value of -0.6454202

The target molecule is most similar to the first example, which is also a trichlorinated phenol. The only difference is the position of the chlorine atoms. Since the electronic and steric effects would be very similar, I would expect the property value to be very close to -0.80669304.

Taking into account these factors and the slight differences in chlorine positioning, I predict the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl to be approximately:

-0.78

This prediction takes into account that the property value should be slightly less negative than the training example due to the different substitution pattern, but still maintaining a similar overall electronic and steric character.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -0.3215228489464428
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters, hydroxyl groups)
2. It has a complex polycyclic structure with multiple rings
3. Contains OCO (methylenedioxy) group which is characteristic of natural products
4. Has multiple stereogenic centers
5. Contains both aromatic and aliphatic regions
6. Has similarities to some glycosides in the training set

Looking at the patterns in the example data:
- Complex molecules with multiple oxygen-containing groups tend to have values between 0.5 and 1.0
- Natural product-like structures with multiple rings often have positive values
- Presence of glycosidic linkages typically contributes to positive values
- Molecules with mixed aromatic/aliphatic character tend toward moderate positive values

Based on these observations and the structural features of the given molecule, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.64

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, and its similarity to other natural product-like structures in the training set.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A heterocyclic ring with multiple nitrogen atoms
- A thioether (CSc-)
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)
- A carbonyl group

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Compounds with heterocyclic rings containing multiple N atoms tend to have values around -0.7 to 0.3
- The presence of thioether groups often contributes to slightly negative values
- Molecules with tert-butyl groups typically shift values toward positive
- The combination of carbonyl and amino groups on heterocycles shows moderate negative values

Considering all these structural features and their contributions, and comparing to the most similar molecules in the training set (especially CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C which has a value of 0.15495387), I would predict the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C to be approximately:

-0.31

This prediction takes into account the similar electronic effects, molecular size, and functional group combinations seen in the training set.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6422854335365197
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ethyl benzoate) and predict its property value based on the given training examples.

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Molecules with ester groups (C(=O)O) tend to have positive values
2. Simple aromatic systems with ester substituents generally show values between 0.2 and 0.9
3. The ethoxy group (CCOC) combined with aromatic systems typically contributes to a positive value
4. The size and complexity of this molecule is moderate, suggesting a moderate positive value

Comparing specifically to similar structures in the training set:
- CCCCCC(=O)OC has a value of 0.92615113
- CCCCC(=O)OCC has a value of 0.92615113
- Simple aromatic compounds with substituents tend to have values between 0.1 and 0.8

Given these patterns and the structural features of ethyl benzoate (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1), I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account the presence of the ester group, the aromatic ring, and the overall molecular size and complexity, while considering the trends observed in the training data.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.6815542481957251
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (1-bromoheptane, CCCCCCCBr) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple linear alkyl halides tend to have positive values
2. Molecules with similar structural features (long alkyl chains with a halogen) like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 have values around 0.87
3. Linear alkyl chains like CCCCCCCO have values around 0.90
4. The presence of bromine (Br) as a terminal group appears to contribute positively to the property value

Considering these patterns and the structural similarity to other linear alkyl chains in the dataset, particularly CCCCCCCO (0.90877021), but accounting for the difference between -Br vs -OH terminal group, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account that bromoalkanes typically show similar but slightly lower values compared to their alcohol counterparts in this property space, based on the patterns observed in the training set.

- Single bonds only
- Small molecular weight
- Polar nature

Looking at the patterns in the training set:
1. Simple, small molecules tend to have negative values

3. The simplest molecules in the training set like CCC (-0.08156871) show values closer to zero or slightly negative
4. Compounds with oxygen generally contribute to more negative values unless part of complex structures

Based on these observations and considering CO's:
- Very simple structure
