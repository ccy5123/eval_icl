SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 1042.3948101001924
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict the property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester with a long alkyl chain (10 carbons in the main chain).

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (12 carbons) has a value of 1068.80843425
- Long chain alkanes (CCCCCC, CCCCCC(C)C) have values around 1214.08336706
- Shorter esters like CCOC(=O)CC have values around 836.36854175

3. Contains the C(=O)OC group which tends to reduce the value compared to pure alkanes

I would predict a value of approximately 1014.52 for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC

This prediction places the value:
- Lower than pure alkanes (~1214)
- Higher than shorter esters (~836)
- Slightly lower than the 12-carbon ester (1068)
- In a reasonable range considering the structural patterns

Given these observations and the structural similarity to O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, but accounting for the additional aliphatic substituent, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

33.72453797

This prediction is based primarily on the very close structural similarity to the known barbiturate example, as the core determining structure appears to be the barbiturate ring system, and the additional aliphatic substituents likely don't significantly alter the property in this case.

Predicted Property:
Looking at the patterns in the given examples, I notice that molecules with similar structural features tend to have similar property values. The target molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is a methyl benzoate, which is structurally very similar to some examples in the training set, particularly:

CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (-254.80762025)
CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 (-254.80762025)

These molecules share the core structure of an ester group attached to a benzene ring. The main difference is just the length of the alkyl group (methyl vs ethyl).

Given the exact match of property values for similar structures and the very close structural similarity, I would predict that COC(=O)c1ccccc1 would have a property value of:

-254.80762025

1. Simple, linear hydrocarbons tend to have higher positive values
2. Molecules with similar structural features tend to have similar values
3. The molecule C=CCC=C is a simple hydrocarbon with two double bonds

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:

- Simple hydrocarbons like CCC(C)(C)CC (1214.08336706)
- C=Cc1ccccc1 (-674.49075948, but this has an aromatic ring)

The target molecule C=CCC=C is most similar to CC/C=C/C, but has an additional double bond. It's a simple, linear hydrocarbon like many of the high-value examples, but the presence of two double bonds might reduce the value somewhat compared to fully saturated hydrocarbons.

Based on these patterns, I would predict a value around 458.65371644 for C=CCC=C, as it's very similar to CC/C=C/C in terms of size and structure, with the main difference being the additional double bond which likely wouldn't cause a dramatic change in this property.

Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. The molecule CC/C=C\C is very similar to CC/C=C/C which has a value of 458.65371644
2. The only difference is the stereochemistry of the double bond (\ vs /)

Given that:
- The molecular formula is identical

The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is ethylbenzene with an additional methyl group (isopropyl benzene, also known as cumene).

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple aromatic compounds with alkyl substituents tend to have values around -50 to 100
2. For example:
   - CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethyltoluene) has value -44.96605063
   - CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (p-cymene) has value 80.93889114
   - Cc1cccc2ccccc12 (methylnaphthalene) has value -502.80220252

The target molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is structurally most similar to these examples, particularly to p-cymene, just with the methyl group replaced by an ethyl group.

Based on these structural similarities and patterns, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

80.93889114

This prediction is based on the very similar structure to p-cymene (CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1), which has this exact value, and the fact that similar aromatic compounds with alkyl substituents tend to fall in this range.

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this data, I notice that the property values seem to follow certain patterns based on molecular structure and functional groups. The target molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, a relatively simple aromatic compound with a formyl (CHO) group.

Looking at the training examples, I observe that:
1. Aromatic compounds tend to have negative values
2. Simple benzene derivatives often have values in the -400 to -700 range

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is a nitrophenol - specifically a nitrobenzene with a hydroxyl group.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (nitrotoluene) has a value of -404.69445569
- Simple substituted benzenes with electron-withdrawing groups like Cl often have values around -674.49075948
- Phenols like Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 have values around -202.34722784

The target molecule combines features of both nitro compounds and phenols. It's most similar structurally to the nitrotoluene example, but with OH instead of CH3. Since OH is more electron-donating than CH3, but we're still maintaining the nitro group, I would expect the value to be between the nitrotoluene and phenol examples.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-404.69445569

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has the same core nitrobenzene structure as the closest matching example, and the hydroxyl substitution likely won't drastically change the property value in this case.

- CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO (699.01769618)

These are the most similar structures, also being steroid-based with ketone and hydroxyl groups. However, our target molecule has an additional alkyne group, which might affect the property value.

Based on the structural similarities and patterns, and considering the presence of the alkyne group which might slightly modify the property, I would predict a value around:

850-900, specifically approximately 877.5

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is very similar to the first example shown above (915.88745234) but the presence of the alkyne group and slightly different substitution pattern would likely modify the value somewhat downward.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 458.6537164440847
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and the patterns in the training examples to make a prediction.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is 2-methylbut-2-ene, a relatively simple branched alkene.

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have high positive values
2. Molecules with double bonds tend to have lower values than fully saturated ones
3. Small molecules generally have lower values than larger molecules
4. Branching seems to affect the value
5. The presence of C=C appears to reduce the value compared to similar saturated structures

The closest analogous molecules in the training set are:
- CCCCCCCCC=C (836.36854175) - much larger alkene
- CCCCCCCC (1214.08336706) - saturated, larger
- COC(=O)C=C (-202.34722784) - small molecule with C=C but has other functionalities
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (80.93889114) - branched but aromatic

Given that CC=C(C)C is:
- A small molecule (5 carbons)
- Contains one double bond
- Has branching
- No other functional groups

I would predict a value of approximately 120.5

This takes into account that it should be:
- Much lower than the large alkenes/alkanes
- Higher than molecules with oxygen or aromatic groups
- In the positive range
- Affected by both branching and unsaturation

-674.49075948

This prediction is based on the consistent pattern seen with other chlorinated compounds in the training set, particularly the simpler ones with multiple chlorine atoms.
