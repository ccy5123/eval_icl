SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 1.075010624847764
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester of a long-chain fatty acid (decanoic acid methyl ester).

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
1. CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (12-carbon chain) has a value of 2.64866233
2. Longer carbon chains tend to increase the value
3. Ester groups (-C(=O)OC) generally contribute to moderate positive values
4. The given molecule has 10 carbons in the chain (slightly shorter than example 1)

Given that this molecule is similar to CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC but with two fewer carbons in the chain, and considering the general trend that longer carbon chains increase the value, I would predict the property value to be:

Predicted value: 2.15

This prediction takes into account that:
- It should be lower than 2.64866233 (the 12-carbon version)
- The ester group contribution remains the same
- The slightly shorter carbon chain would reduce the value somewhat
- But it's still a relatively long hydrophobic chain that would contribute to a positive value

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.3702912378258616
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is a benzoxazinone derivative with:
- A chlorine substituent
- A fused bicyclic system
- An oxazinone ring (containing O, C=O, and NH)
- Aromatic character

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Molecules with similar size and complexity tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. Chlorinated aromatics generally increase the value
3. Presence of oxygen and nitrogen in heterocycles tends to decrease the value
4. Fused ring systems typically have values around 0 to 3

Considering these factors:
- The chlorine will contribute positively
- The heterocyclic nature with O and NH will contribute negatively
- The fused bicyclic system will contribute slightly positively
- The overall size and complexity is moderate

Based on these considerations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account the balancing effect between the chlorine (which would increase the value) and the heterocyclic oxygen/nitrogen system (which would decrease it).

Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7864606998094001
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite, a relatively small molecule with:
- A nitrite group (-N(=O)=O)
- An isopropyl group (CC(C)-)
- No aromatic rings
- Some polarity due to the nitrite group

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Small molecules with oxygen-containing groups tend to have negative values
- Molecules with nitro/nitrite groups like "Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO" have values around -0.9
- Simple aliphatic molecules tend to have values between -0.6 and 0
- The presence of N(=O)=O group typically pushes the value lower

Based on these observations and the structural similarities with other molecules in the training set, I would predict the property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O to be approximately:

-0.85

This prediction takes into account the molecule's size, polarity, and the presence of the nitrite group, while comparing it to similar structures in the training set.

Iteration: 4
SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 0.2904868291300682
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the given molecule (CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO), I notice:

1. It's a complex steroid-like structure
2. Contains multiple ring systems (4 fused rings)
3. Has oxygen-containing functional groups (ketone, hydroxyl)
4. Contains multiple chiral centers
5. Similar in complexity to the steroid example in the training set: CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C (which had a value of 4.75187365)

Considering these factors:
- The overall structure is very similar to the steroid example
- It has slightly more polar groups (additional hydroxyl group)
- The molecular size and complexity are comparable
- The presence of multiple oxygen-containing groups might slightly decrease the value compared to the similar steroid structure

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

4.52

This prediction is slightly lower than the similar steroid structure (4.75) due to the additional polar groups, but still in the same range due to the similar overall molecular framework.

Iteration: 5
SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 1.5460571391309497
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1) The molecule contains:
   - Two fluorine atoms on a benzene ring
   - A urea linkage (-NC(=O)NC(=O)-)
   - A chlorine atom on another benzene ring
   - Overall, it's a relatively complex structure with both polar and nonpolar regions

2) Looking at similar structures in the training set:
   - Molecules with halogen substitutions (F, Cl) generally have values between 0.3 and 1.2
   - Urea-containing structures tend to have negative values (e.g., CC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O at -0.84805793)
   - The presence of multiple halogens typically increases the value
   - Amide/urea groups tend to decrease the value

3) Considering these factors:
   - The molecule has some structural similarity to urea compounds
   - It has multiple halogens (2F, 1Cl) which would increase the value
   - The overall polarity and size would suggest a moderate value

Based on these considerations, I would predict a property value of approximately -0.45

This prediction takes into account the competing effects of the halogen substituents (which tend to increase the value) and the urea linkage (which tends to decrease the value), resulting in a slightly negative value.
==================================================
Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.3446774870425529
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCOC(C)C - propyl isopropyl ether) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with similar oxygen-containing aliphatic structures tend to have negative values
2. The length of alkyl chains affects the value (longer chains generally increase the value)
3. Branching patterns and the presence of ethers typically reduce the value compared to pure hydrocarbons
4. Similar molecules like CCOC(=O)CC (-0.70602582) and CC1CCCO1 (-0.6308908) have negative values
5. Simple alcohols like CCCCCO (-0.63674738) also show negative values

Given that CCCOC(C)C is:
- A medium-sized ether
- Has both straight and branched chains
- Contains one oxygen atom
- Is relatively simple aliphatic structure
- Has similar structural elements to some of the negative-valued examples

I predict the property value would be approximately: -0.45

This prediction takes into account that it's less polar than some of the strongly negative examples but maintains the general characteristic of oxygen-containing aliphatic compounds in the training set.

Iteration: 7
SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: -0.4688586215021675
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the target molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O:

1. It contains a heterocyclic ring structure with nitrogen atoms
2. Has a bromine substituent
3. Contains carbonyl groups (C=O)
4. Has alkyl substituents (ethyl and methyl groups)
5. Contains an NH group

Analyzing similar structures from the training set:
- Molecules with heterocycles typically have values close to 0 or slightly negative
- Bromine-containing compounds like CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 have values around 0.05
- The presence of carbonyl groups tends to decrease the value
- The alkyl substituents slightly increase the value
- NH groups tend to decrease the value

Taking all these structural features into account and comparing with the patterns in the training set, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.12

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has features that would both increase the value (bromine, alkyl groups) and decrease it (heterocycle, NH, C=O), resulting in a value slightly above zero but not dramatically so.
==================================================
Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 1.1581808618796985
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The molecule "c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2" is biphenyl - two benzene rings connected directly to each other.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have values between 0 and 1
2. Molecules with fused aromatic rings tend to have higher values
3. More complex PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) have much higher values
4. Presence of polar groups (like -OH, -NO2, -NH2) tends to decrease the values
5. The size and complexity of the molecule generally correlates with higher values

For biphenyl:
- It's a relatively simple aromatic hydrocarbon
- It has two benzene rings, but they're not fused (unlike naphthalene)
- It has no polar substituents
- It's larger than benzene but smaller than most PAHs in the examples
- Similar structures in the training set tend to have values around 0.8-1.5

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict the property value for biphenyl to be approximately:

0.94

This prediction takes into account that it's a purely hydrocarbon structure, has some aromatic character, but is relatively simple compared to many of the examples shown.

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.4009544961479699
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule (CCCCS) and make a prediction based on the training examples provided.

CCCCS is butanethiol, a relatively simple aliphatic molecule with a sulfur group.

Looking at patterns in the training data:
1. Simple aliphatic molecules tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. Longer chain alkanes tend to have slightly positive values
3. Molecules with sulfur often have slightly negative to moderate positive values
4. The molecule is similar in size and complexity to molecules like CCCCCC(C)C (0.95994825) but with S instead of C
5. It's simpler than most molecules in the training set
6. The presence of sulfur might reduce the value somewhat compared to pure hydrocarbons

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.15

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's a relatively simple molecule (pushing towards moderate values)
- It has a moderate carbon chain length (pushing slightly positive)
- The sulfur group would likely reduce the value somewhat compared to pure hydrocarbons
- It's less complex than most highly positive examples in the training set

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.3537277109374235
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns I observe in the training examples.

CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with:
- A primary alcohol group (-OH)
- Two methyl branches
- A butyl chain backbone

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCCC(C)(C)C (branched alkane) has value 0.08481283
- CCCC(C)(O)CC (branched alcohol) has value -0.2715914
- CC(C)CC(C)O (branched alcohol) has value -0.54228046

Key observations:
1. Adding OH groups tends to decrease the value
2. Branched structures with similar carbon counts tend to have values between -0.5 and 0.1
3. This molecule is most similar to CCCC(C)(O)CC in terms of structure and functionality

Based on these patterns, and considering that this molecule:
- Has a primary alcohol (more polar than secondary)
- Has similar branching to the examples
- Has similar carbon count to the reference molecules

I predict the property value would be approximately: -0.31

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Lower than the pure alkane version
- Similar to but slightly higher than CC(C)CC(C)O
- Close to but slightly more negative than CCCC(C)(O)CC due to the primary alcohol

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.8548336723726759
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule "Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1" (methylnaphthalene), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1. This molecule is structurally similar to several examples in the training set, particularly:
- "Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1" (3.27006072) - a larger polycyclic aromatic
- "Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12" (1.32720293) - dimethylnaphthalene
- Basic naphthalene structure with single methyl substitution

2. Key structural features:
- Contains a naphthalene core (two fused benzene rings)
- Has one methyl substituent
- Simpler than the anthracene derivatives but larger than single-ring aromatics

3. Pattern analysis:
- Simple benzene (c1ccccc1) has value -0.41613796
- Adding methyl groups generally increases the value
- Fused ring systems tend to have higher values
- The value increases with size but not as much as highly substituted systems

Based on these observations, and particularly comparing it to the dimethylnaphthalene example (which has an extra methyl group), I would predict the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 to be approximately:

1.05 ± 0.15

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Higher than benzene (-0.41613796)
- Lower than dimethylnaphthalene (1.32720293)
- Significantly lower than the anthracene derivative (3.27006072)
- In line with the general trend of methylated polycyclic aromatics

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: -0.5678407562627129
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The target molecule is a barbiturate derivative with:
- A barbituric acid core (cyclic structure with three N-C=O groups)
- An alkyl substituent (C(C)CCC)
- A CC=C group

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a value of -0.93267329
- This is the most similar structure, differing only by having a longer alkyl chain

Key observations:
1. The core structure is identical to the example molecule
2. Both have a CC=C group
3. The main difference is the alkyl chain length
4. Generally, longer alkyl chains tend to increase the property value slightly

Given these considerations, I would predict the property value to be approximately -0.85

This prediction is based on:
- Starting from -0.93267329 (the similar example)
- Adjusting slightly upward due to the longer alkyl chain
- Maintaining the general negative value due to the barbiturate core structure

Therefore, my predicted value is: -0.85

Iteration: 13
SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.32929308105682087
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which contains:
- A benzene ring
- A CF3 (trifluoromethyl) group

Looking at patterns in the training data:
1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values between -0.5 and 1.0
2. Halogenated compounds (with Cl, Br) tend to increase the value
3. The size and complexity of the molecule affects the value
4. Highly halogenated compounds tend to have higher values

For this specific molecule:
- It's relatively small and simple
- Contains three fluorine atoms
- Has one aromatic ring
- Similar in size to some mono-substituted benzenes in the training set
- The CF3 group would contribute to lipophilicity but less than larger halogens

Based on these considerations and comparing to similar structures in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.35

This takes into account that it's a small aromatic molecule (like some in the -0.5 to 0.5 range) but with the addition of three fluorine atoms which would increase the value somewhat, though not as dramatically as multiple chlorines or larger structures would.

Iteration: 14
SMILES: OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -1.1300154318033022
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, I can make several observations:

1. This is a cyclic sugar-like molecule (a monosaccharide) with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups
2. It's highly polar due to multiple oxygen atoms and hydroxyl groups
3. It's structurally similar to OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO (which has a value of -1.13569008)
4. Both molecules are highly hydroxylated carbohydrates

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
- Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups tend to have negative values
- More polar molecules generally have more negative values
- Cyclic sugars and similar structures tend to have values around -1
- The presence of multiple oxygen atoms contributes to more negative values

Given these observations and the structural similarity to the reference molecule OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO (-1.13569008), I would predict the property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O to be approximately:

-1.15

This prediction is based on the molecule having similar polarity and hydroxyl group content to the reference sugar molecule, with slight adjustment for its cyclic nature.

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C, I notice:

1. It's a complex steroid-like structure (similar to some examples given)
2. Contains multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ketones, hydroxyl groups)
3. Has a complex polycyclic system
4. Contains ester group
5. Similar structural elements to CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C (which has value 5.24248524)
6. Also shares similarities with CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C (which has value 3.17385682)

Given these observations, especially its similarity to the steroid-like structures in the training set, but noting it has additional polar groups (more oxygen atoms), I would predict the property value to be:

4.18

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's likely to have a high value due to its complex steroid structure
- The additional oxygen-containing groups would slightly lower the value compared to the most similar example
- The presence of unsaturation and the ester group would modify the property somewhat

Iteration: 16
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 2.345904540854932
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples.

The target molecule (CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O) appears to be a steroid-like structure with:
- A basic steroid skeleton
- An oxygen (hydroxyl group)
- A ketone group
- Multiple ring systems
- Mostly saturated carbons

Looking at the training examples:
1. Complex polycyclic structures tend to have moderate positive values
2. The presence of hydroxyl groups (-OH) tends to slightly decrease the value
3. Molecules with similar complexity and functional groups like CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O have values around 1.6

Given these patterns and considering:
- The structural similarity to other steroid-like molecules in the training set
- The presence of both ketone and hydroxyl groups
- The overall molecular complexity and size

I predict the property value to be approximately 1.45

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has similar features to the steroid example in the training set (which had a value of 1.60039044) but with slightly different functionalization that would likely result in a somewhat lower value.

True Property: -0.4806560122607737
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (acetamido-nitrobenzene or 4-nitroacetanilide) and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the structural features:
1. It has an acetamido group (-NHCOCH3)
2. It has a nitro group (-NO2)
3. These groups are para to each other on a benzene ring
4. The molecule has both electron-withdrawing groups (NO2) and a moderately electron-donating group (NHCOCH3)

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (nitrobenzene) has a value of -0.46116459
- Other molecules with NO2 groups tend to have values between -0.8 and 0.4
- The addition of the acetamido group would likely make it slightly more negative

Based on these observations and the general trends in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.52

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is more polar than simple nitrobenzene due to the acetamido group, but maintains similar structural characteristics to other aromatic compounds with nitro substituents in the training set.

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, I notice:

1. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S)
2. Has a chlorinated benzene ring
3. Contains a heterocyclic system
4. Has multiple oxygen and sulfur atoms
5. Contains ethoxy groups (OCC)

Analyzing patterns from the training examples:
- Molecules with chlorine atoms typically have positive values
- Complex heterocyclic structures tend to have values between 0 and 2
- Larger, more complex molecules generally have higher values
- Presence of multiple heteroatoms (O, S, N) tends to moderate the value

Given these considerations and the structural complexity of the molecule, I would predict a property value of approximately 1.45

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of the chlorine atom (contributing positive value)
- The complex heterocyclic system
- The phosphorothioate group
- The overall size and complexity of the molecule
- The presence of multiple heteroatoms

Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the given examples.

CC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with a tertiary carbon center and a primary alcohol group. Looking at similar structures in the training examples:

1. CC(C)CO (isopropanol) has a value of -0.79564301
2. CCCCC(CC)CO (2-ethylhexanol) has a value of -0.10837014
3. CCCC(O)CCC (4-heptanol) has a value of -0.2715914
4. Simple alcohols generally show negative values
5. Branching tends to make the values less negative compared to linear chains

Based on these observations, and considering that:
- It's a relatively small molecule (like isopropanol)
- Has more branching than isopropanol
- Contains a primary alcohol group
- Has a compact structure

I would predict a value of approximately -0.65 for CC(C)(C)CO.

This prediction takes into account that it should be:

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples.

The molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is hypoxanthine, which has several key characteristics:
1. It's a purine derivative
2. Contains multiple nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic rings
3. Has two NH groups
4. Contains a carbonyl group
5. Is relatively polar
6. Has a bicyclic structure

Looking at the training examples:

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.8117550263559526
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, a relatively simple ester.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Small molecules generally have negative values
2. Molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups (especially esters) tend to have negative values
3. Similar simple esters in the training set have values around -0.3 to -0.6
4. The presence of branching (isopropyl group) tends to make values slightly less negative
5. Short chain esters and alcohols like CC(C)O (isopropanol) have values around -0.85

Given these observations and considering:
- The molecule's small size
- The presence of an ester group
- The branched isopropyl structure
- Similarity to other simple oxygenated compounds in the dataset

I predict the property value for CC(C)OC=O to be approximately: -0.52

This prediction takes into account that it should be negative (like most small oxygenated molecules), but slightly less negative than isopropanol due to the ester group and similar to other simple esters in the dataset.

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings generally have values between -0.5 and 1.5
2. Molecules containing amide/urea groups tend to have slightly negative values
3. The presence of two phenyl rings typically increases the value
4. Molecules with similar polar groups (C=O, NH) tend to have negative to slightly positive values
5. Similar structures like C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1 have a value of -0.853814

Given that this molecule:
- Has two phenyl rings (pushing value up)
- Contains a urea linkage (pulling value down)
- Has similar polarity to several training examples
- Is relatively symmetric
- Has structural similarity to some amide/urea compounds in the training set

I would predict a property value of approximately -0.15

This prediction takes into account both the aromatic character that tends to increase the value and the polar urea group that tends to decrease it, resulting in a moderate negative value.

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 1.0113732744412758
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the target molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (which is fluorene), I can make the following observations:

1. The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with three fused rings
2. It's similar in structure to some of the other PAHs in the training set
3. Looking at similar structures in the examples:
   - c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 (pentacene) has a value of 6.73316002
   - Simpler aromatics like CCCc1ccccc1 have lower values around 0.2634321
   - The property appears to increase with more fused aromatic rings

The target molecule fluorene has:
- Three fused rings (two benzene rings connected by a five-membered ring)
- Is more compact than pentacene
- Has more rings than simple aromatics but fewer than pentacene

Based on these patterns and the structure-property relationships evident in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately 2.8 for this molecule. This value would place it between simple aromatic compounds and larger PAH systems, which aligns with its structural complexity.

Therefore, my predicted property value for C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 is 2.8

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -0.9966790268352467
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, I notice:
1. It contains a sulfonamide group -S(=O)(=O)-
2. Has multiple amino groups (-NH2)
3. Contains a para-substituted benzene ring
4. Has polar groups and is likely to have good water solubility
5. Is relatively small compared to many of the training examples
6. Contains no halogens or long alkyl chains that would increase the value significantly

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with polar groups and amino substituents tend to have negative values
- Aromatic compounds with polar substituents generally have values between -1 and 1
- The presence of sulfonamide groups tends to decrease the value
- Para-substituted benzenes without heavy halogens or long alkyl chains typically have moderate values

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.72

This prediction takes into account the molecule's polarity, size, and structural features while comparing it to similar compounds in the training set.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 2.2632794985185316
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1) The molecule contains:
- Triflurormethyl group (CF3)
- Two nitro groups (NO2)
- A tertiary amine with ethyl groups
- An alkene group
- A substituted benzene ring

2) Looking at patterns in the training examples:
- Molecules with NO2 groups tend to have values around -0.5 to 0.7
- Highly fluorinated compounds often increase the value
- Tertiary amines typically contribute positively
- Multiple electron-withdrawing groups tend to increase the value
- Aromatic systems with multiple substituents generally have higher values

3) Similar molecules from the training set:
- Nitro-containing aromatics like "Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O" has -0.58788541
- But this molecule has additional electron-withdrawing groups and is more complex

Considering all these factors, especially the presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups (NO2 and CF3), the tertiary amine, and the overall molecular complexity, I would predict a value of approximately:

1.23

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a higher value than simple nitro-aromatics due to its additional functionalization, but lower than highly lipophilic polycyclic compounds seen in the training set.
==================================================
Iteration: 26
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.8117550263559526
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (isopropyl formate, CC(C)OC=O) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a small ester molecule
2. Has branching (isopropyl group)
3. Contains a formate group (OC=O)
4. Similar in size and functionality to some training examples

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- CC(C)CCOC=O (isoamyl formate) has a value of -0.6235863
- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 (ethyl 4-aminobenzoate) has -0.52861473
- Simple esters and oxygenated compounds generally show negative values
- Shorter chain esters tend to have more negative values than longer ones

The target molecule is smaller than CC(C)CCOC=O but has similar functionality. It should have a slightly more negative value due to its smaller size but similar chemical nature.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for CC(C)OC=O to be approximately:

-0.68

This prediction takes into account that smaller molecules with oxygen-containing groups tend to have more negative values in this dataset, while maintaining consistency with the general trends observed in the training examples.
==================================================
Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.23356783435688164
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethylphenol (two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group on a benzene ring).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple phenols like c1ccccc1O have values around -0.55
2. Adding methyl groups to aromatic rings tends to increase the value slightly
3. The molecule is relatively small and has some similarity to methylaniline (Cc1cccc(N)c1) which has a value of -0.47
4. It's more hydrophobic than simple phenol due to the methyl groups
5. The hydroxyl group contributes to polarity and hydrogen bonding

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.32

This prediction takes into account that:
- The base phenol structure typically gives negative values
- The two methyl groups would make it slightly less negative than simple phenol
- The molecule maintains some polarity due to the hydroxyl group
- It's more hydrophobic than simple phenol but less than highly chlorinated or complex structures

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 1.6076035119145027
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, I notice:

1. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)(OC)O-) similar to several examples like COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (4.06518157)

2. The aromatic ring substitution pattern is different from the examples, but it has:
- A methylthio group (SC)
- A methyl group (C)
- Less halogen substitution compared to similar phosphorothioate compounds

3. Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl = 4.06518157
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl = 3.8937364
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl = 4.46982323

The target molecule should have a slightly lower value than these examples because:
- It lacks the electron-withdrawing halogens
- The methylthio and methyl groups are less electronegative
- The overall molecular weight is lower

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value to be approximately:

2.85

This value reflects that the molecule should have a positive value due to its phosphorothioate group, but lower than the halogenated analogs in the training set.

Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 20.47795401682006
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples.

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has several key characteristics:
1. It contains multiple chlorine atoms (5 Cl atoms)
2. It has a biphenyl-like structure (two benzene rings connected)
3. The chlorines are distributed across both rings
4. It's a relatively large, planar aromatic system

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with multiple chlorines tend to have higher values
- Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) like Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl have very high values (32.67)
- However, the target molecule has fewer chlorines than some of the highest-value examples
- The arrangement is somewhat different from the highest-value PCBs in the training set

Based on these observations and the general trends in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately:

8.5

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a relatively high value due to its PCB-like structure and multiple chlorines, but lower than the most heavily chlorinated examples in the training set.
==================================================
Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7860562002335568
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O, propyl nitrite) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. It has a short carbon chain (3 carbons)
3. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - Simple alkanes (CCC) tend to have negative values around -0.5
   - Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to decrease the value
   - Small molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups often have negative values
   - The closest analogues in the training set suggest this should have a moderately negative value

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict the property value for CCCN(=O)=O to be approximately:

-0.48

This prediction takes into account:
- The small size of the molecule
- The presence of the nitro group
- The short alkyl chain
- The overall polarity of the molecule
- Patterns seen in similar structures from the training set

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.21485805104541372
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided.

The target molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a benzene ring substituted with fluorine and bromine in different positions.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of 0.79291214 (similar dihalogen substitution)
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 appears in variations with values around 0-0.8
- Bromine-containing aromatics tend to increase the value
- Fluorine substitutions generally have slightly lower values than chlorine

The target molecule is most similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (0.79291214), but with F instead of Cl and a different substitution pattern. Fluorine typically leads to slightly lower values than chlorine in similar structures.

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict a value of approximately 0.65 for Fc1cccc(Br)c1.

This prediction takes into account:
1. The presence of two halogens on the benzene ring
2. The relative effects of F vs Cl
3. The meta substitution pattern
4. The general range of values for similar halogenated aromatics in the training set

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.10951612081830257
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The target molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic structure with:
- Two connected rings
- Multiple methyl groups (C)
- One hydroxyl group (OH)
- Mostly saturated carbons

2. Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
- Molecules with ring structures tend to have moderate values
- Presence of OH groups often leads to slightly negative values
- Bicyclic structures without aromatics tend to have values closer to zero
- The complexity is moderate (not as complex as steroid-like structures that show higher values)

3. Most similar examples from the training set:
- CC1CCCO1 (-0.6308908)
- CC(C)(C)CO (-0.68547686)
- Simple ring structures with OH groups tend to be in the -0.3 to -0.7 range

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account the bicyclic nature, the presence of the OH group, and the overall molecular complexity while staying within the range of similar structures from the training set.

Iteration: 33
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.20728302149623826
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and my understanding of molecular structures.

Looking at the test molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, I notice:

1. It's structurally similar to CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O from the training set (which has a value of 2.15734629)
2. The main difference is the absence of SC(CCl) group in the test molecule
3. It contains:
   - A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
   - A phthalimide ring system
   - Ethoxy groups (OCC)
4. The molecule has moderate complexity and some lipophilic character

Considering these factors:
- The removal of SC(CCl) group would reduce the lipophilicity somewhat
- The core structure remains similar to the training example
- The presence of P=S and phthalimide groups suggests moderate polarity

Based on these considerations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

1.85

This value is slightly lower than the similar training molecule (2.15734629) due to the reduced lipophilicity from the missing SC(CCl) group, while maintaining the core structural features that contribute to the property.

Iteration: 34
SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -0.5116900516231622
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The target molecule is a heterocyclic compound containing a pyrazolone ring with phenyl and methyl substituents.

2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- It has some similarity to "Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O" (0.66409181)
- Contains N-phenyl substituent like "CNc1ccccc1" (-0.39473171)
- Has a cyclic structure with carbonyl group

3. Key observations:
- The molecule is relatively small to medium-sized
- Contains both aromatic and heterocyclic components
- Has a carbonyl group
- Contains N-N linkage
- Has methyl substituents

4. Analyzing the training set patterns:
- Molecules with similar size and complexity tend to have values between -0.5 and 1.0
- N-containing heterocycles generally show moderate values
- The presence of carbonyl groups often leads to slightly negative to moderate positive values

Based on these considerations and the structural similarities to the training examples, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.15 to 0.25, with my best single prediction being 0.19

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate size, presence of both aromatic and heterocyclic components, and structural similarity to known examples while considering the general trends observed in the training set.
==================================================
Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.15413595076233744
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCC(=O)OCC - ethyl hexanoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Longer chain esters tend to have values around 0 to 1
2. The presence of C(=O)O (ester group) typically reduces the value compared to pure hydrocarbons
3. Similar compounds like CCCCCCCI (1.21945678) and CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (0.55243758) provide good reference points
4. Simpler esters like COC=O have much lower values (-0.95382574)
5. The length of the carbon chain tends to increase the value

For CCCCCC(=O)OCC:
- It's a medium-length ester
- Has a linear structure
- Contains 8 carbons total
- Has similar structural elements to CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC but is slightly shorter

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.12

This value takes into account that it should be:
- Higher than simple esters
- Lower than longer chain esters
- Lower than similar length alkyl halides
- Slightly positive due to the chain length
- Moderated by the ester group
==================================================
Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.5166154810444945
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples and my understanding of molecular structures.

The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is methyl benzoate, which consists of:
- A benzene ring (c1ccccc1)
- A carboxyl ester group (-C(=O)O-)
- A methyl group (-CH3)

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) has a value of -0.32108879
- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 (with an additional OH group) has a value of -0.47336498

The target molecule is very similar to ethyl benzoate, just with a methyl ester instead of an ethyl ester. Since methyl groups are slightly smaller than ethyl groups, and considering the general trend in the data where smaller molecules tend to have slightly lower values, I would predict the property value to be:

-0.35 to -0.40

My specific prediction would be: -0.37

This takes into account that:
1. It's structurally very similar to ethyl benzoate
2. The methyl group makes it slightly more polar than ethyl benzoate
3. The overall molecular size is smaller
4. There are no additional functional groups to significantly alter the property

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.38414059979473925
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (1,4-pentadiene) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have values close to zero or slightly negative
2. The presence of double bonds tends to make values slightly less negative compared to similar saturated compounds
3. Similar molecules in the training set:
   - CC/C=C/C (2-pentene) has a value of -0.25633754
   - C=Cc1ccccc1 (styrene) has a value of -0.00740945
   - C1CCCC1 (cyclopentane) has a value of -0.26977468

The target molecule C=CCC=C (1,4-pentadiene) has:
- Same carbon count as 2-pentene but with two double bonds
- No cyclic structure
- No functional groups
- More unsaturation than the similar examples

Based on these observations and the general trends in the data, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Slightly less negative than 2-pentene (-0.25633754) due to additional unsaturation
- More negative than styrene (-0.00740945) due to lack of aromatic ring
- In the general range of simple hydrocarbons seen in the training set

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.09521158786500165
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (tribromomethane/bromoform) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Halogenated compounds generally have positive values
2. Small molecules with multiple halogens tend to have values between 0 and 1
3. The complexity and size of the molecule affects the magnitude
4. Highly halogenated compounds (especially with Cl) tend to have higher values

For BrC(Br)Br (tribromomethane):
- It's a small molecule
- Contains three bromine atoms
- Similar in structure to some halogenated compounds in the training set
- Smaller than most aromatic bromine compounds shown

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for BrC(Br)Br to be approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account that it's a small molecule with multiple halogens, but not as complex as the larger aromatic systems that show higher values.

True Property: 2.1573462948917226
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule has several key structural features:
1. Organophosphate group (P=S)
2. Phthalimide ring system
3. Chloroethyl group
4. Ethoxy groups

Looking at the training examples:
- Molecules with P=S groups tend to have values around 3-4 (like the pesticide-like structures)
- Presence of chlorine typically increases the value
- Complex heterocyclic structures with multiple rings tend to have moderate positive values
- The combination of aromatic rings and heteroatoms typically results in values between 1-4

Considering these patterns and the overall molecular structure, which is relatively complex and contains both lipophilic and polar groups, I would predict a property value of approximately:

2.85

This prediction takes into account:
- The similarity to other organophosphate structures in the training set
- The presence of the phthalimide ring system
- The moderate size and complexity of the molecule
- The presence of both polar and non-polar regions
- The chlorine substituent effect

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains several key structural features:
- A urea linkage (N-C(=O)-N)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring
- A heterocyclic ring system with N-N and O
- A tert-butyl group
- N,N-dimethyl group

2. Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Molecules with N,N-dimethyl groups tend to have negative values (e.g., CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C at -0.88281757)
- Chlorinated aromatics generally contribute to positive values
- Complex heterocycles with multiple nitrogen atoms tend to have values around -0.5 to 0.5
- The presence of urea-like groups tends to decrease the value

3. Considering the size and complexity:
- The molecule is moderately sized
- Has both polar and non-polar regions
- Contains multiple functional groups

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.32

This prediction takes into account the competing effects of the various structural features, with the chloro and tert-butyl groups pushing the value up while the urea and heterocyclic portions moderate it downward.

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 6.725067698976103
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has:
- A diphenyl ether core structure
- Three chlorine substituents
- One hydroxyl group
- Multiple aromatic rings

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl has a value of 0.32280439 (similar but smaller)
- c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2 has a value of 2.46256745 (biphenyl with one Cl)
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 has a value of 4.5022484 (biphenyl with two Cl)
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a value of 2.45959785 (phenol with multiple Cl)

Given that:
1. The molecule has features similar to both chlorinated phenols and chlorinated biphenyls
2. The ether linkage typically reduces the value somewhat compared to direct biphenyl bonds
3. The presence of multiple chlorines tends to increase the value
4. The hydroxyl group slightly decreases the value

I predict the property value would be approximately: 2.15

This value takes into account the combined effects of the chlorine substituents, the ether linkage, and the hydroxyl group, placing it between the values seen for simpler chlorinated phenols and more complex chlorinated biphenyls.
==================================================
Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.25633754238105394
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to make a prediction.

The molecule CC/C=C\C is a pentene (C5H10) with a trans (E) configuration at the double bond, while one of the training examples CC/C=C/C is the same molecule but with a cis (Z) configuration, which had a value of -0.25633754.

Key observations:
1. The molecules are constitutional isomers (same molecular formula, different arrangement)
2. The only difference is the stereochemistry at the double bond
3. In general, trans isomers tend to be slightly more stable and have slightly different physical properties than their cis counterparts
4. The difference in properties between cis/trans isomers is usually relatively small

Given that the cis isomer has a value of -0.25633754, and considering that trans isomers typically have values close to but slightly different from their cis counterparts, I would predict the property value for CC/C=C\C to be approximately:

-0.23

This prediction takes into account that trans isomers often have slightly higher values than their cis counterparts for many physical properties, but the difference is usually small.

Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.5339980704427931
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns I observe in the training examples.

CCCOCC is a relatively simple aliphatic ether with:
- A linear carbon chain
- An oxygen atom in the middle
- No cyclic structures, aromatics, or other functional groups
- Similar in complexity to simple alcohols and alkanes in the training set

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- Simple alkanes like C (-0.7952979)
- Simple ethers tend to have values around -0.5 to 0
- Molecules with similar size and complexity like CC(C)O (-0.85176181)
- CCC#C (-0.68392983)

The molecule has:
- More carbons than methanol/ethanol which would increase the value
- An ether linkage which typically makes it slightly less polar than an alcohol
- A linear structure similar to simple alkanes

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict the property value for CCCOCC to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's more complex than the simplest molecules (which have values around -0.8)
2. It has an oxygen which typically reduces the value
3. It's less polar than alcohols
4. The linear structure and size puts it in a moderate range

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule has several key features:
1. Contains multiple aromatic rings (two phenyl groups)
2. Has a urea-like structure (N-C(=O)-N)
3. Contains tertiary butyl group
4. Has N-methylation
5. Is relatively medium-sized and has moderate complexity

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with aromatic rings typically have values between -0.5 and 1.5
- N-containing heterocycles and amides tend to pull values lower
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings tends to increase the value
- Molecules with similar size and complexity tend to have values around 0 to 1

Considering these factors and comparing to the most similar structures in the training set (especially those with N-containing functional groups and multiple aromatic rings), I would predict a value of approximately:

0.35

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has features that would both increase the property value (aromatic rings, bulky groups) and decrease it (polar urea-like group, N-methylation).

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.0554575484984593
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples and analyzing the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (N-acetyl-4-bromoaniline), I can make several observations:

1. It contains a bromine substituent on a benzene ring, similar to some examples
2. It has an acetamide group (-NH(C=O)CH3)
3. The structure has some polarity due to the amide group
4. It's relatively small compared to many of the examples

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.13692543) - has Br in para position
- Fc1cccc(Br)c1 (0.21485805) - has Br substituent
- Simple aromatic compounds with polar substituents tend to have values between -0.5 and 0.5

Considering these factors and the general trends in the data, I would predict the property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 to be approximately:

-0.28

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of the bromine (slightly increasing the value)
- The polar amide group (decreasing the value)
- The overall size and complexity of the molecule
- The similarity to other aromatic compounds in the dataset

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.5235820337487447
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns that can help predict the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 (isobutylbenzene):

1. The molecule contains a benzene ring with an isobutyl substituent
2. Similar compounds in the training set include:
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethyltoluene) = 0.18629492
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (p-cymene) = 0.81425416
- Cc1ccccc1 (toluene derivatives) show values around 0-0.5

The target molecule is:
- More branched than ethyltoluene but similar in size
- Similar to p-cymene but without the additional methyl group
- Has a longer/more flexible alkyl chain than simple toluene derivatives

Based on these structural comparisons and trends, I would predict the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 to be approximately 0.45

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The value should be positive (like other alkylbenzenes)
2. It should be higher than ethyltoluene but lower than p-cymene
3. The branching and flexibility of the alkyl chain typically increases the value moderately

Therefore, my final prediction is: 0.45

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.5051883638011577
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde) and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the patterns in the given examples:
1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values between -0.5 and 1.0
2. The presence of oxygen typically reduces the value
3. Aldehydes (-CHO group) generally contribute to a slightly negative value
4. Single-ring aromatics with simple substituents tend to have moderate values

Benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) has:
- A single benzene ring
- An aldehyde group (-CHO)
- Similar structural features to some simpler examples in the training set

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- COc1ccccc1 (anisole) has -0.41177309
- Simple benzene derivatives tend to be slightly negative to slightly positive
- The aldehyde group should make it slightly more negative than anisole

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to anisole while considering the slightly different electronic effects of an aldehyde group compared to a methoxy group.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.9104658395428563
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains a furan ring (5-membered oxygen heterocycle) with a nitro group
2. It has a cyclic urea structure (dihydropyrimidine-2,4-dione)
3. Contains a hydrazone linkage
4. Has multiple polar groups (C=O, NO2)
5. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
   - Contains nitrogen heterocycles (like some training examples)
   - Has similar polarity to some of the negative value compounds
   - Size and complexity is moderate
   - Contains both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups

Based on the patterns in the training data:
- Highly polar molecules with multiple heteroatoms tend to have lower values
- Molecules with similar size and complexity typically fall in the -1 to 1 range
- The presence of NO2 group typically increases the value slightly
- The combination of heterocycles and polar groups suggests a moderate negative value

Considering all these factors, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate size, polarity, and structural features similar to other compounds in the training set.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.8239558457211699
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally very similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training examples, which has a value of 2.705569. The only difference is that our target molecule has an NH linkage instead of a N=N linkage.

Key observations:
1. Both molecules have two phenyl rings
2. Both are connected by nitrogen atoms
3. The main difference is the saturation of the nitrogen bridge
4. The saturated version (our target) would be slightly less rigid and have slightly different electronic properties

Given that:
- The reduction of the double bond would slightly decrease the overall value
- The molecule maintains similar size and aromatic character
- The conjugation is slightly reduced

I would predict a value of approximately 2.45 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that the saturation of the N=N bond would slightly lower the property value compared to its unsaturated analog, but would still maintain most of the structural features that contribute to the property.

2. Contains a cyclopentane ring fused to the imide
3. Has multiple carbonyl groups (C=O)
4. Contains nitrogen atoms
5. Is relatively small and compact
6. Has some structural similarity to other cyclic compounds in the training set

- The presence of C=O and N atoms generally pushes towards negative values
- Similar sized cyclic structures show values around -0.6 to -0.9
- Compounds with multiple C=O groups often have negative values

Based on these observations and the structural features, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.71

This prediction takes into account the molecule's similarity to other cyclic nitrogen-containing compounds in the training set, its relatively small size, and the presence of multiple carbonyl groups, which tend to contribute to negative values in the observed examples.

True Property: 7.691715740216491
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the given examples. The target molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine substituents.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Molecules with multiple chlorines tend to have higher values
2. Biphenyl-like structures generally show increased values

4. The more complex chlorinated structure Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl had a very high value of 18.70326807

Given that this molecule:
- Has a biphenyl core structure
- Contains three chlorine substituents
- Is less chlorinated than the highest value example
- But more chlorinated than the dichlorobenzene example

I would predict a value of approximately 2.8 for this molecule. This places it between the simpler chlorinated aromatics and the more heavily chlorinated structures in the training set, while accounting for the biphenyl core and three chlorine substituents.

The predicted property value is: 2.8
==================================================
Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.4409993852779535
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 (diethylbenzene), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1. The molecule is a benzene ring with two ethyl groups in para position
2. It's a relatively non-polar, hydrophobic molecule
3. It's similar in structure to CCCCCCc1ccccc1 (which has value 2.00500114) but smaller
4. It has no functional groups that would significantly alter its properties
5. Looking at other aromatic compounds in the training set, simpler aromatics tend to have values between -0.5 and 2.0
6. The molecule is more hydrophobic than toluene (Cc1ccccc1N, -0.46946932) but less than the long-chain alkylbenzene

Based on these considerations and patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately:

- An aniline structure (Nc1ccc)
- A sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O)
- A para-substitution pattern

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a value of -0.63386301
- Other aromatic compounds with polar substituents tend to have negative values
- The presence of NH2 groups generally contributes to lower (more negative) values
- Sulfonamide groups, like nitro groups, are electron-withdrawing

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.71

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The molecule has similar polarity to the nitroaniline example
2. Sulfonamide groups have similar electronic effects to nitro groups
3. The presence of two NH2 groups would likely make it slightly more negative than the nitroaniline example
4. The molecule's size and overall polarity pattern matches with other negative-valued examples in the dataset

Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The target molecule (c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34) is pyrene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused benzene rings.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Molecules with multiple fused aromatic rings tend to have higher positive values
2. For example:
   - c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 (4 rings) → 8.58658747
   - c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 (5 rings) → 9.90710417
   - Simpler PAHs like naphthalene derivatives have lower but still positive values

The target molecule pyrene:
- Has 4 fused benzene rings
- Is fully aromatic
- Has no substituents
- Is structurally similar to but slightly smaller than the examples with high values

Based on these observations and the fact that pyrene is smaller than the 5-ring PAH example (9.90710417) but similar in size to the 4-ring example (8.58658747), I would predict a value of approximately:

7.85

This prediction takes into account that pyrene is a 4-ring system without substituents, placing it slightly lower than the substituted 4-ring system in the training set but still maintaining a high positive value characteristic of larger PAH systems.

2. The presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the value
3. Double bonds can affect the property
4. The molecule's size and complexity correlate with the magnitude of the value

4. Simpler dihalogenated structures tend to have lower values
5. The presence of bromine instead of chlorine typically increases the value slightly compared to chlorinated analogs

Considering these factors:
- This is a simple dihalogenated benzene, simpler than many examples
- Bromine substituents typically lead to slightly higher values than chlorine
- The para substitution pattern is symmetric
- The molecule lacks additional functional groups

Based on these considerations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

1.8

This value takes into account that it should be:
- Higher than simple dichlorobenzenes
- Lower than more complex polyaromatic halogenated structures
- In line with other simple halogenated aromatics in the training set

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 32.673069344878584
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and the target molecule, I notice this is likely predicting some kind of physical-chemical property. The target molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure, which is similar to some of the examples, particularly "Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" which has a value of 201.10451402.

Analyzing the patterns:
1. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings tend to have high positive values
2. The target molecule has 6 chlorine atoms (compared to 10 in the similar example)
3. It maintains the biphenyl core structure
4. It's slightly less chlorinated than the reference PCB

Based on these observations and the structure-property relationship apparent in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

120.5

This prediction takes into account that:
- The value should be positive and relatively high due to multiple chlorine substituents
- It should be lower than 201.10451402 since it has fewer chlorines
- The biphenyl core contribution should be similar
- The relationship between chlorine count and property value appears to be roughly proportional

True Property: 1.4272936174196433
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, I notice:

1. It contains a trifluoromethyl group (CF3)
2. Has a benzene ring
3. Contains a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring with a ketone
4. Has two chlorine atoms
5. Overall structure suggests moderate lipophilicity

Analyzing similar patterns from the training set:
- Molecules with halogen substituents (Cl, F) tend to increase the value
- Presence of aromatic rings generally contributes positively
- Nitrogen-containing heterocycles often moderate the value
- Ketone groups typically reduce the value slightly
- The combination of CF3 and Cl substituents suggests moderate lipophilicity

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has some lipophilic character (from CF3 and Cl groups) but also contains polar groups (ketone) that would moderate the overall value.

2. Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values around -0.5 to 0.5
- Nitro groups (NO2) appear in O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O which has a value of -0.50345007
- Methoxy groups (OCH3) generally don't drastically alter the value
- Single substituted benzenes typically have values in the -0.5 to 0.3 range

3. The molecule combines:
- A benzene ring (base)
- A methoxy group (slightly decreasing the value)
- A nitro group (typically decreasing the value)

4. Considering these factors and the similar structures in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has similar structural elements to the dinitrobenzene example but with only one nitro group and a methoxy group instead, which should result in a slightly less negative value than the dinitrobenzene example (-0.50345007).

Looking at similar molecules from the examples:
- ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl (hexachlorocyclohexane) has a value of 1.66757544
- Molecules with multiple chlorines tend to have positive values
- More complex and larger halogenated structures tend to have higher values
- The number of chlorine atoms and cyclic nature typically increases the value

Given the structural complexity, high number of chlorine atoms, and rigid cyclic system of the target molecule, I would predict a value between 2.0 and 3.0.

My specific prediction would be approximately: 2.45

This takes into account that it's more complex than hexachlorocyclohexane but has similar features to other highly chlorinated compounds in the training set.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 1.7574500239120163
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

This molecule is a linear ester with:
- A long alkyl chain (10 carbons)
- An ester group (-C(=O)O-)
- A short ethyl group at the end

Looking at the patterns in the training set:
1. Longer alkyl chains tend to increase the value
2. Esters generally have moderate values
3. Linear molecules with similar length like 'CCCCCCc1ccccc1' have values around 2.0
4. Oxygenated compounds tend to have lower values than pure hydrocarbons
5. The presence of the ester group typically reduces the value compared to pure alkanes

Considering these factors:
- The long alkyl chain will push the value up
- The ester group will moderate the value somewhat
- The overall linearity and length suggests a moderate positive value

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.85

This prediction takes into account the molecule's similarity to other long-chain compounds while accounting for the moderating effect of the ester group.

The target molecule has several key structural features:
1. A chlorinated aromatic ring
2. A hydroxyl group
3. An amide linkage
4. A nitro group
5. Multiple substituted benzene rings

Looking at similar structures in the training set:

Considering these factors and comparing to similar structures in the training set, particularly those with chlorinated aromatics and polar substituents, I would predict a property value of approximately:

2.8

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has features that would increase the property value (chlorinated aromatics) but also features that would decrease it (polar groups like OH and NO2), leading to a moderate positive value.

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set (especially compounds like COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 which has a value of 3.36332856), I would predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately:

3.85

This prediction takes into account the molecule's larger size, symmetry, and multiple phosphorothioate groups, which should result in a value higher than similar but smaller molecules in the training set.

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CCC#C is but-1-yne, a small alkyne with a linear structure.

Looking at the patterns in the given examples:
1. Small, simple molecules generally have values between -1 and 1
2. Molecules with triple bonds (C#N) tend to have slightly negative values
3. Short-chain aliphatic compounds typically have mildly negative values
4. The presence of unsaturation (like C#C) tends to slightly lower the value compared to fully saturated analogs

Considering these factors:
- It's a small molecule, so it should have a relatively small absolute value
- It has a triple bond, which tends to decrease the value
- It has a short carbon chain, similar to some of the simpler examples
- It lacks any functional groups that would dramatically affect the property

Based on these considerations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's small size, the presence of the triple bond, and its similarity to other simple hydrocarbons in the training set.

- c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 (0.41027161) - contains pyridine but is more complex
- Simple pyridine-containing structures generally show values around 0 to 0.5

4. Key considerations:
- The hydrazide group will likely reduce the value somewhat due to its polarity
- The structure is relatively simple

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 1.1791738941695231
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CCCCCCCC is n-octane, a straight-chain saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
- Longer chain hydrocarbons tend to have higher values
- Saturated hydrocarbons have moderate positive values
- Similar structures like CCCCCCCO (heptanol) has -0.27062295
- CCCC/C=C/C (heptene) has 0.37813981
- CCCCCC1CCCC1 (more complex hydrocarbon) has 1.89347908

The target molecule CCCCCCCC:
- Is longer than CCCCCCCO by one carbon
- Is fully saturated (no functional groups)
- Has no branching
- Is slightly more lipophilic than the shorter chain examples

Based on these observations and the trends in the training data, I would predict the property value for CCCCCCCC to be approximately:

0.65

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It should be higher than CCCC/C=C/C (0.37813981) due to being fully saturated
2. It should be higher than CCCCCCCO (-0.27062295) due to lacking the polar OH group
3. It should be lower than complex cyclic hydrocarbons like CCCCCC1CCCC1 (1.89347908)

True Property: 0.23298226440701186
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule appears to be a steroid-like structure with:
- A steroid core skeleton
- Two hydroxyl groups (O)
- One ketone group (=O)
- An alkyne group (C#C)

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
1. CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O (2.15961392) - Very similar steroid core
2. CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO (-0.30237904) - Similar but with more functional groups

The target molecule is most similar to example 1, but has some key differences:
- Additional hydroxyl group
- Terminal alkyne group
- Slightly different ring fusion pattern

Given these considerations:
- The additional polar groups (extra OH) would decrease the value somewhat compared to example 1
- The alkyne group would partially counteract this decrease
- The overall structure maintains the steroid core which contributes significantly to the property

Based on these factors, I predict the property value would be approximately:

1.85

This value is slightly lower than example 1 (2.15961392) due to increased polarity from the extra hydroxyl group, but still relatively high due to the maintained steroid core structure and the presence of the alkyne group.

- A moderate-sized fused ring system
- No halogens (which would have increased the value)

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

2.85

- The overall complexity is moderate

Based on these considerations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has moderate complexity, some polar character from the urethane group, but also lipophilic character from the chlorines and alkyne.

4. The molecule in question (butyl formate) is simpler than ethyl butyrate but has a similar structural pattern

Considering these factors:
- It's shorter than hexanal but has similar polarity due to the ester group
- It's simpler than ethyl butyrate but has the same number of carbons
- The formate ester (OC=O) typically contributes slightly differently than other esters

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value for CCCCOC=O to be approximately:

-0.52

This prediction takes into account that the value should be:
- Negative (like similar small esters)
- Slightly higher (less negative) than ethyl butyrate due to different ester arrangement
- Lower than hexanal due to the ester group instead of aldehyde

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.5388288850088547
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features.

Key observations:
1. The molecule is very similar to "ClCCCl" in the training set, which has a value of -0.52062604
2. It's a small, symmetric molecule with two chlorine atoms
3. It has one less carbon than ClCCCl
4. It's a simple halogenated hydrocarbon

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- ClCCCl: -0.52062604
- CCBr: -0.54733839
- Simple small molecules tend to have negative values in this property
- Halogenated compounds in this size range typically have values between -0.6 and -0.5

Given that ClCCl is smaller than ClCCCl but has the same number of chlorine atoms, I would expect its property value to be slightly more negative than ClCCCl, but in the same general range.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for ClCCl to be approximately:

-0.54

This prediction takes into account the molecule's similarity to ClCCCl while accounting for its smaller size and maintaining consistency with the general trends observed in the training set.

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.23356783435688164
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and molecular structure patterns.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a dimethylphenol (two methyl groups on a phenol ring).

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (methylated phenol) has value 0.45484656
- Oc1cccc(O)c1 (dihydroxybenzene) has value -0.66139132
- Simple phenols tend to have values between -0.7 and 0.5
- Adding methyl groups tends to increase the value slightly
- The position of substituents affects the value

Given that:
1. The structure is similar to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O but with a slightly different substitution pattern
2. It has one hydroxyl group like the reference compound
3. It has two methyl groups in different positions
4. The overall molecular size and complexity is similar

I predict the property value would be approximately 0.42

This prediction takes into account that:
- The molecule is slightly less bulky than CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 12.679114310977564
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples and analyzing the given molecule, I notice several important patterns:

1. Molecules containing multiple chlorine atoms (especially on aromatic rings) tend to have higher positive values
2. The structure Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is similar to other polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the training set
3. Specifically, it's most similar to "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl" (value: 32.67) and "Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl" (value: 20.48)
4. The query molecule has 4 chlorines (less than the similar molecules which have 5-6 chlorines)
5. The chlorine substitution pattern is slightly different

Based on these observations:
- It should have a high positive value due to multiple chlorines on aromatic rings
- The value should be lower than 32.67 and 20.48 due to fewer chlorines
- The specific substitution pattern suggests a value in this range

I predict the property value to be approximately: 15.8

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has structural features similar to other highly positive valued molecules but with fewer chlorine substituents.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.25633754238105394
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (2-methylbut-2-ene) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice that:
1. Smaller, simpler molecules tend to have lower values
2. Molecules with double bonds tend to have slightly higher values than their saturated counterparts
3. Branched alkenes tend to have values around -0.5 to 1.0
4. The presence of methyl groups slightly increases the value

For CC=C(C)C:
- It's a small molecule (C5H10)
- Has one double bond
- Has branching (two methyl groups)
- Similar in size/structure to molecules like simple alkenes in the training set

Considering these factors and comparing to similar structures in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.15

This prediction takes into account that it's a relatively small branched alkene, slightly more complex than the simplest alkenes but less complex than larger hydrocarbons in the training set.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.5388288850088547
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (dichloromethane, CH2Cl2) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a very small molecule with just two carbons and two chlorines
2. Looking at similar small halogenated compounds in the training set:
   - ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a value of 0.74771271
   - Simple chlorinated compounds tend to have values between 0 and 1
3. This molecule is smaller and simpler than most examples
4. It has similar polarity characteristics to some of the smaller chlorinated compounds
5. It lacks aromatic rings or complex functional groups

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, particularly comparing to similar small halogenated molecules, I would predict the property value for ClCCl to be approximately:

0.28

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's smaller than tetrachloroethene (value ~0.75)
- It has fewer chlorines than many of the higher-valued chlorinated compounds
- Simple molecular structures tend to have lower values in the dataset
- The presence of chlorines typically contributes to a moderate positive value

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 1.1562817892890702
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule "Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl", I can make several observations:

1. This molecule is a tri-chlorinated phenol
2. It's similar in structure to "Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl" from the training set, which has a value of 1.15628179
3. The only difference is the position of one chlorine atom
4. Looking at other halogenated aromatics in the dataset:
   - "Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1" has a value of 2.38202747
   - Chlorinated compounds generally show positive values
   - More halogens tend to increase the value

Given these observations and the very close structural similarity to "Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl", I would predict the property value to be very close to 1.15628179, with only a minor variation due to the slightly different chlorine position.

My prediction for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl would be approximately 1.17

1. The given molecule is a complex natural product-like structure with:
- Multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters)
- A methylenedioxy group (OCO)
- Multiple rings including aromatic and aliphatic systems
- Several hydroxyl groups
- Complex stereochemistry

2. Looking at the training examples:
- Larger, more complex molecules tend to have values between -1 and 4
- Highly oxygenated molecules with sugar-like moieties tend to have negative values

- Natural product-like structures with multiple rings tend to have values around 0 to 2

3. Key observations from the target molecule:
- It has similarities to glycosides (sugar-containing compounds) which typically have negative values
- The complexity is balanced by the presence of polar groups
- The aromatic systems and multiple rings would contribute some positive value
- The overall polarity from the oxygen atoms would pull the value down

Based on these considerations and patterns from the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's structural complexity, the presence of multiple polar groups, and its similarity to natural product-like structures in the training set.

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A heterocyclic ring structure with nitrogen atoms
- A thioether group (CS-)
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.3210887912242995
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (ethyl benzoate) by comparing it to the training examples and looking for structural similarities and patterns.

Key observations:
1. It's an aromatic ester with a benzene ring
2. The size and complexity is moderate
3. Contains similar functional groups to several training examples
4. Has similar polarity characteristics to some molecules in the training set

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple esters like CCCC(=O)OC have values around -0.39
- Benzene-containing compounds generally increase the value
- The presence of C(=O)O group tends to decrease the value compared to pure hydrocarbons
- Similar sized molecules with aromatic rings and polar groups tend to have values between -0.4 and 0.5

Based on these patterns and considering the specific structural features of ethyl benzoate, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 1.155174716791866
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

CCCCCCCBr is a 1-bromoheptane, a straight-chain alkyl bromide.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple linear molecules tend to have values between -1 and 1
2. Halogenated compounds (especially brominated) tend to have slightly higher values than their non-halogenated counterparts
3. The example Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (bromonaphthalene) has a value of 1.58740927
4. Linear alkanes and their simple derivatives generally have values close to 0, slightly positive or negative
5. CCCCCCC=C (1-heptene) has a value of 0.84739141, which is structurally similar but with a double bond instead of Br

Given that:
- This is a simple linear molecule (suggesting moderate values)
- It contains a bromine (which tends to increase the value slightly)
- It's similar in length to the heptene example
- Bromine typically contributes more to the property than a double bond

I predict the value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately 0.95

This takes into account that it should be:
- Higher than simple alkanes
- Similar to but slightly higher than CCCCCCC=C
- Lower than more complex brominated aromatics

SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.9773098940872307
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (methanol - CO) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1) It's a very small molecule with just 2 atoms (C and O)
2) It contains a hydroxyl group (-OH) similar to other alcohols in the training set
3) Looking at similar small molecules in the training set:
   - CCC (propane) is -0.54101993
   - CC#C (propyne) is -0.79445839
   - Simple alcohols like CCC(C)CO have values around -0.68547686

4) The molecule is smaller than most examples, but follows the pattern where:
   - Oxygenated compounds tend to have more negative values
   - Smaller molecules generally have more negative values than larger ones
   - Simple alcohols consistently show negative values

Based on these patterns and considering methanol's small size and hydroxyl group, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.77

This prediction takes into account that methanol should:
- Have a more negative value than propane (-0.54) due to the OH group
- Be slightly more negative than larger alcohols
- Fall within the general range of small oxygenated molecules in the training set
