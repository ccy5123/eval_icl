SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -2071.5555858337034
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this as an experienced chemist. The molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane) is a simple halogenated hydrocarbon with two chlorine atoms attached to a single carbon atom.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Halogenated compounds tend to have relatively high negative values
2. The closest structural analog in the training set is ClCCCl (-1421.94854587)
3. ClCCl is smaller than ClCCCl by one carbon atom
4. The presence of chlorine atoms seems to contribute to more negative values

Given that ClCCl is structurally very similar to ClCCCl but with one less carbon atom, and considering the general patterns in the training data where similar halogenated compounds show comparable values, I would predict the property value for ClCCl to be approximately:

-1350.0

This prediction takes into account that:
- It should be in the same general range as ClCCCl
- The shorter carbon chain would likely make the absolute value slightly less negative
- The chlorine-to-carbon ratio is higher than in ClCCCl, which would influence the property

Based on these observations and the general trends in the dataset, I predict the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O to be approximately:

688.5

This prediction takes into account:
- The base phenol contribution
- The effect of two methyl substituents
- The specific substitution pattern
- The overall molecular size and complexity compared to similar structures in the training set

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -189.37688705175222
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure, similar to some molecules in the training set, particularly:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (185.28078933)
- Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (137.916088)

Key observations:
1. The target molecule has 4 chlorine atoms (like some training examples)
2. It has a biphenyl core structure
3. The chlorine substitution pattern is similar but not identical to the training examples
4. The property values for similar chlorinated aromatics tend to be in the range of 130-200

Based on these structural similarities and patterns in the training data, and considering the specific chlorine substitution pattern, I predict the property value to be approximately:

161.45

This prediction takes into account that the target molecule is slightly less chlorinated than some training examples but maintains similar structural features.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 799.0642724746111
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (2-methylbut-2-ene) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice that:
1. Smaller, simpler molecules tend to have values between 500-1000
2. Alkenes generally show positive values
3. Branched structures with methyl groups often contribute to positive values
4. The presence of C=C bonds typically results in moderate positive values

Given that CC=C(C)C is:
- A small molecule (5 carbons)
- Contains one double bond
- Has branching (two methyl groups)
- Similar in complexity to molecules like CCCCC(CC)C=O (898.31449369)
- Simpler than CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (324.93519743)
- More complex than simple alkenes like COC(=O)C=C (972.40643094)

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict the property value for CC=C(C)C to be approximately:

847.52

This prediction takes into account the molecule's size, branching pattern, and the presence of the double bond, while considering the general range of values seen in similar molecules from the training set.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -2071.5555858337034
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and the pattern in the training examples to predict the property value for ClCCl (dichloromethane).

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with chlorine atoms tend to have varying values
2. Small, symmetric molecules often have more extreme values
3. The presence of Cl-C-Cl pattern appears in several examples with generally positive values
4. Similar halogenated small molecules like ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a value of 1811.72664751

For ClCCl specifically:
- It's a very small molecule
- It has two chlorine atoms
- It's symmetric
- It's similar to but simpler than ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value for ClCCl to be approximately:

1450.2

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It should be a positive value (like most chlorinated compounds in the dataset)
2. It should be somewhat lower than ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl due to having fewer chlorine atoms
3. Its small size and symmetry suggest a relatively high value

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 1177.2439286707686
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms in specific positions.

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (very similar structure) has a value of 1117.13836037
2. Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 (trihalogenated benzene) has a value of 841.78131226
3. Other halogenated compounds show relatively high positive values

The target molecule is most similar to the first example, which is also a trichlorinated phenol. The only difference is the position of one chlorine atom. Since the electronic effects and overall structure are very similar, I would expect the property value to be close to 1117.13836037, but slightly different due to the changed position of one chlorine.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl to be approximately:

1108.5

This prediction takes into account the very similar structure to the first reference compound while allowing for slight variation due to the different substitution pattern.

2. Looking at the training examples, molecules with:
   - Multiple oxygen atoms tend to have negative values
   - Complex ring systems often contribute to negative values
   - Larger molecules with many substituents generally have more negative values
   - Natural product-like structures (similar to steroids) tend to have values around -1500 to -2000

The target molecule appears to be a natural product-like structure with:
- Multiple oxygen-containing functional groups
- Several fused ring systems
- Complex substitution patterns
- Similar structural features to some of the larger negative-valued examples

Based on these structural features and patterns in the training data, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-1750.42

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, size, and similarity to other natural product-like structures in the training set, while considering the general trend that oxygen-rich, complex molecules tend to have more negative values in this property scale.
