True Property: 0.5970641349456857
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (isopropyl formate, CC(C)OC=O) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with ester groups (OC=O) tend to have values around 0.1 to 0.3
2. Short-chain molecules with branching tend to have moderate values
3. The presence of oxygen atoms generally leads to slightly positive values

True Property: -1.1226690853760035
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethylphenol (specifically, a benzene ring with two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple phenols (like c1ccccc1O) have values around -0.04
2. Methylated aromatics tend to decrease the value slightly
3. The presence of hydroxyl groups (-OH) on aromatics generally leads to slightly negative values
4. The molecule's complexity and substitution pattern is relatively simple

Considering these factors:
- The base phenol structure would suggest a value near -0.04
- The two methyl groups would likely decrease this value somewhat
- The overall structure is similar to some of the simpler aromatic compounds in the training set

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I predict the property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 to be approximately:

-0.25

This prediction takes into account the structural similarities to other molecules in the training set and the general trends observed for similar functional groups and molecular patterns.

Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples.

The target molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has several key features:
1. It's an organophosphate structure (similar to several training examples)
2. Contains P=S group
3. Has methoxy groups (OC) attached to phosphorus
4. Has a phenyl ring with methyl and methylthio substituents

Looking at similar structures in the training set:

- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has value 0.79893555
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has value 0.87109458

These similar structures all have values in the range of 0.8-0.9. The main difference is that our target molecule has less electronegative substituents (SC and C instead of Cl, Br, or I). This would likely make the value slightly lower than these reference compounds.

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 to be approximately:

0.76

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a similar base value to other organophosphates but slightly lower due to the less electronegative substituents.

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 5 chlorine atoms.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl atoms) has value 1.64461406
2. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (7 Cl atoms) has value 1.77155333

The target molecule has:
- Similar biphenyl core structure
- 5 chlorine substituents (fewer than both reference molecules)
- Similar substitution pattern
- Similar molecular size and shape

Given that:
- The property values for similar PCBs are in the 1.6-1.8 range
- Our molecule has fewer chlorines than the reference molecules
- There appears to be a correlation between number of chlorines and property value
- The molecular size and core structure are very similar

I would predict a property value of approximately 1.52 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that the property value should be slightly lower than the 6-chloro analog (1.64) due to having one less chlorine, while maintaining the same general structural characteristics that lead to values in this range.

- Other halogenated aromatics show values typically between -0.2 and -0.6

Key considerations:
1. The molecule has two halogen substituents (F and Br)
2. They are in meta position to each other
3. Fluorine is generally more electronegative than chlorine
4. The overall molecular weight and size is similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately -0.31 for Fc1cccc(Br)c1.

This prediction takes into account that:
- The value should be similar to but slightly more negative than Clc1ccc(Br)cc1
- Fluorine typically has a stronger electronic effect than chlorine
- The meta substitution pattern might affect the property slightly differently than para substitution

- Cyclic imide structures generally contribute to moderate positive values
- The presence of ethoxy groups typically doesn't drastically alter the value
- Similar sized molecules in the training set tend to have values between 0.0 and 0.5

Considering these factors and comparing to the most similar structures in the training set (especially CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O which has a value of 0.45550747), I would predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately:

0.41

1) The target molecule is a heterocyclic compound containing:
- A pyrazolone ring system

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -1.5906298723332992
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCC(=O)OCC - ethyl hexanoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Longer chain esters tend to have negative values
2. Similar compounds like CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC have a value of -0.55548869
3. Simpler esters like COC=O have positive values (0.96939853)
4. The presence of C(=O)O group in medium-length chains tends to push values towards slightly negative territory
5. The length of this molecule (ethyl hexanoate) is intermediate between the simple and longer chain esters

Given these observations and considering:
- It's shorter than CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC but still a medium-length chain
- It has similar structural features to other esters in the dataset
- It's more complex than simple esters but less than the very long chain ones

I predict the property value would be approximately: -0.42

This value takes into account that it should be:

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (methyl benzoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) has a value of -0.74771194
2. COCC(=O)N... (other esters/similar fragments) tend to have negative values
3. Simple aromatic compounds with ester groups generally show negative values in this dataset

The query molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate) is very similar to ethyl benzoate, just having one carbon less in the ester group. Given that:
- It has the same core structure as ethyl benzoate
- It's slightly smaller (methyl vs ethyl)
- The general trend for similar compounds is in the negative range
- The methyl ester would likely have slightly different electronic properties than the ethyl ester

I would predict a value of approximately -0.70 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that methyl esters often have slightly different properties than their ethyl counterparts, but the overall structural similarity to the ethyl benzoate suggests the value should be in a similar range.

- Has two double bonds
- Has a linear structure
- Is similar to but slightly more unsaturated than CC/C=C/C
- Has no aromatic rings (unlike styrene)

I would predict a value around -1.5, specifically:

-1.48

This prediction takes into account that it should be more negative than the single double bond example (-1.01496402) due to additional unsaturation, but not as extreme as the styrene example (-4.92435414) since it lacks the aromatic ring.

- Chlorinated aromatics generally contribute to slightly positive values
- Complex heterocycles with multiple heteroatoms often lead to moderate positive values
- The presence of urea-like linkages tends to moderate extreme values

3. Considering the overall molecular size and complexity, which is similar to some of the more complex examples in the training set that showed values between 0.5 and 1.5

The target molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has:
- A phenoxy linkage between two aromatic rings
- Three chlorine substituents
- One hydroxyl group
- Similar structural elements to some training examples, particularly the chlorinated phenols

Looking at relevant examples from the training set:
- Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl (-1.02501967) - dichlorophenol
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (0.53676344) - tetrachlorophenol
- c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2 (0.53749772) - chlorinated biphenyl

The target molecule is more complex than a simple chlorophenol but less chlorinated than the tetrachlorophenol. It has a phenoxy bridge which would affect its properties differently than a direct biphenyl linkage.

Considering these structural features and the trends in the training data, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account:
1. The presence of multiple chlorines (tends to decrease the value)
2. The phenoxy linkage (moderates the effect)
3. The hydroxyl group (tends to increase the value slightly)
4. The overall size and complexity of the molecule

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -1.0149640211971238
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I notice this molecule is a geometric isomer (Z-isomer) of CC/C=C/C (E-isomer) which has a known property value of -1.01496402.

Given that this is the Z-isomer of 2-pentene (while the example was the E-isomer), and considering that Z-isomers typically have slightly different physical properties than their E-counterparts due to different spatial arrangements, I would predict the property value to be close to but slightly different from the E-isomer.

Based on the pattern in the training examples and my understanding of how geometric isomerism affects molecular properties, I would predict the property value for CC/C=C\C to be approximately:

-0.98

This prediction is slightly higher than the E-isomer because Z-isomers typically have slightly different properties due to their more compact spatial arrangement, but still very close to the E-isomer value since they are constitutional isomers with the same atoms and connectivity.

True Property: -0.6009015370260021
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, which is isobutylbenzene) by comparing it with the training examples and looking for structural similarities and patterns.

Key observations:
1. The molecule contains a benzene ring with an aliphatic branched chain
2. Similar structures in the training set include:
   - CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethyltoluene) with value -1.53261719
   - CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (p-cymene) with value -0.23843301
   - CC1CCCCC1 (methylcyclohexane) with value -1.40536612

The target molecule has:
- A benzene ring like many examples
- A branched alkyl substituent
- No polar groups
- Similar size and hydrophobicity to some training examples

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, particularly looking at similar aromatic compounds with alkyl substituents, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-1.15

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The molecule is slightly larger than ethyltoluene but has similar hydrophobicity
2. The branching pattern is similar to p-cymene but with an additional carbon
3. The value should be negative based on similar structures
4. The magnitude should be between the values seen for similar aromatic compounds

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.16580861116309184
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Aromatic rings generally contribute moderately to the property
2. Oxygen-containing functional groups, especially carbonyls, tend to have values around 0 to 0.6
3. Simple aromatic structures with single substituents typically have values in the -0.5 to 0.5 range
4. The aldehyde group (O=C-H) attached to benzene creates a relatively simple structure

Analyzing benzaldehyde specifically:
- It has a single aromatic ring (similar to many examples)
- Contains an aldehyde group
- Relatively small and simple structure
- Similar to some examples with oxygenated aromatics

Based on these observations and comparing to similar structures in the training set (especially considering molecules like COc1ccccc1 at -0.43787892 and NC(=O)c1ccccc1O at 0.64038984), I would predict the property value for benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) to be approximately:

0.15

This prediction takes into account that benzaldehyde is slightly more polar than methoxybenzene but less polar than salicylamide, and considers the overall structural patterns seen in the training set.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.8486009991116318
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains a furan ring (5-membered oxygen heterocycle) with a nitro group
2. It has a cyclic urea structure (hydantoin-like)
3. There's an imine linkage connecting these portions
4. The overall structure has several polar groups (C=O, NO2)
5. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - Molecules with heterocycles tend to have values around 0 to 1
   - Nitro-containing compounds often show positive values
   - The presence of multiple polar groups tends to moderate the value
   - Molecules with similar complexity and mixed functionalities typically fall in the -0.5 to 0.5 range

Based on these considerations and patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.31

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate polarity, presence of both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, and its overall structural complexity, while comparing it to the trends observed in the training set.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.22908638306419438
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally very similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training examples, which has a value of 0.59401467. The only difference is that our target molecule has an N-N single bond instead of an N=N double bond.

Looking at patterns in the training data:
1. The molecule has two phenyl rings connected by nitrogen atoms
2. It's a relatively planar structure
3. The overall size and complexity is moderate
4. The presence of aromatic rings tends to give values around 0-1 in many examples
5. The N-N single bond versus N=N double bond would likely make it slightly more polar

Given these considerations and the very close structural similarity to the azobenzene example (N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2), I would predict a value slightly different but close to 0.59401467.

My prediction for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be approximately 0.52

This prediction takes into account that the single bond would slightly alter the property but maintain a similar overall character to the azobenzene analog.

The target molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is a cyclic imide structure with a cyclopentane ring fused to it. Looking at the training examples:

1. It contains similar structural elements to O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC (0.15911332)
2. It has cyclic amide/imide groups like O=C1CCCN1 (0.92551097)
3. The overall size and complexity is moderate
4. It contains multiple C=O groups in a cyclic arrangement
5. It has a cyclopentane ring fusion which adds some rigidity to the structure

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.45

This prediction takes into account that:
- The molecule is relatively compact
- It has multiple polar groups (C=O, NH)
- It has a cyclic structure
- The property values for similar cyclic structures with multiple C=O groups tend to fall in this range
- The fusion with cyclopentane likely contributes to a moderate positive value

True Property: 1.1279135881234439
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has the following key features:
1. It contains three chlorine atoms
2. It has two benzene rings connected directly (biphenyl structure)
3. The chlorines are distributed between both rings
4. It's a relatively non-polar, aromatic compound

Looking at similar structures from the training set:
- Clc1ccccc1Cl (dichlorobenzene) has -0.41660317
- Other chlorinated aromatics tend to have values between -0.3 and 1.5
- Larger, more chlorinated structures like Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has 1.4693542

The target molecule is larger than dichlorobenzene but smaller than the pentachlorinated biphenyl derivative. It has three chlorines, which should place its value between these two examples.

Based on these structural comparisons and trends, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.48

This prediction takes into account the molecule's size, chlorine count, and aromatic character while considering the trends observed in the training set.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.7485238569551214
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a para-diethylbenzene (a benzene ring with two ethyl groups in para position).

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values between -0.4 and 0.4
2. The example CCCCCCc1ccccc1 (alkylbenzene) has a value of 0.40885567
3. Symmetric substitutions on benzene rings tend to give moderate positive values
4. The molecule is relatively simple and non-polar, suggesting a moderate value

Considering these factors, and noting that this molecule is smaller than CCCCCCc1ccccc1 but has symmetric ethyl groups, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.32

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's simpler than the heptylbenzene example but maintains similar chemical character
- The symmetric substitution pattern typically leads to moderate positive values
- The molecule lacks any polar functional groups that might drive the value significantly negative
- The size and complexity are in a middle range compared to the training set

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 0.9171943883927355
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and my understanding of molecular structures.

The target molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is sulfanilamide, which has:
- An aniline structure (aromatic ring with NH2)
- A sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2)
- A para-substitution pattern

Looking at the training examples:
1. Similar molecules with aniline structures (Nc1ccc...) tend to have values around 0.15-0.3
2. Molecules containing nitro groups (which are electronically similar to sulfonamide) often have values in the 0.2-0.7 range
3. Para-substituted aromatics in the dataset generally show moderate positive values

Considering these factors and the electronic effects of the sulfonamide group (which is electron-withdrawing like a nitro group but less strongly so), I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.22

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has similar electronic characteristics to p-nitroaniline (Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O) which has a value of 0.16617708 in the training set, but with a slightly more positive value due to the different electronic nature of the sulfonamide group compared to the nitro group.

2. Specifically:
   - The molecule "c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12" (methylated PAH) has value 1.17512216
   - "c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54" (larger PAH) has value 1.23424072
   - "Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32" (methylated PAH) has value 0.70336053

Pyrene is a compact, symmetric PAH structure. It's smaller than some of the example PAHs but has a similar conjugated system. Based on the pattern in the training data, where PAHs generally show positive values between 0.7 and 1.3, and considering pyrene's size and structure relative to the examples, I would predict:

Predicted value: 0.95

This prediction takes into account that pyrene is smaller than some of the example PAHs (which would reduce the value somewhat) but maintains the characteristic PAH structure that tends to give positive values in this property space.

- Oc1cccc(O)c1 (0.23359206) - phenol with different substitution
- c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC (-0.11285632) - phenol with different substitution

The target molecule is most similar to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, which has a value of -0.72168322. While they're not identical (the methyl group positions are different), they share key structural features:
- Both have a phenol core
- Both have methyl substituents
- Both have similar molecular weight and complexity

However, our target molecule has a slightly simpler structure and different substitution pattern, which should result in a slightly different but related value.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O to be approximately:

-0.65

This prediction takes into account the similarity to the closest matching structure while adjusting for the differences in substitution patterns and overall molecular complexity.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 1.3305898007997479
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 4 chlorine atoms. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl atoms) has value 1.64461406
2. Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (5 Cl atoms) has value 1.49962534
3. Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl (4 Cl atoms) has value 0.53676344

The target molecule has:
- Similar biphenyl core structure to examples 1 and 2
- 4 chlorine atoms (fewer than examples 1 and 2)
- No other functional groups

Based on these observations:
- The value should be positive (like other chlorinated aromatics)
- It should be lower than 1.64 and 1.50 (due to fewer Cl atoms)
- But higher than 0.54 (due to larger molecular size than example 3)

Considering these factors, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.35

This value reflects its intermediate position between the highly chlorinated biphenyls and simpler chlorinated aromatics in the training set.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -1.0149640211971238
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (2-methylbut-2-ene) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the given examples and the target molecule CC=C(C)C, I notice:

1. It's a relatively small hydrocarbon
2. Contains a double bond
3. Has branching methyl groups
4. Similar in size to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

Analyzing similar structures in the training set:
- Simple hydrocarbons tend to have values between -3 and 1
- Presence of double bonds seems to slightly increase the value
- Small, branched molecules often have slightly negative or near-zero values
- The molecule is similar in complexity to molecules like CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.23843301) but simpler

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict the property value for CC=C(C)C to be approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account the molecule's small size, presence of a double bond, and branching pattern, while considering the general range of values seen for similar simple organic molecules in the training set.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.07541612524712053
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a very small molecule with just two carbons
2. It has two chlorine atoms
3. It's symmetric
4. It's similar in size to some of the smaller molecules in the training set
5. Looking at other chlorinated compounds in the training set, they tend to have varying values
6. The molecule is similar in complexity to ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl which has a value of -0.30631443

Based on:
- Its small size
- The presence of two chlorines
- The symmetry of the molecule
- Comparison with similar molecules in the training set
- The general trend that simple chlorinated compounds in the dataset tend to have negative values but not extremely negative

I would predict a value of approximately -0.45 for ClCCl.

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is simpler than most in the training set, but has similar structural elements to some of the examples, particularly other chlorinated compounds.

Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.029203489184442787
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms at positions 2,4,6 and a hydroxyl group.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (2,4,6-trichlorophenol) has a value of 0.02920349
2. Other halogenated aromatics like Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 has a value of 0.51717232

The target molecule is exactly the same core structure as example #1 (Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl), just with a different arrangement of the chlorine atoms. Given that the electronic and steric effects would be very similar, and considering the property values seem to be influenced by both molecular size and substitution patterns, I would predict the value to be very close to the first example.

Therefore, I predict the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl to be approximately 0.03

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.013054140792928923
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains multiple key structural features:
- Multiple methoxy groups (OC)
- A phenol group (OH)
- Multiple ether linkages
- A lactone ring (COC=O)
- A methylenedioxy group (OCO)
- Multiple fused rings
- Several oxygen-containing substituents
- Complex stereochemistry

2. Looking at the training examples:
- Complex molecules with multiple oxygen-containing groups and fused rings tend to have values between 0 and 2
- Molecules with similar natural product-like structures (steroids, complex heterocycles) typically show values around 0.3 to 0.7
- The presence of multiple oxygen atoms and complex ring systems generally contributes to positive values

3. Considering the specific structural features:
- The molecule appears to be a lignin-type natural product derivative
- It has similarities to some of the more complex glycosides in the training set
- The combination of aromatic and aliphatic regions with multiple oxygen-containing substituents suggests a moderate positive value

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.84

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, oxygen content, and structural similarity to other complex natural product-like molecules in the training set.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.7044814712288847
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A heterocyclic ring with multiple nitrogen atoms
- A thioether (CS-) group
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)
- An amino substituent (-N)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Compounds with heterocyclic rings containing multiple N atoms tend to have values around 0.2 to 0.8
- The presence of sulfur-containing groups often contributes to slightly positive values
- Compounds with tert-butyl groups like CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C had a value of 0.29124095
- The carbonyl and amino groups typically moderate the value

Based on these structural features and their similarities to the training examples, particularly considering the similar heterocyclic system with nnc pattern and tert-butyl group, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.31

This prediction takes into account the balanced effect of the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups present in the molecule, as well as its similarity to other heterocyclic compounds in the training set.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.7477119363392154
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ethyl benzoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with ester groups (C(=O)O) tend to have slightly negative values
2. Simple aromatic systems with ester substituents show values around -0.5 to -0.7
3. The ethoxy group (CCOC) tends to make compounds less negative compared to methoxy
4. Single benzene ring with a single substituent typically gives moderate values

Considering these patterns and comparing specifically to similar structures like:
- CCCCC(=O)OCC (-0.51119474)
- CCCC(=O)CC (-0.55642224)
- Other aromatic esters in the dataset

I predict the property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 to be approximately:

-0.48

This prediction takes into account that it's a relatively simple aromatic ester, slightly less negative than aliphatic esters due to the benzene ring, but still maintaining the characteristic negative value typical for ester compounds in this dataset.

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.028498883904885614
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (1-bromoheptane, CCCCCCCBr) by comparing it with the given examples and looking for patterns in molecular structure and corresponding property values.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Longer alkyl chains tend to have values between -1 and 0
2. Halogenated compounds (especially brominated) tend to slightly increase the value
3. Simple linear structures generally have lower values than complex aromatics
4. The molecule is similar to CCCCCCC=C (-0.20703802) but with Br instead of =C
5. It's also similar to CCCCCCCO (-0.95151566) but with Br instead of OH
6. Comparing with Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (0.25399859), but our molecule is much simpler

Given these observations and patterns, and considering that:
- The bromine will increase the value somewhat compared to pure alkanes
- The linear chain will keep the value relatively low
- The length of the chain is similar to some examples with negative values

I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately:

-0.15

This takes into account the slightly negative tendency of long alkyl chains while accounting for the small positive contribution of the bromine atom.
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.039357704477799
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (methanol - CO) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Small molecules generally have values between -1 and 1
2. Alcohols (compounds with -OH groups) tend to have slightly positive or slightly negative values
3. Simple structures with few carbons typically have values closer to 0
4. The presence of oxygen typically shifts values slightly positive

Methanol (CO) is:
- A very simple alcohol
- One of the smallest organic molecules
- Has one oxygen and one carbon
- Similar in size to compounds like CCC (-0.06963563)
- Contains an alcohol group like CCC(C)CO (0.29201915)
- Simpler than most examples shown

Based on these observations and patterns, and considering methanol's small size and alcohol functionality, I predict the property value would be approximately:

0.15

This prediction takes into account that it's a small alcohol (pushing it positive) but simpler than most examples (moderating the value), placing it in a reasonable range based on the training data patterns.
