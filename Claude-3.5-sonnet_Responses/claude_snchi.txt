True Property: -0.9318941887606693
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (methyl decanoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Long chain esters tend to have moderate positive values
2. Similar molecule CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl dodecanoate) has a value of 0.46185898
3. The target molecule has a slightly shorter carbon chain
4. Molecules with ester groups (-C(=O)OC) generally show values in the range of -0.9 to 0.5

Considering these factors:
- The target molecule is very similar to methyl dodecanoate but with two fewer carbons in the chain
- The presence of the ester group and long alkyl chain suggests a moderate positive value
- The shorter chain length compared to methyl dodecanoate would likely result in a slightly lower value

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value to be approximately 0.42

This prediction takes into account both the structural similarity to known examples and the general trends observed in the dataset while considering the impact of chain length on the property value.

Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The target molecule (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) is biphenyl - two benzene rings connected directly to each other.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have values in the negative range
2. Simple conjugated aromatic systems often show moderate negative values
3. The most similar structures in the training set are molecules like:
   - C1CCc2ccccc2C1 (-0.76924328)

Key observations:
1. The molecule is relatively small and simple
2. It's an aliphatic chain with a sulfur terminal
3. Similar simple aliphatic structures in the training set tend to have values between -0.9 and 0.7
4. The presence of sulfur often shifts values higher compared to pure hydrocarbons

- The presence of sulfur (pushing towards slightly higher values)
- The chain length (medium-short)
- Similar structures in the training set

I would predict a property value of approximately: -0.45

This takes into account both the tendency of simple chains to have negative values while accounting for the sulfur's electron-donating effects that typically increase the value compared to pure hydrocarbons.

Looking at the molecule:
- It's an alcohol with a branched carbon chain
- Contains a primary alcohol group (-CH2OH)
- Has two methyl branches
- Overall structure is relatively simple and aliphatic

Analyzing similar structures from the examples:
- CCCC(C)(C)C (similar backbone) has value -0.72507978
- CCCC(C)(O)CC (similar structure with OH group) has value 0.60873843
- CC(C)CC(C)O (branched alcohol) has value 0.12868833

Key observations:
1. Molecules with alcohol groups tend to have moderate positive values

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.8855154927630721
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is methylnaphthalene, which consists of:
- A naphthalene core (two fused benzene rings)
- A methyl (CH3) substituent

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (dimethylnaphthalene): -0.10982664
2. c1ccccc1 (benzene): 0.09119022
3. Cc1cccc(C)c1C (trimethylbenzene): 0.83836583
4. Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (methylanthracene): -0.7353656

The target molecule is most structurally similar to the dimethylnaphthalene example, but with one less methyl group. It should have a property value between benzene and dimethylnaphthalene, but closer to dimethylnaphthalene due to the similar core structure.

Based on these comparisons and the observed patterns, I predict the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 to be approximately:

-0.05

This prediction takes into account that:
- It should be slightly more positive than dimethylnaphthalene (which is -0.10982664)
- But still negative due to the naphthalene core structure
- The presence of one methyl group instead of two would move it slightly toward zero

2. The most similar structure in the training set is "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C" with value -0.8369176
3. The main difference is that our target molecule has a longer alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) instead of just a methyl group

Key considerations:
- The core structure is very similar to the reference molecule
- The longer alkyl chain might slightly reduce the magnitude of the negative value
- The presence of CC=C group is maintained

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.79

This prediction is slightly less negative than the reference molecule (-0.8369176) due to the longer alkyl chain, but maintains the strong negative character due to the similar core structure and functional groups.

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Molecules with single benzene rings tend to have values in the moderate negative range
2. Halogen-containing compounds often show values between -0.5 and 0.8
3. Simple aromatic compounds with small substituents typically show values in the -0.4 to -0.6 range
4. The presence of fluorine atoms often shifts values compared to non-fluorinated analogs

Considering these factors and comparing to similar structures in the training set (like Clc1ccc(I)cc1 at -0.51480511), but accounting for the different electronic effects of the CF3 group, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account that the CF3 group is more electron-withdrawing than single halogens, but the overall molecular structure is still relatively simple and similar to other monosubstituted benzenes in the training set.

2. Most highly oxygenated molecules in the examples tend to have values between -0.1 and 0.2
3. Cyclic structures with multiple oxygen atoms generally show moderate positive values
4. The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups tends to moderate extreme values

Considering these patterns and the structural similarity to the known sugar molecule, while accounting for the cyclic nature of the target molecule, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.15 to 0.20

4. Generally, shorter chain esters tend to have slightly more negative values than their longer chain counterparts

Given these observations, I would predict the property value to be approximately -0.25 to -0.30, as it should be slightly more negative than ethyl benzoate due to the shorter chain length, but still in a similar range due to the shared core structure.

My specific prediction is: -0.27564

This takes into account both the structural similarity to ethyl benzoate and the general trends observed in the dataset regarding chain length effects on this property.

The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is isobutylbenzene, which consists of:
- A benzene ring (c1ccccc1)
- An isobutyl group (CC(C)C-) attached to the benzene ring

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethyltoluene) has a value of 0.49392036
- Cc1cccc2ccccc12 (methylnaphthalene) has a value of -0.89254907
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (p-cymene) has a value of -0.80420966

The target molecule is most similar to p-cymene (CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1), but with a CH₂ group inserted between the branched alkyl group and the benzene ring. This should make it slightly more positive in value compared to p-cymene, but not as positive as ethyltoluene.

Based on these structural relationships and the observed patterns, I predict the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 to be approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The additional CH₂ spacer typically makes the value more positive compared to direct ring substitution
2. Branched alkyl groups tend to push the value in a negative direction
3. The overall size and complexity of the molecule is moderate

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.9213541341480623
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Aromatic rings generally contribute to negative values
2. Simple oxygen-containing functional groups often lead to moderate negative values
3. The presence of an aldehyde group (C=O) tends to make the value less negative compared to alcohols
4. Single-ring aromatic compounds with simple substituents typically have values between -0.9 and -0.3

For benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1):
- It has a single benzene ring
- Contains an aldehyde group
- Structure is relatively simple
- Similar in complexity to compounds like COc1ccccc1 (-0.80806776)
- But aldehyde should make it slightly less negative than methoxy derivative

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.65

This value takes into account both the aromatic character and the electron-withdrawing effect of the aldehyde group, while staying within the general range observed for similar molecules in the training set.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.6609063455523181
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains a furan ring (5-membered oxygen heterocycle) with a nitro group
2. It has a cyclic urea structure (hydantoin-like)
3. There's a hydrazone linkage connecting these parts
4. The overall structure has several electron-withdrawing groups (nitro, carbonyl)
5. Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
   - Molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative values
   - Heterocyclic structures with multiple heteroatoms often have negative values
   - The presence of carbonyl groups in cyclic systems also tends to push toward negative values

Based on these structural features and patterns from the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately -0.45

This prediction takes into account:
- The electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group
- The presence of multiple heteroatoms
- The cyclic urea structure
- The conjugated system with the hydrazone linkage

This value represents a moderate negative property value, which aligns with the trends seen in similar molecules from the training set.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.8820094397084011
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally very similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training examples, which has a value of 0.69332608. The only difference is that our target molecule has an N-N single bond instead of an N=N double bond.

Looking at patterns in the training data:
1. Molecules with conjugated aromatic systems tend to have positive values
2. The presence of nitrogen atoms in aromatic systems generally contributes to positive values
3. The most structurally similar molecule has a value of ~0.69
4. The single bond vs double bond difference typically reduces the value slightly

Given these considerations and the very close structural similarity to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, but accounting for the reduced conjugation due to the single bond, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.65

This prediction takes into account that the single bond will slightly reduce the property value compared to the double-bonded analog, but the core structural features that contribute to the property are still present.

3. c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC (-0.78041833) - phenol with different substitution

Key observations:
- Molecules with hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings tend to have negative values
- The presence of methyl substituents on aromatic rings with hydroxyl groups tends to push the value more negative
- The most similar molecule in the training set (CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O) has a value of -0.93072175

Based on these patterns and the structural similarity to the examples, particularly considering the presence of:
- An aromatic ring
- A hydroxyl group
- Two methyl substituents
- Similar overall size and substitution pattern

I predict the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O to be approximately: -0.85

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly simpler than some of the most similar examples but maintains the key structural features that appear to drive the property value in the negative direction.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.769244538295572
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure with 4 chlorine atoms. Looking at similar structures in the training examples:

1. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl atoms) has value -0.86616937
2. Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl (5 Cl atoms) has value 0.02427528
3. Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl (4 Cl atoms) has value -0.68589784

The target molecule is most similar to these structures, particularly in having multiple chlorine substituents on a biphenyl core. It has 4 chlorine atoms, which is fewer than the first two examples but same as the third (though on a different core structure).

Considering these structural similarities and the pattern of values, I would predict a property value of approximately -0.45 for the target molecule. This prediction takes into account that:
- It has fewer chlorines than the most negative value example
- It maintains the biphenyl core like the second example
- The chlorine substitution pattern is more distributed than in the third example

Therefore, my predicted value is: -0.45

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.5675585566227802
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (2-methylbut-2-ene) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have negative values
2. Molecules with C=C bonds show varied values but often less negative than saturated analogs
3. Branched structures with similar size tend to have values in the -0.8 to -0.9 range
4. Small molecules with simple structures tend to have less extreme values

For CC=C(C)C:
- It's a small, branched alkene
- Contains one double bond
- Has 5 carbons total
- Has branching at the double bond
- Relatively simple structure

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- CCCCCCCCC=C (0.81325683) is much larger
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.80420966) is more complex
- CCCCCCCC (-0.92795599) is larger and saturated

Given these considerations and the molecule's characteristics, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.65

This prediction takes into account the molecule's small size, presence of a double bond (which tends to make values less negative compared to saturated analogs), and branching pattern.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.2649396322297237
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (very similar structure) has a value of -0.24248712
2. Other halogenated compounds like Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 have positive values (0.90440484)
3. Chlorinated aliphatic compounds show varying values
4. Phenolic compounds generally show moderate values

Given that the target molecule is almost identical to the first reference compound (Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl), just with a slightly different arrangement of chlorines, I would expect it to have a very similar property value.

Based on these observations, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.25

This prediction takes into account that:
- The core structure is nearly identical to the reference compound
- The slight change in chlorine positions should not dramatically affect the property
- The presence of both OH and Cl substituents tends to moderate the property values in the training set

Based on these considerations and the structural similarities, I predict the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C to be approximately:

0.76

This prediction takes into account the positive contributions from the sulfur, the nitrogen heterocycle, and the tert-butyl group, while considering the moderating effect of the carbonyl and NH-N groups.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.18773604058132815
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ethyl benzoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with aromatic rings and ester groups tend to have values between 0.2 and 0.6
2. The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to an aromatic ring often leads to moderate positive values
3. Simple esters (CCOC(=O)-) generally contribute to positive values
4. The molecule is relatively simple compared to many examples, which often correlates with moderate values

Considering these factors and comparing to similar structures in the examples, particularly:
- CCCCC(=O)OCC (0.19879929)
- CCCCCC(=O)OC (0.50975293)
- Other aromatic compounds with similar functional groups
