SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.53
Predicted Property:
Looking at the training examples and analyzing the given molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl decanoate), I can make the following observations:

1. This is an ester with a long alkyl chain
2. Similar compounds in the training set include:
   - CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl dodecanoate) with value -0.53
   - CCOC(=O)CC (ethyl propanoate) with value -0.53
   - Other esters show similar negative values

3. The target molecule has:
   - A medium-long alkyl chain (10 carbons)
   - An ester group (-C(=O)OC)
   - Similar structural features to other esters in the dataset

4. Looking at the patterns:
   - Longer chain esters tend to have values around -0.53
   - The presence of the ester group seems to contribute to negative values
   - The length of the carbon chain doesn't seem to dramatically affect the value once it's beyond a certain length

Based on these observations, and particularly the strong similarity to the longer chain ester in the training set, I would predict the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC to be:

-0.53

This prediction is based primarily on the very similar values seen for other ester compounds in the training set, particularly those with longer alkyl chains.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -1.2199999999999998
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 contains:
- A benzoxazolone core structure
- A chlorine substituent
- Fused bicyclic system
- Presence of carbonyl group
- NH group

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with heterocyclic structures tend to have negative values
- Presence of carbonyl groups generally contributes to more negative values
- Chlorine substituents typically make the value less negative
- Fused ring systems often lead to more negative values
- NH groups tend to contribute to more negative values

Considering these factors and comparing with similar molecules in the training set, particularly those containing heterocycles, carbonyl groups, and halogens, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-1.2

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has features that would make it moderately negative (heterocycle, carbonyl, NH) but not as extreme as some of the more complex or highly substituted molecules in the training set.
==================================================
Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6000000000000001
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (isopropyl nitrite, CC(C)N(=O)=O) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Smaller, simpler molecules tend to have values closer to zero
2. Molecules with nitro/nitroso groups often have negative values around -1 to -1.5
3. The presence of aliphatic chains tends to make values less negative
4. Highly aromatic structures have more negative values (around -2 to -3)

For CC(C)N(=O)=O:
- It's a relatively small molecule
- Contains a nitroso group (N(=O)=O)
- Has a simple branched aliphatic portion (isopropyl group)
- No aromatic rings
- Similar in complexity to molecules like CCCCCl (0.29) but with a nitroso group which tends to make values more negative

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's small size (which would push it closer to zero) balanced against the presence of the nitroso group (which tends to make values more negative).

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: -1.0000000000000002
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the given molecule (CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO), I notice:

1. It's a complex steroid-like structure
2. Contains multiple ring systems (4 fused rings)
3. Has oxygen-containing functional groups (ketone, hydroxyl)
4. Similar in complexity to the steroid example in the training set: CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C (-0.92)

Key observations from the training set:
- Complex polycyclic structures tend to have values between -1.0 and -3.0
- Presence of oxygen-containing groups tends to make values more negative
- The most similar molecule in the training set is the steroid structure with a value of -0.92

Given that this molecule:
- Has similar steroid core structure
- Contains additional oxygen-containing groups
- Is slightly more polar than the reference steroid due to the extra hydroxyl group

I predict the property value would be approximately: -1.15

This prediction is slightly more negative than the reference steroid (-0.92) due to the additional polar groups, but still within the range typically observed for complex polycyclic structures with oxygen-containing functionalities.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: -2.4699999999999993
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, I notice:

1. It contains a urea linkage (-NC(=O)NC(=O)-) similar to some training examples with urea groups that tend to have negative values
2. It has aromatic rings with halogen substituents (2 fluorines and 1 chlorine)
3. The overall structure is relatively complex with multiple functional groups
4. It shares some structural similarities with examples like CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O (-1.39) and other aromatic halogenated compounds

Considering:
- Molecules with urea groups typically show negative values
- Halogenated aromatics in the training set generally have values between -0.2 and -1.0
- The complexity and size of the molecule is similar to other examples with more negative values
- The presence of multiple polar groups (C=O, NH, halogens) typically leads to more negative values

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-1.45

This prediction takes into account both the structural features and the general trends observed in the training set, where similar complex molecules with multiple polar groups and aromatic rings tend to have values in this range.
==================================================
Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a branched ether with:
- A propyl group (CCCO-)
- A secondary carbon with a methyl group (-C(C)-)
- Overall relatively small and simple structure
- Similar polarity to alcohols and simple ethers in the training set

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- Simple alcohols like CCCCCO have values around -0.04
- Simple ethers and molecules with similar size/polarity tend to have values between -0.5 and 0.0
- The branching pattern is similar to some molecules that tend toward slightly negative values

Based on these observations and the structural similarities to other molecules in the training set, I predict the property value for CCCOC(C)C to be approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's more polar than pure hydrocarbons (which have values around 0.0)
2. Less polar than alcohols and complex aromatics (which have more negative values)
3. The branching and ether functionality typically contribute to slightly negative values
4. The size and complexity are moderate, suggesting a moderate negative value

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: -0.8400000000000001
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

The target molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O has several key features:
1. A pyrimidine-dione core structure
2. Bromine substituent
3. Ethyl and methyl branching
4. Two carbonyl groups
5. NH group

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with bromine typically have values around -0.8 (like CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, -0.83)
- Cyclic structures with carbonyls and NH groups tend to be negative (like O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC, -1.39)
- The presence of alkyl substituents (ethyl, methyl) typically makes the value less negative
- Heterocyclic structures with multiple heteroatoms generally have values in the negative range

Considering these factors and the overall structural similarity to other molecules in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-1.25

This prediction takes into account the molecule's polarity, size, and structural features while comparing it to similar molecules in the training set.

Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -1.5599999999999996
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The molecule "c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2" is biphenyl, which consists of two benzene rings connected directly to each other.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have values close to 0
2. Aromatic systems generally have negative values
3. The more complex and larger the aromatic system, the more negative the value tends to be
4. Biphenyl is relatively simple compared to larger PAHs in the examples
5. Similar sized aromatic compounds in the examples have values around -0.8 to -1.3

Considering these factors:
- It's larger than a single benzene ring but smaller than fused ring systems
- It has no substituents
- It's similar in complexity to compounds like "C1CCc2ccccc2C1" (-0.78) and "Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C" (-1.3)
- But it's simpler than those examples

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value for biphenyl to be approximately:

-0.95

This prediction takes into account that it's a purely aromatic system (pushing it negative) but relatively simple (keeping it from being too negative), placing it in between the values of similar compounds in the training set.
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.35
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule (CCCCS) and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

CCCCS is butanethiol, a relatively simple aliphatic molecule with:
- A straight chain of 4 carbons
- A terminal sulfur (thiol group)

Looking at patterns from the training examples:
1. Simple aliphatic molecules tend to have values close to 0
2. Molecules with similar size and complexity like:
   - CCCC(C)(C)C (0.0)
   - CCCC(=C)C (-0.26)
   - CCC1CCCCC1 (0.0)

The presence of sulfur might shift the value slightly, but not dramatically based on other examples containing sulfur like:
- COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O (0.06)
- Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1 (-0.9)

Given:
- The relatively simple aliphatic structure
- The moderate chain length
- The presence of a sulfur atom
- The overall molecular size and complexity

I would predict a property value of approximately 0.2 for CCCCS.

This prediction takes into account that simple aliphatic molecules in the training set tend to have values near zero, and the sulfur atom likely contributes a small positive shift to the property value.
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with:
- A primary alcohol group (-OH)
- Two methyl branches
- A butyl chain backbone

Looking at similar structures in the examples:
- CCCC(C)(C)C (without OH) has value 0.0
- CCCC(C)(O)CC (branched alcohol) has value -0.04
- CC(C)CC(C)O (branched alcohol) has value -0.04
- Simple alcohols generally show values around -0.04

The target molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is most similar to these examples, particularly to CCCC(C)(O)CC. The presence of the hydroxyl group (-OH) typically reduces the value slightly compared to the pure hydrocarbon analog.

Based on these structural similarities and patterns, I predict the property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO to be approximately -0.04.

This prediction takes into account:
1. The similar branching pattern to known examples
2. The presence of the hydroxyl group
3. The overall molecular size and structure
4. The consistent pattern of branched alcohols having values around -0.04 in the training set
==================================================
Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -1.2999999999999998
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is methylnaphthalene, which is structurally similar to several compounds in the training set:

1. Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (-1.82) - a more complex polycyclic aromatic
2. Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (-1.3) - dimethylnaphthalene
3. c1ccccc1 (-0.78) - benzene, simpler aromatic
4. C1Cc2ccccc2C1 (-0.78) - tetralin, partially saturated bicyclic

Looking at these structural analogs, I notice that:
- The target molecule is simpler than the first compound (-1.82)
- It has one less methyl group than the second compound (-1.3)
- It's more complex than benzene (-0.78)
- It's fully aromatic unlike tetralin (-0.78)

Based on these comparisons and the observed pattern that:
- Adding aromatic rings tends to decrease the value
- The property seems to become more negative with increasing molecular size
- Similar naphthalene derivatives are in the -1.3 to -1.8 range

I predict the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 to be approximately -1.3

This prediction takes into account that it's structurally very similar to the dimethylnaphthalene example but with one less methyl group, which should result in a similar but slightly less negative value.
==================================================
Iteration: 12
SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: -1.65
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The given molecule is a barbiturate derivative with:
- A core barbituric acid structure (similar to O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C in the training set, which has -1.65)
- Additional alkyl substitution (C(C)CCC) compared to the simpler methyl group in the reference
- Maintains the CC=C group at the same position

Key observations:
1. The base barbituric acid structure with CC=C substitution contributes similarly to the reference compound
2. The additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) would slightly decrease the property value due to increased hydrophobicity
3. The overall structure maintains similar hydrogen bonding capabilities

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-1.72

This prediction is slightly lower than the reference compound (-1.65) due to the additional alkyl substitution, while maintaining the core structural features that dominate the property.

Iteration: 13
SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.9900000000000001
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and my understanding of molecular structures.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene. Looking at the patterns in the training examples:

1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have slightly negative values
2. Halogenated compounds (with Cl, Br, I) tend to have values closer to zero or slightly positive
3. The presence of fluorine atoms typically makes molecules more lipophilic than other halogens
4. Single-ring aromatic structures generally have less negative values than multi-ring systems
5. The CF3 group is a strong electron-withdrawing group

Looking at similar structures in the examples:
- Chlorobenzene derivatives have values around 0.2 to 0.3
- Simple substituted benzenes have values between -0.5 to 0.3
- The CF3 group would likely contribute similarly to other halogen substituents

Considering these factors, I would predict a value of approximately -0.15 for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1.

This prediction takes into account that the CF3 group is more electronegative than Cl but still maintains some lipophilic character, placing it between the values seen for simple aromatic compounds and chlorinated aromatics in the training set.

1. The given molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a cyclic sugar (monosaccharide) structure with multiple hydroxyl groups.

2. Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO (glucose, linear form) has a value of -0.24
- Other highly hydroxylated compounds tend to have moderate negative values
- Cyclic structures generally contribute to slightly more negative values
- The presence of multiple OH groups typically leads to more negative values

3. Comparing structural features:
- This molecule has 6 oxygen atoms (5 OH groups + 1 cyclic O)
- It's cyclic like many of the examples with negative values
- It's highly polar due to the multiple hydroxyl groups
- It's similar in size and polarity to the glucose example

4. Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.28

This prediction is:
- Slightly more negative than the linear glucose (-0.24) due to the cyclic nature
- In line with other highly oxygenated compounds
- Consistent with the general trend for polar, hydroxylated molecules in the dataset

- Acetate group (CC(=O)O-)
- Ketone groups (C=O)
- Hydroxyl groups (-OH)
- Multiple ring systems typical of steroids
- Conjugated system with C=C and C=O

Looking at the training examples:
1. Complex steroid-like structures typically have values between -0.5 and -2.0
2. The presence of multiple oxygen-containing groups (acetate, ketones, hydroxyls) tends to make values more negative
3. Similar steroid examples in the training set:
- CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C (-0.63)
- CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C (-1.12)

Given that this molecule:
- Has more oxygen-containing groups than the reference steroids
- Contains a conjugated system
- Has similar core structure to examples but with additional functional groups

I predict the property value to be approximately: -1.45

This prediction takes into account that the additional polar groups and complexity would likely make it more negative than the simpler steroid examples, but not as extreme as some of the most negative values in the training set.

- A basic steroid skeleton
- An oxygen (hydroxyl group)
- A ketone group
- Multiple rings
- Mostly saturated carbons

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O has a value of -1.02
- Other complex polycyclic structures tend to have values between -1.0 and -2.0
- The presence of hydroxyl (-OH) and ketone (C=O) groups typically contributes to more negative values
- The molecule is relatively large and complex, which generally correlates with more negative values

Considering these factors, and noting that this molecule is slightly simpler than some of the more negative examples but still contains polar groups, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-1.15

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to the steroid example (-1.02) while considering the slight differences in functional groups and overall complexity.

The target molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is acetanilide with a nitro group para to the acetamido group.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with nitro groups (-NO2) generally have negative values (e.g., O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 = -1.38)
2. Aromatic compounds with polar substituents tend to have negative values
3. The presence of amide groups (-NHCOCH3) typically contributes to more negative values
4. Similar sized molecules with both polar groups and aromatic rings have values in the -1.3 to -2.0 range

Considering these patterns and specifically comparing to:
- Simple nitrobenzene (-1.38)
- Other aromatic compounds with multiple polar groups (-1.5 to -2.0)
- The increased polarity due to the acetamido group

I predict the property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O to be approximately -1.65

This prediction takes into account both the nitro group's electron-withdrawing effect and the acetamido group's polar nature, while considering the overall molecular size and polarity.

- CCCCC(CC)CO: -0.04

I notice a very consistent pattern where similar branched alcohols all have a property value of -0.04. The molecule in question (CC(C)(C)CO) is structurally very similar to these examples, particularly in having:
- A primary alcohol group (-CH2OH)
- Branched carbon structure
- Similar size/length

Based on these structural similarities and the very consistent property values seen in analogous molecules, I predict the property value for CC(C)(C)CO to be:

- More complex fused ring systems tend to have more negative values

The target molecule (fluorene) is less complex than anthracene but more complex than simple aromatics. It has three fused rings in a specific arrangement that makes it more rigid than linear PAHs.

Based on these structural considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately -1.8 for fluorene.

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's more complex than simple aromatics (which have values around -0.8)
2. It's less complex than anthracene (-2.34)
3. The rigid structure and fused ring system typically correlates with more negative values in the training set

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -1.7599999999999998
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, I notice:
1. It contains a sulfonamide group -S(=O)(=O)-
2. Has multiple nitrogen-containing groups (amine and amidine)
3. Contains a para-substituted benzene ring
4. Has polar functional groups
5. Is relatively compact but with several hydrogen bond donors/acceptors

Comparing to similar molecules in the training set:
- Molecules with sulfonamide groups tend to have values around -1.2 to -1.8
- Aromatic compounds with polar substituents generally show negative values
- Molecules with multiple nitrogen atoms typically have more negative values
- The presence of both hydrogen bond donors and acceptors pushes towards more negative values

Based on these structural features and patterns from the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-1.75

This prediction takes into account the molecule's polarity, size, and similarity to other compounds in the training set with comparable functional groups and structural features.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: -2.650000000000001
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, I notice:

1. It contains multiple nitro groups (N(=O)=O)
2. Has a trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)
3. Contains an alkene group (C=C)
4. Has a tertiary amine structure
5. Contains a substituted benzene ring

From the training examples, I observe that:
- Molecules with nitro groups tend to have more negative values (e.g., -1.58 for nitro-phenol)
- Complex aromatic structures with multiple substituents generally have more negative values
- The presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and CF3) typically leads to more negative values
- Molecules with similar complexity and multiple functional groups often have values between -2.0 and -2.5

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-2.15

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, the presence of strong electron-withdrawing groups, and its similarity to other molecules in the training set with comparable structural features.

Iteration: 26
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.53
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to make a prediction.

CC(C)OC=O is a formate ester with a branched (isopropyl) structure.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CC(C)CCOC=O (formate ester) has a value of -0.53
- CCCCCOC(=O)C (acetate ester) has a value of -0.53
- Simple esters and similar small oxygenated compounds tend to have values around -0.5 to -0.6
- The molecule has a similar size and functional group pattern to other formate/acetate esters

Given that:
1. It's a formate ester like CC(C)CCOC=O
2. It has similar polarity and size characteristics
3. The branching pattern (isopropyl group) shouldn't significantly alter the property
4. Multiple similar esters in the training set have values around -0.53

I predict the property value for CC(C)OC=O to be approximately -0.53.

Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.9800000000000001
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a phenol derivative with:
- A phenol group (-OH)
- Two methyl groups (-CH3)
- A benzene ring core structure

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. c1ccccc1O (simple phenol) has a value of -0.98
2. Cc1cccc(N)c1 (methylated aromatic with substituent) also has -0.98
3. Oc2ccc1CCCCc1c2 (more complex phenol) has -0.98
4. CCc1ccccc1C (dimethylated benzene without OH) has -0.78

The target molecule is most similar to these structures, particularly the simple phenol with additional methyl groups. The presence of the hydroxyl group seems to push values toward the negative direction around -0.98, while methyl groups tend to make the value slightly less negative.

Based on these patterns and the structural similarities, I predict the property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 to be approximately:

-0.95

This takes into account:
- The base phenol effect (around -0.98)
- A slight moderation of this negative value due to the two methyl groups
- The overall similarity to other aromatic compounds with polar substituents in the training set

Iteration: 28
SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: -0.06000000000000011
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, I notice:

1. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)) similar to several examples like COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (0.46) and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl (0.9)

2. Instead of halogen substituents (Cl, I, Br) on the benzene ring, this molecule has methylthio (SC) and methyl (C) groups

3. The basic skeleton is similar to other phosphorothioate pesticide-like structures in the training set, which generally show positive values

4. The methylthio group is less electronegative than halogens, which might slightly reduce the overall value compared to halogenated analogs

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.35

This prediction takes into account that:
- The molecule maintains the phosphorothioate core (contributing to positive values)
- Has less electronegative substituents than similar examples
- Shows similar structural features to other molecules in the training set with positive values
- The methylthio and methyl substituents likely make it slightly less positive than the halogenated analogs

Iteration: 29
SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: -0.11000000000000015
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has several key features:
1. It contains multiple chlorine atoms (5 Cl atoms)
2. It has a biphenyl-like structure (two benzene rings connected)
3. The chlorines are distributed across both rings

Looking at similar structures from the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl atoms on biphenyl) has value 0.18
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (7 Cl atoms on biphenyl) has value 0.47

The target molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than both reference molecules (5 vs 6-7)
- Similar biphenyl core structure
- More distributed chlorine pattern

Based on these observations and the trend that:
- More chlorines tend to increase the value
- Similar biphenyl structures with chlorines are in the 0.18-0.47 range
- Having fewer chlorines should give a slightly lower value

I predict the property value would be approximately 0.15

This prediction takes into account that the target molecule is slightly less chlorinated than the reference molecules but maintains a similar structural backbone.

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6000000000000001
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O, propyl nitrite) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. It has a short alkyl chain (propyl)
3. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - Simple alkyl chains (like CCC) tend to have values around 0.0
   - Addition of oxygen-containing groups typically makes values more negative
   - Molecules with N(=O)=O groups tend to have more negative values
   - The closest analogues in size and functionality show values around -0.5 to -1.0

Considering these factors, and noting that:
- It's larger than simple alkanes (which have values around 0)
- It has a polar nitro group which decreases the value
- But it's smaller than many of the highly negative compounds in the training set
- The short alkyl chain provides some hydrophobicity

I would predict a property value of approximately: -0.52

This prediction takes into account both the polar nitro group's tendency to decrease the value and the moderating effect of the short alkyl chain.
==================================================
Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.3700000000000001
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a benzene ring substituted with fluorine and bromine in different positions.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of -0.01 (similar dihalogen substitution)
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 patterns show similar meta substitution
- Bromine-containing aromatics generally contribute to slightly higher values
- Fluorine substitutions typically lead to slightly lower values than chlorine

Considering these patterns and the fact that:
1. The molecule has similar halogen substitution pattern to some training examples
2. F is generally more electronegative than Cl but has similar effects on this property
3. Br typically increases the value slightly
4. The meta substitution pattern is similar to some training examples

I would predict a value of approximately -0.15 for Fc1cccc(Br)c1.

This prediction takes into account that the value should be close to but slightly lower than the Cl-Br example (-0.01) due to the fluorine substitution.
==================================================
Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic structure with:
- Multiple methyl groups (C)
- A hydroxyl group (OH)
- A relatively compact and rigid structure
- No aromatic rings
- No halogens
- No nitrogen or other heteroatoms except oxygen

Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
- Simple alcohols like CCCC(C)(C)O and CC(C)(C)CO have values around -0.04
- Bicyclic structures tend to have slightly more negative values
- The presence of OH groups typically contributes to more negative values
- The molecule is relatively lipophilic due to the methyl groups
- It's structurally simpler than many of the more negative valued compounds

Considering these factors and comparing with the most similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is more complex than simple alcohols (-0.04) but less complex than the highly negative valued compounds (-1.0 to -2.0), and considers the contribution of the bicyclic structure and hydroxyl group.

Iteration: 33
SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -1.07
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and my understanding of molecular structures.

Looking at the target molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, I notice:

1. It's structurally similar to CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O from the training set (which has a value of -0.43)
2. The main difference is the absence of the SC(CCl) group in our target molecule
3. It contains:
   - A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
   - Two ethoxy groups (OCC)
   - A phthalimide ring system

Considering that:
- The removal of the SC(CCl) group would likely make it slightly less lipophilic
- The core structure remains similar to the reference compound
- The presence of the phthalimide ring system typically contributes to moderate hydrophobicity

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately -0.85 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a value:
- Less negative than highly aromatic systems (which tend to be around -2)
- More negative than simple aliphatics
- Slightly more negative than its closest structural analog (-0.43) due to reduced lipophilicity

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -1.7699999999999998
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The target molecule is a heterocyclic compound containing a pyrazolone ring with phenyl and methyl substituents.

2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with fused ring systems and N-heterocycles tend to have values around -2 to -3
- Molecules containing N-heterocycles with carbonyl groups typically show values between -2 and -2.5
- The presence of phenyl substituents generally contributes to more negative values
- Molecules with similar complexity and aromatic/heterocyclic nature tend to be in the -2 to -2.5 range

3. Key structural features of our target:
- Contains a pyrazolone ring
- Has N-phenyl substitution
- Has N-methyl substitution
- Contains a carbonyl group
- Overall moderate complexity

Based on these considerations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately -2.15 for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C.

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate complexity, presence of heterocyclic rings, carbonyl group, and aromatic substituents, which all tend to contribute to more negative values in the training set.

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.53
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCCCCC(=O)OCC is an ester with:
- A medium-length alkyl chain (6 carbons) on one side
- A short ethyl group (2 carbons) on the other side
- An ester functional group (-C(=O)O-) in the middle

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC has a value of -0.53 (longer chain ester)
- COC=O (methyl formate, simpler ester) has a value of -0.53
- CC(C)OC(=O)C (branched ester) has a value of -0.53
- Simple alkyl chains like CCCCC have values around 0.0

The target molecule is structurally between these examples, but most similar to other esters in the dataset. The ester functional group appears to contribute significantly to the property value, and the length of the alkyl chains seems to have a moderate effect.

Based on these observations and the consistent patterns seen with ester compounds in the training set, I predict the property value for CCCCCC(=O)OCC to be approximately:

-0.53

This prediction takes into account that esters in the training set consistently show values around this range, regardless of moderate variations in chain length.
==================================================
Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -1.31
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns that can help predict the property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate):

1. The molecule is similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) which has a value of -1.31
2. It's also similar to COCC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C but simpler
3. The presence of an ester group (COC(=O)) connected to a benzene ring is a common structural feature in several examples
4. It's smaller than ethyl benzoate by one carbon
5. Looking at the general trend, aromatic compounds with ester groups typically have values between -1.2 and -1.5

Given these observations, and considering that:
- The molecule is slightly smaller than ethyl benzoate
- The structural similarity to other aromatic esters
- The general trend for similar compounds

I would predict the property value to be approximately -1.28

This value takes into account that it should be very close to ethyl benzoate (-1.31) but slightly less negative due to its smaller size, while still maintaining the characteristic range for aromatic esters seen in the training examples.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.52
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (1,4-pentadiene) and predict its property value by comparing it with the given examples and considering key structural features:

1. The molecule C=CCC=C is a small, symmetric hydrocarbon with two terminal double bonds
2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
   - CC/C=C/C (2-pentene) has a value of -0.26
   - C=Cc1ccccc1 (styrene) has a value of -1.04
   - Simple hydrocarbons like C1CCCC1 (cyclopentane) has a value of 0.0
   - CCC(C)(C)CC (branched alkane) has a value of 0.0

3. Key considerations:
   - The molecule is small and relatively non-polar
   - It has two unsaturated bonds, which might increase reactivity
   - It's similar in size to 2-pentene but with an additional double bond
   - It lacks any functional groups that would dramatically affect the property

Based on these observations, particularly comparing with CC/C=C/C (-0.26) and considering the effect of the additional double bond, I would predict the property value for C=CCC=C to be approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account that the additional double bond would likely make the molecule slightly more reactive/polar than 2-pentene, but not dramatically so, as it's still a simple hydrocarbon.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Halogenated compounds tend to have values between -1 and +1
2. Small molecules with multiple halogens often have slightly positive values
3. Similar structures like FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br has a value of 0.56
4. The more halogens present, generally the more positive the value becomes
5. Smaller, symmetric molecules tend to have values closer to zero

Given that CBr3H is:
- A small molecule
- Contains three bromine atoms
- Has similar structural features to other halogenated methanes in the dataset
- Is relatively symmetric
- Has similar polarity characteristics to other trihalomethanes

Based on these observations and my chemical expertise, I predict the property value for CBr3H to be approximately:

2. Has a chlorinated carbon chain
3. Contains a phthalimide ring system
4. Has ethoxy groups
5. Overall, it's a relatively large, complex molecule with both polar and non-polar regions

- Molecules with similar size and complexity generally show negative values
- The presence of the phthalimide ring system likely contributes to increased polarity
- The combination of polar and non-polar regions is similar to several pesticide-like structures in the training set

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-1.2

This prediction takes into account the molecule's structural features and their similarity to the training examples, particularly considering its mixed polar/non-polar character and the presence of both aromatic and aliphatic regions.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -2.28
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains several key structural features:
- A urea linkage (N-C(=O)-N)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring
- A complex heterocyclic system with N-N and O linkages
- A tert-butyl group
- N,N-dimethyl substitution

2. Looking at similar structures from the training examples:
- Molecules with urea-like groups tend to have values around -1 to -2
- Chlorinated aromatics typically contribute to more negative values
- Complex heterocycles generally push towards more negative values
- The presence of multiple polar groups tends to make values more negative

3. Most similar examples from the training set:
- Complex heterocyclic structures with multiple substituents typically show values between -1.5 to -2.5
- Molecules with similar molecular weight and complexity show values in this range

Based on these considerations and the overall structural complexity and polarity of the molecule, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-2.1

This prediction takes into account the molecule's size, complexity, and the presence of multiple polar functional groups, while considering the trends observed in the training examples.

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: -1.0899999999999994
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has:
- A phenoxy linkage between two aromatic rings
- Three chlorine substituents
- One hydroxyl group
- Similar structural elements to some training examples, particularly the chlorinated phenols and biphenyls

Looking at relevant examples from the training set:
- Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl (-0.4) - dichlorophenol
- c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2 (-1.27) - chlorinated biphenyl
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (0.18) - tetrachlorophenol

The target molecule is more complex than a simple chlorophenol but less chlorinated than the tetrachlorophenol example. It has a diphenyl ether core with chlorine substituents, which would likely place its property value between the similar examples.

Based on these structural considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.85

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has both hydrophobic elements (chlorines, biphenyl structure) and hydrophilic elements (hydroxyl group), placing it in an intermediate range between the more polar and non-polar reference compounds.
==================================================
Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.26
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The molecule CC/C=C\C is a pentene (C5H10) with a trans (E) configuration at the double bond, while one of the training examples CC/C=C/C is also pentene but with a cis (Z) configuration, which had a value of -0.26.

Key observations:
1. Both molecules have the same molecular formula (C5H10)
2. Both are pentenes with a double bond
3. The only difference is the stereochemistry (cis vs trans)
4. Generally, trans isomers have very similar properties to their cis counterparts
5. Looking at other similar small hydrocarbons in the training set, they tend to have values close to 0

Given that:
- The cis isomer has a value of -0.26
- Trans isomers typically have very similar physical properties to their cis counterparts
- The difference in properties between cis and trans isomers is usually small

I predict the property value for CC/C=C\C to be approximately -0.26 (the same as its cis isomer) since the stereochemistry difference would likely have minimal impact on this particular property.
==================================================
Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

CCCOCC is a simple aliphatic ether with:
- A linear chain structure
- An oxygen atom in the middle
- No cyclic structures, aromatics, or other functional groups
- Similar in complexity to simple alkanes and alcohols

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- Simple alkanes like C (methane) have values around 0.0
- Simple alcohols like CC(C)O have values around -0.04
- Ethers tend to be slightly more negative than corresponding alkanes
- The molecule is most similar in structure to simple aliphatic compounds

Based on these observations and patterns, particularly considering:
1. The presence of the ether linkage which typically makes molecules slightly more polar
2. The similar chain length to some of the simpler examples
3. The lack of any complex functional groups

I predict the property value for CCCOCC to be approximately -0.15

This prediction takes into account that ethers typically have values slightly more negative than corresponding alkanes, but not as negative as alcohols or more complex molecules in the training set.

3. It has tertiary carbon with two methyl groups
4. Contains multiple aromatic systems
5. Has similar structural elements to some of the training examples with values around -2.0 to -2.4

Analyzing similar molecules from the training set:
- Complex molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have values between -1.5 to -2.4
- Molecules with N-C=O groups often show more negative values
- The presence of multiple phenyl rings typically pushes the value more negative
- Molecules with similar complexity and polar groups tend to be in the -2.0 to -2.4 range

Based on these observations and the structural similarities to other complex molecules in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-2.15

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, the presence of multiple aromatic rings, and the polar functional groups present in the structure.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is acetanilide with a bromine substituent (4-bromoacetanilide).

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Molecules with similar structural elements:
- Aromatic rings with substituents tend to have negative values
- Presence of bromine generally contributes slightly towards less negative values
- Amide groups (NC=O) typically contribute to more negative values
- Similar molecules like Fc1cccc(Br)c1 has -0.37
- Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 has -0.5
- Molecules with amide groups often have values between -1.0 and -2.0

Considering these factors:
- The basic aromatic structure would contribute a negative base value
- The amide group (acetamido) would make it more negative
- The bromine would slightly moderate the negative value
- The overall polarity and size of the molecule suggests a moderately negative value

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-1.4

This takes into account the combined effects of the aromatic ring, the polar amide group, and the bromine substituent, while staying within the general range observed for similar molecules in the training set.

- Simple alkylbenzenes generally show values between -0.7 and -1.0

The target molecule is most similar to these alkylbenzene structures, particularly the branched alkylbenzenes. It has:
- Similar size
- Similar branching pattern
- Similar hydrophobicity

Based on these structural similarities and patterns, I predict the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 to be approximately:

-0.78

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has very similar electronic and steric properties to p-cymene and ethyltoluene, which both have the same value in the training set.

Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -1.11
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple aromatic structures tend to have values between -0.5 and -1.5
2. The presence of oxygen-containing groups (especially C=O) tends to make values more negative
3. Simpler structures generally have less negative values than complex ones
4. Benzaldehyde has a relatively simple structure: one benzene ring with a single aldehyde group

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- COc1ccccc1 (anisole) has a value of -0.98
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (salicylamide) has a value of -1.51
- Simple benzene derivatives generally fall in the -0.8 to -1.2 range

Benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) is structurally simpler than salicylamide but has a similar carbonyl group. It's slightly more polar than anisole due to the aldehyde group, but not as polar as salicylamide.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for benzaldehyde to be approximately -1.15
==================================================
Iteration: 48
SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -2.71
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, I notice:

1. It contains a furan ring (five-membered oxygen heterocycle)
2. Has a nitro group (-NO2)
3. Contains a uracil-like ring structure
4. Has a hydrazone linkage
5. Multiple polar groups (C=O, N-N, NO2)

Analyzing similar structures from the training set:
- Molecules with heterocycles typically have values around -1.2 to -1.8
- Nitro-containing compounds tend to be more negative
- Multiple polar groups generally push the value more negative
- The presence of both aromatic and polar functionalities is similar to several examples that have values between -1.5 and -2.0

Considering these factors and comparing with the most similar structures in the training set, particularly:
- Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2, -1.78
- Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, -1.22

I predict the property value for O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 to be approximately:

-1.85

This prediction takes into account the molecule's higher polarity and greater number of hydrogen bond acceptors compared to the similar examples in the training set.

Iteration: 49
SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -1.9599999999999995
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training set, which has a value of -1.96. The only difference is that our target molecule has a single N-N bond instead of a N=N double bond.

Key observations:
1. Both molecules have two phenyl rings
2. Both have nitrogen atoms connecting the rings
3. The main difference is bond order between nitrogens
4. Both are relatively planar structures
5. Both have similar size and complexity

The single bond in our target molecule (compared to the double bond in the reference) would make it slightly more flexible and might affect its properties, but not drastically. Given that similar aromatic structures in the training set tend to have values in the negative range between -1.5 and -2.5, and considering the very close structural similarity to the reference compound (-1.96), I would predict a value very close to but slightly different from -1.96.

Predicted value: -1.92

This prediction takes into account that the single bond might slightly alter the property but not enough to cause a dramatic change from the very similar reference structure.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -1.3900000000000001
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is a cyclic imide structure with a spiro-cyclopentane ring. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1 (-1.26) - cyclic urea structure
2. O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC (-1.39) - similar cyclic imide with alkyl substitution
3. O=C1CCCN1 (-0.53) - simpler lactam structure

The target molecule has:
- A cyclic imide core (three C=O groups)
- A spiro-cyclopentane substituent
- Similar polarity to some training examples
- Moderate molecular weight
- No aromatic rings

Based on these structural features and comparing with similar molecules in the training set, particularly considering the cyclic imide examples and the effect of aliphatic substitution, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-1.35

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has similar polarity and size to several training examples with values in the -1.2 to -1.4 range, and the spiro-cyclopentane would contribute to a moderate negative value similar to other aliphatic-substituted cyclic systems in the training set.

Iteration: 51
SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.6900000000000002
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The target molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine substituents. Looking at the patterns in the training examples:

1. Molecules with multiple chlorines tend to have values between 0 and -1
2. Biphenyl-like structures generally contribute to more negative values
3. Similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccccc1Cl has a value of -0.2
- Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a value of -0.11

The target molecule has:
- A biphenyl core (making it similar to some of the more negative valued compounds)
- Three chlorine substituents (which typically make the value less negative than heavily functionalized molecules)
- No other functional groups

Considering these factors, and that similar chlorinated aromatics in the training set have values around -0.1 to -0.2, I predict the property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl to be approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account both the structural similarity to other chlorinated aromatics and the general trends observed in the training set.
==================================================
Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.78
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a para-diethylbenzene (benzene ring with two ethyl groups in para position).

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values between -1 and 0
2. Molecules with similar structure like CCCCCCc1ccccc1 (alkylbenzene) has a value of -0.78
3. The target molecule is less lipophilic than CCCCCCc1ccccc1 but more symmetric
4. Other simple aromatic compounds like O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) has -1.11
5. Cc1ccccc1N (methylaniline) has -0.98

Given these patterns and considering:
- The symmetrical nature of para-diethylbenzene
- The presence of two short alkyl chains (ethyl groups)
- The overall molecular size and complexity
- The lack of polar groups

I predict the property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 to be approximately -0.82

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a value:
- Less negative than benzaldehyde (-1.11)
- Similar to but slightly more negative than the longer chain alkylbenzene (-0.78)
- More negative than simple alkanes but less negative than aromatic compounds with polar substituents
==================================================
Iteration: 53
SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -1.07
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The target molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O has:
1. A benzene ring
2. An amino (-NH2) group
3. A sulfonamide group (-SO2NH2)

Looking at similar structures from the training set:
- Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a value of -1.58 (similar benzene ring with -NH2 and a different polar group)
- Other molecules with benzene rings and polar substituents typically have values between -1.0 and -2.0
- The sulfonamide group is polar like nitro groups but slightly less electron-withdrawing

Considering these factors:
- The overall polarity is similar to the nitroaniline example
- The sulfonamide group contributes to slightly less negative value than nitro
- The amino group contributes to increased water solubility

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-1.45

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a value:
1. More negative than simple aromatic compounds
2. Slightly less negative than the nitroaniline analog
3. In line with other polar aromatic compounds in the training set
==================================================
Iteration: 54
SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: -2.079999999999999
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The target molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with four fused rings, specifically a pyrene structure. Looking at the training examples, I notice:

1. Similar polycyclic aromatic structures tend to have values around -2.0 to -2.6
2. Specifically:
- c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 (a larger PAH) has value -2.6
- Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32 (a smaller PAH) has value -1.82
- c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 has value -2.34

The target molecule (pyrene) is similar in size and structure to these examples, but slightly smaller than the first example and larger than the second example. It has no substituents, just like the first example.

Based on these structural similarities and trends, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-2.0

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is a pure PAH system, similar in size to the reference compounds, and follows the general trend where larger conjugated aromatic systems tend to have more negative values in this property scale.

Key observations about the target molecule:
1. Contains multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups
2. Has a complex ring system with fused rings
3. Contains oxygen atoms in different environments (hydroxyl and ether)
4. Has aromatic rings
5. Contains a ketone group (C=O)
6. Overall structure is relatively large and complex

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
- Molecules with multiple OH groups tend to have negative values
- Larger, complex aromatic systems generally have more negative values
- Multiple oxygen-containing functional groups tend to push towards more negative values
- Fused ring systems typically have more negative values
- Similar polyphenolic structures in the training set have quite negative values

Comparing with similar molecules in the training set, particularly those with:
- Multiple hydroxyl groups
- Fused ring systems
- Multiple oxygen-containing functional groups

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately -2.8 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has features similar to some of the more negative-valued compounds in the training set, but isn't quite as large or complex as those with the most negative values (like -3.67).

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 0.009999999999999953
Predicted Property:

The target molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC has:
- A phosphate group P(=O)
- Methoxy group (COP)
- Thioether linkage (SC)
- Acetamido group (NC(C)=O)

Looking at similar molecules from the training set:
- Phosphate-containing molecules like CCN(CC)C(=O)C(=CCOP(=O)(OC)OC)Cl have values around -0.39
- Molecules with acetamido groups like CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 have values around -1.02
- Simpler molecules with P=O or P=S groups tend to have values between -0.5 and 0.5

Considering:
1. The molecule's moderate size
2. The presence of both polar groups (P=O, C=O) and less polar groups (SC, CH3)
3. The similarity to other phosphate-containing molecules
4. The presence of the acetamido group which tends to decrease the value

I predict the property value would be approximately: -0.75

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has features that would both increase and decrease the property value, with the polar groups likely having a stronger influence on the final value.
==================================================
Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.31999999999999995
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (trans-1,2-dichloroethene) and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Small, simple molecules tend to have values closer to 0
2. Halogenated compounds (especially with Cl) tend to have slightly positive or near-zero values
3. The molecule in question is small and contains two chlorine atoms
4. The presence of a double bond typically doesn't drastically affect the property in small molecules
5. Similar small halogenated compounds in the training set like CCBr and CCCCBr have values around 0.48

Given these observations and considering that:
- This is a very small molecule
- It contains two chlorine atoms
- It has a double bond in trans configuration
- It's relatively non-polar
- It's structurally simpler than most molecules in the training set

I would predict a value of approximately 0.4 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that small halogenated compounds tend to have positive values in the training set, but the double bond might slightly reduce the value compared to fully saturated analogs.

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.8500000000000001
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have negative values
2. Small molecules with nitrogen in aromatic rings typically have values between -1.5 and -2.0
3. The complexity and size of the molecule generally correlates with more negative values
4. Similar structures like COc2ncc1nccnc1n2 (-1.78) and c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 (-1.96) contain pyridine-like substructures

Given that pyridine is:
- A small aromatic molecule
- Contains one nitrogen atom
- Has a simple structure
- Is less complex than most examples shown
- Similar to but simpler than several reference compounds

I predict the property value would be approximately -1.20

This prediction takes into account that it's simpler than the more complex nitrogen-containing aromatics in the dataset (which have values around -1.8 to -2.0) but still maintains the basic aromatic nitrogen-containing structural features that tend to give negative values.

True Property: -2.669999999999999
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Key observations from the molecule:

2. Contains multiple aromatic rings
3. Has polar functional groups (OH, ester)
4. Contains a chlorine substituent
5. Has a quinoline-like structure
6. Contains an amine linkage

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Complex molecules with multiple rings typically have values between -1.5 to -2.5
- Molecules with quinoline-like structures (e.g., c1ccc2cnccc2c1) have values around -1.37
- Larger, more complex structures tend to be more negative
- The presence of polar groups (OH, ester) and aromatic rings typically pushes values more negative
- The chlorine substituent might slightly increase the value

Considering all these factors and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-2.15

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, polarity, and structural similarity to other molecules in the training set, particularly those with multiple rings and polar functional groups.

Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

CCCCCO is a primary alcohol with a 5-carbon chain (pentanol).

Looking at the patterns in the training set:
1. Longer chain alcohols like OC1CCCCCCC1 have a value of -0.04
2. Simple aliphatic compounds tend to have values closer to 0
3. The presence of oxygen typically makes the value slightly more negative
4. Shorter, simpler molecules generally have values closer to 0 than complex aromatic or polycyclic compounds
5. Similar aliphatic compounds with oxygen show values between 0 and -0.5

Considering these factors:
- This is a relatively simple aliphatic molecule
- It has one oxygen atom as a terminal alcohol
- It's shorter than cycloheptanol/cyclooctanol shown in the training set
- It lacks any complex structural features

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCCCCO to be approximately:

-0.23

This prediction takes into account that it should be slightly negative due to the alcohol group, but not as negative as more complex molecules, while being in line with other simple aliphatic compounds in the training set.

1. The molecule contains:
- A heterocyclic ring with S and O
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- An NH group connecting to a phenyl ring
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O))

2. Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and polar groups tend to have negative values
- Presence of sulfur-containing groups often leads to moderate negative values
- Molecules with similar complexity and polarity typically range from -1.0 to -2.0
- The presence of both hydrogen bond donors (NH) and acceptors (C=O, S=O) typically pushes towards more negative values

3. Comparing with specific examples:
- It's more complex than simple aromatics (-0.5 to -1.0)
- Has similar polarity to some pharmaceutical-like structures in the dataset
- Contains multiple polar groups like some of the more negative examples

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-1.42

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate size, multiple polar groups, and overall structural complexity while staying within the general range observed in the training examples.

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the given molecule COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C, I notice:

1. It contains multiple polar groups (esters -C(=O)OC, nitro -N(=O)=O)
2. Has an aromatic ring with a nitro substituent
3. Contains a complex heterocyclic core structure
4. Has multiple methyl and methoxy groups
5. Shows some structural similarity to other complex heterocyclic compounds in the training set

- Presence of nitro groups tends to make the value more negative
- Molecules with multiple ester groups also tend to have more negative values
- The combination of aromatic rings with polar substituents generally results in values below -2.0

Based on these observations and patterns, I predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately:

-2.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, polarity, and structural features similar to other molecules in the training set.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -1.3900000000000001
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The target molecule is a cyclic structure containing multiple carbonyl groups (C=O) and nitrogen atoms in a ring system.

2. Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Molecules with multiple carbonyl groups tend to have negative values
- Cyclic structures generally contribute to more negative values
- Presence of nitrogen atoms in rings also tends to lead to more negative values
- The molecule is relatively small and compact compared to many examples

3. Some relevant comparisons from the training set:
- Simple cyclic structures like cyclohexane have values around 0
- Molecules with amide groups (-NC(=O)-) typically have values between -1 and -2.5
- The size and complexity is moderate

4. Considering these factors:
- The presence of three carbonyl groups will push the value negative
- The cyclic structure with nitrogens will further contribute to a negative value
- The small cyclopropane ring (CC1) will slightly moderate the negative value

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-1.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's structural features while staying within the general range of values seen in the training set for molecules with similar functional groups and complexity.

Iteration: 64
SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 0.29
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (ClCC - chloroethane) and predict its property value by comparing it to the given examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a very small molecule with just 2 carbons and a chlorine
2. It's similar in size and composition to some of the simpler molecules in the training set
3. Looking at similar structures:
- CCCCC (pentane) has value 0.0
- Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) has value -0.49
- Simple aliphatic molecules tend to have values close to 0
- Small chlorinated compounds tend to have slightly negative to slightly positive values

Given that ClCC is:
- Smaller than chlorobenzene
- Has an aliphatic (not aromatic) structure
- Contains one chlorine which typically increases the value slightly
- Is more similar to the simple alkanes in structure

I would predict a value of approximately -0.15 for ClCC.

This prediction takes into account that the property appears to become more negative with increasing molecular size and aromatic character, while chlorination tends to make it slightly more positive. The small size and simple structure of ClCC suggests it should have a value close to zero but slightly negative due to the chlorine substitution.
==================================================
Iteration: 65
SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 0.3099999999999999
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl contains:
1. A pyridine ring (heterocyclic aromatic)
2. Multiple chlorine atoms (4 in total)
3. A trichloromethyl group (-CCl3)

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have values between 0 and 1
- ClCC(Cl)Cl has a value of 0.87
- Compounds with aromatic rings and halogens tend to have slightly lower values
- The presence of nitrogen in aromatic rings often reduces the value somewhat

Considering these factors:
- The multiple chlorines would push the value higher (similar to other chlorinated compounds)
- The pyridine ring would slightly decrease the value compared to purely chlorinated aliphatic compounds
- The overall structure suggests a moderate value

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.45

This prediction takes into account both the electron-withdrawing effects of the chlorines and the electronic effects of the pyridine ring, placing it between purely chlorinated compounds and aromatic halogenated compounds in the training set.
==================================================
Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CCCCC(C)O is a branched primary alcohol with 6 carbons (hexanol with a methyl branch).

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCCC(O)CCC (heptanol) has a value of -0.04
- CCC(C)CCO (branched hexanol) has a value of -0.04
- CC(O)c1ccccc1 (more complex alcohol) has a value of -0.82
- CCCCCCC#C (7-carbon chain, different functional group) has a value of -0.44

The closest analogues are the other aliphatic alcohols, particularly CCC(C)CCO which has the same number of carbons and is also branched. The presence of the hydroxyl group and similar carbon chain length suggests this molecule should have a very similar value.

Based on these comparisons, especially noting that both CCCC(O)CCC and CCC(C)CCO have exactly the same value of -0.04, and given that CCCCC(C)O is very similar in structure and polarity, I predict:

Predicted value for CCCCC(C)O: -0.04

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.17999999999999994
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and my understanding of molecular structures.

The molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is 1,4-dibromobenzene, which has two bromine atoms in para position on a benzene ring.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Halogenated aromatics generally have negative values
2. Di-halogenated benzenes show values around -0.4 to -1.0
3. Chlorinated benzenes appear several times in the dataset
4. The size and electronegativity of bromine vs chlorine needs to be considered

Comparing specifically to similar structures:
- Chlorinated benzenes show values around -0.4 to -1.0
- Bromine is larger and less electronegative than chlorine
- The para substitution pattern is symmetric

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.85

This prediction takes into account that bromine-containing compounds often show similar but slightly more negative values than their chlorine analogs due to bromine's larger size and different electronic properties.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 0.17999999999999983
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and the target molecule, I notice this is likely predicting a physicochemical property, possibly related to solubility or partition coefficients, given the range of values (-3.35 to 1.34).

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure. Looking at similar structures in the training set, particularly:

Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (value: 1.34)

The target molecule has:
- Similar biphenyl core structure
- Fewer chlorine substituents (6 vs 10)
- Similar hydrophobic character
- Similar molecular size

The example molecule with 10 chlorines has a value of 1.34. Since the target molecule has fewer chlorines (which typically contribute positively to this property), I would expect a slightly lower but still positive value.

Based on the structural analysis and comparison with similar molecules in the training set, I predict the property value for the target molecule to be approximately:

1.05

This takes into account the similar core structure but reduced chlorination compared to the closest analog in the training set.

5. Contains both polar (P=O) and nonpolar (aromatic, methyl) regions

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- Complex aromatic structures typically show values between -1.5 to -2.5
- Phosphate-containing compounds tend to be in the negative range
- Multiple aromatic rings with substituents often lead to more negative values
- The presence of both polar and nonpolar regions suggests moderate negativity

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

True Property: -0.9400000000000002
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3)
- A phenyl ring
- A chlorinated N-containing heterocycle
- A ketone group
- Two chlorine atoms

2. Looking at similar structural patterns in the training set:
- Molecules with halogen substituents typically have values between -2 and 0
- Complex cyclic structures with multiple functional groups tend to have more negative values
- The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) often contributes to more negative values
- Molecules with similar complexity and size typically have values between -1.5 and -2.5

3. Considering specific examples:
- Similar sized molecules with multiple halogens and cyclic structures show values around -1.5 to -2.0
- The presence of CF3 and multiple chlorines might make it slightly less negative than purely aromatic structures

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training set, I predict the property value for FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O to be approximately:

-1.95

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, the presence of multiple electronegative groups, and its similarity to other structures in the training set.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.58
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is a nitro-anisole (methoxybenzene with a nitro group).

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Aromatic compounds generally have negative values
2. Nitro groups tend to make the value more negative (see example O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O at -1.98)
3. Methoxy substituents (COc-) also typically contribute to negative values
4. Single nitro compounds tend to be less negative than dinitro compounds

The most similar compounds in the training set are:
- O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-1.98, but has two nitro groups)
- Simple aromatic compounds like c1ccccc1O (-0.98)

Given that this molecule has:
- One nitro group (less negative than dinitro)
- One methoxy group (slightly electron-donating)
- A benzene ring core

I would predict a property value of approximately -1.45

This value takes into account that it should be:
- More negative than simple aromatics
- Less negative than dinitrobenzene
- In line with other substituted aromatic compounds in the dataset

The target molecule is a complex polychlorinated structure with multiple chlorine atoms and a rigid cyclic framework. Looking at the patterns in the training data:

1. Highly chlorinated molecules tend to have positive values
   - ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl has 1.74
   - BrC(Br)Br has 1.44
   - Simple chlorinated compounds like ClCCCl has 0.58

2. The target molecule shares structural similarities with the hexachlorocyclohexane example (ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, 1.74), but has an even more complex bridged structure and additional chlorine atoms.

3. The presence of multiple chlorines typically increases the value towards the positive direction, as seen in the training examples.

4. The rigid cyclic structure might slightly moderate the extreme positive value that would be expected from chlorine content alone.

Based on these observations and considering that this molecule has:
- Multiple chlorine substituents
- A rigid cyclic framework
- Similar but more complex structure compared to the hexachlorocyclohexane example

I would predict a property value of approximately 1.85 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that it should be somewhat higher than the hexachlorocyclohexane example (1.74) due to additional chlorination, but the rigid structure might slightly moderate the increase.

1. Longer aliphatic chains tend to have values closer to zero or slightly negative
2. Esters generally contribute to slightly more negative values
3. The molecule has similar features to some aliphatic compounds in the training set
4. The length of the carbon chain will partially offset the negative contribution of the ester group
5. Similar compounds with oxygen-containing functional groups but shorter chains show values around -0.3 to -1.0

Considering these factors:
- The long aliphatic chain (10 carbons) will push the value closer to zero
- The ester group will contribute a negative component
- The overall size and polarity balance suggests a moderately negative value

Based on my analysis of the structural features and patterns in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account both the hydrophobic nature of the long carbon chain and the polar contribution of the ester group.

The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is a nitrophenol, specifically 3-nitrophenol (or m-nitrophenol).

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
1. Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (nitrotoluene) has a value of -1.38
2. Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 (3-chloroaniline) has a value of -0.69
3. Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 (dimethylphenol) has a value of -0.98

- Meta substitution pattern

Considering these factors and comparing with the similar structures, especially the nitro-containing compounds and phenols in the training set, I predict the property value to be:

-1.45

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The nitro group typically contributes similarly to what we see in nitrotoluene (-1.38)
2. The hydroxyl group would make it slightly more polar than nitrotoluene
3. The meta substitution pattern typically has intermediate effects compared to ortho/para

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples. The molecule CCCCCCCC is octane, a straight-chain saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).

3. CCCC/C=C/C (heptene) has a value of -0.26
4. CCCCCC1CCCC1 (a branched alkane) has a value of 0.0

Since CCCCCCCC is a straight-chain alkane with no functional groups, and considering the patterns where similar hydrophobic molecules have values very close to 0, I would predict the property value to be:

- CC(C)C(=O)C (-0.33)
- CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O (-0.63)

The target molecule shares most structural similarity with these steroid-based molecules, particularly the ones with -OH and C=O groups. However, it has an additional alkyne group which would likely make it slightly more negative.

Considering:
1. The base steroid structure typically gives values around -0.6 to -1.0
2. Additional polar groups (OH, C=O) tend to make the value more negative
3. The alkyne group would contribute to making it slightly more negative

2. Similar structures in the training set include:
- Fc1ccccc1 (-0.85)

- The size and position of the substituents
- The overall molecular weight and polarity

I predict the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl to be approximately: -0.85

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a moderately negative value due to the hydroxyl group, but not as negative as the nitro-substituted phenol in the training set, while the chloro substituent pulls the value slightly toward the positive direction.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.58
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) by comparing it to the given examples and looking for structural similarities and patterns.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Similar small halogenated compounds like ClCCCl has a value of 0.58

Key considerations:
- It's a very small molecule
- It has two chlorine atoms
- It's symmetric
- It's similar to ClCCCl but with one less carbon
- Halogenated small molecules in the training set tend to have positive values

Based on these observations and patterns, particularly comparing it to ClCCCl (0.58) but accounting for its smaller size, I would predict the property value for ClCCl to be approximately:

0.48

This prediction takes into account that it should be in a similar range as other small halogenated compounds but slightly lower than ClCCCl due to its smaller size.

2. Oc1cccc(O)c1 (-1.18) - A dihydroxybenzene, showing the effect of OH groups
3. Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (-1.58) - A substituted phenol, but with a stronger electron-withdrawing group

The target molecule has:
- One hydroxyl group (OH)
- Two methyl groups (CH3)
- Similar overall structure to example 1

The methyl groups are less polar than the OH group and will contribute to a slightly more positive value compared to dihydroxybenzene. The structure is most similar to example 1 (CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O), but with a slightly simpler substitution pattern.

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training set, I predict the property value to be approximately:

The target molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl has these key characteristics:
1. It's a biaryl system (two benzene rings connected)
2. Contains 4 chlorine atoms
3. Has similar structural features to some molecules in the training set, particularly:
   - Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (value: 0.18)
   - Other chlorinated aromatic compounds in the dataset

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
- Highly chlorinated aromatics tend to have values around 0 to 1
- Biaryl systems without polar groups tend to be slightly negative to positive
- The number of chlorine atoms increases the value
- The most similar compound has a value of 0.18

Considering these factors, and that this molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than the most similar compound
- Similar biaryl system
- No other functional groups

I predict the property value would be approximately 0.05

This prediction takes into account that it should be slightly lower than the similar compound with more chlorines (0.18) but still positive due to the chlorination pattern and biaryl system.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.26
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule CC=C(C)C (2-methylbut-2-ene), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1. This is a relatively small, simple hydrocarbon
2. It contains a double bond
3. It's branched with methyl groups
4. It's similar in complexity to molecules like CCCCC and other simple hydrocarbons in the training set
5. Looking at similar molecules in the dataset:
   - Simple hydrocarbons tend to have values close to 0
   - The presence of double bonds tends to slightly decrease the value
   - Small molecules generally have values between -0.8 and 0

Based on these patterns and considering the molecular structure, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.26

This prediction is based on:
- Its similarity to other simple hydrocarbons in the dataset
- The presence of the double bond (which tends to make the value slightly negative)
- Its size and branching pattern
- Comparison with similar molecules in the training set like CCCCCCCCC=C (-0.26) but accounting for this molecule being smaller

Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.58
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (dichloromethane, CH2Cl2) and predict its property value by comparing it with the given examples and considering several key factors:

1. The molecule is very small and symmetric
2. It contains two chlorine atoms
3. Looking at other chlorinated compounds in the training set:
   - Highly chlorinated compounds tend to have positive values (e.g., ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl at 0.9)
   - Simple chlorinated compounds tend to have values closer to zero
4. The molecule is relatively non-polar
5. It's smaller than most molecules in the training set

Based on these observations, particularly comparing it with similar chlorinated compounds and considering its small size and symmetry, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.4

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's more chlorinated than simple organic molecules (which have values around 0)
- It's less chlorinated than compounds like tetrachloroethylene (0.9)
- Its small size and simple structure would likely place it in the moderate positive range
- It lacks complex functional groups or aromatic systems that tend to drive values negative

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.1100000000000001
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms in different positions compared to the similar structure in the training set: Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (-0.11).

Key observations:
1. Both molecules are trichlorinated phenols
2. They have the same number of chlorine atoms (3) and one hydroxyl group
3. The chlorine positioning is slightly different but maintains similar electronic effects
4. Both molecules have similar size and likely similar physicochemical properties

Given that:
- The reference molecule Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl has a value of -0.11
- The chlorine arrangement pattern is slightly different but should have minimal impact on the overall property
- Both molecules have very similar molecular weight and electronic properties

I predict the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl to be approximately -0.13

This prediction is based on the slight difference in chlorine positioning which might marginally affect the property, but should remain very close to the reference value of -0.11.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -3.3299999999999996
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this complex molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the given molecule, I notice:
1. It's a large, complex natural product-like structure
2. Contains multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters, hydroxyl)
3. Has aromatic rings with substituents
4. Contains multiple cyclic structures
5. Has high molecular weight
6. Contains multiple polar groups
7. Has a complex 3D structure

Analyzing the training examples:
- Larger, more complex molecules tend to have more negative values
- Molecules with multiple oxygen-containing groups tend to be more negative
- Molecules with fused ring systems typically have values between -2.0 and -3.0
- Natural product-like structures with multiple stereocenters and oxygenated functions typically have values between -1.0 and -3.0

Given these patterns and the structural complexity of the molecule in question, I would predict a property value of approximately -2.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's similarity to other complex, highly oxygenated structures in the training set, while considering its unique structural features and the general trends observed in the training data.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -1.04
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, I notice:
1. It contains a heterocyclic ring structure with multiple nitrogen atoms
2. Has a thioether (CSc-) group
3. Contains a carbonyl group
4. Has a tert-butyl substituent (C(C)(C)C)
5. Has an amino substituent (-N)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a property value of -1.21
- This is particularly relevant as it also contains an nnc ring system and a tert-butyl group
- Other heterocyclic compounds with similar polarity tend to have values between -1.0 and -2.0

Considering these factors and the structural similarities, I would predict a property value of approximately -1.25 for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C.

This prediction takes into account:
- The similar polarity to reference compounds
- The presence of similar functional groups
- The overall molecular size
- The balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic portions of the molecule

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -1.31
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate (an aromatic ester).

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple esters like CCCCCC(=O)OC and CCCCC(=O)OCC have values around -0.53
2. Benzene-containing compounds generally show negative values
3. Compounds with similar size and functional groups (aromatic ring + ester) tend to have values between -1.0 and -2.0
4. The presence of the ethoxy carbonyl group (CCOC(=O)-) attached to benzene is similar to some other examples with comparable polarity

Based on these observations and patterns, particularly considering:
- The presence of the aromatic ring
- The ester functional group
- The overall molecular size
- The similarity to other aromatic esters in the dataset

I predict the property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 to be approximately -1.32

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is more complex than simple aliphatic esters (-0.53) but less complex than many of the multi-ring or highly substituted structures that show more negative values.

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.48
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (1-bromoheptane, CCCCCCCBr) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple linear halogenated alkanes tend to have values around 0 to 1
2. Longer carbon chains without complex functional groups tend to have values between -0.5 and 0.5
3. The presence of bromine (Br) typically contributes similarly to chlorine (Cl) in terms of the property value
4. Similar molecules in the training set include:
   - CCCCCCC=C (-0.26)
   - CCCCCCCO (-0.04)
   - Simple halogenated compounds like CI (0.73)

Given that CCCCCCCBr is:
- A linear alkyl chain (7 carbons)
- Has a single bromine terminal group
- Similar in structure to CCCCCCC=C but with Br instead of =C

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account that the bromine will likely make the value slightly more negative than CCCCCCC=C (-0.26), but not as negative as CCCCCCCO (-0.04), while maintaining consistency with the overall patterns observed in the training set.

SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the given examples and my understanding of molecular structures.

CO (methanol) is a very simple molecule with one carbon atom bonded to one hydroxyl group (-OH). Looking at the training examples, I can observe that:

1. Small, simple molecules generally have values closer to zero
2. Molecules with hydroxyl groups (-OH) tend to have slightly negative values
3. Similar simple alcohols in the examples:
   - CCC(C)CO (pentanol) has a value of -0.04
   - CCCC(O)CCC (heptanol) has a value of -0.04
   - CC(O)c1ccccc1 (more complex alcohol) has a value of -0.82

Since methanol (CO) is:
- Smaller than the example alcohols
- Has similar functional group (hydroxyl)
- Is one of the simplest alcohols possible
- Lacks complex structural features

I would predict the property value for CO (methanol) to be approximately -0.04

This prediction takes into account that simpler molecules tend to have values closer to zero, and the hydroxyl group contributes a slight negative value based on the patterns observed in the training set.
