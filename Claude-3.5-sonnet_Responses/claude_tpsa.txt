SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 26.3
Predicted Property:
Looking at the patterns in the given examples, I notice several key points:

1. Simple alkanes (like CCCCCC) consistently have a value of 0.0
2. Esters (compounds with C(=O)OC group) typically have values around 26.3
   - For example, CC(C)COC(=O)C and CCOC(=O)CC both have exactly 26.3
3. The molecule in question (CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC) is a methyl ester with a long alkyl chain
4. Looking at CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC from the examples, which is very similar but just two carbons longer, also has a value of 26.3

Based on these observations, particularly the consistent pattern for esters and the exact match with a very similar molecule, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC to be:

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 46.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict the property value.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is a benzoxazolone derivative with a chlorine substituent. Looking at the patterns in the training data:

1. Molecules containing lactam/cyclic amide structures (like the NC(=O) pattern) tend to have higher values (around 50-75)
2. Simple chlorinated aromatics often have values around 0-20
3. Heterocyclic compounds containing oxygen and nitrogen in a ring system with a carbonyl group typically show moderate to high values
4. The presence of [nH] (NH in heterocycles) often contributes to higher values

This molecule shares structural similarities with several examples in the training set, particularly:
- It has a cyclic amide/lactam-like structure
- Contains a chlorine on an aromatic ring
- Has a heterocyclic system with O and N
- Contains a carbonyl group in a ring system

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately 54.5 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that similar heterocyclic structures with carbonyl groups typically show values in the 50-75 range, but the presence of the chlorine substituent might moderate this somewhat.

Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 43.14
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecular structure of CC(C)N(=O)=O (isopropyl nitrite), I can make several observations:

1. Molecules containing nitro/nitroso groups (-N(=O)=O) generally show higher property values (like in Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO which has 81.19)

2. Small, simple aliphatic molecules with just carbon and hydrogen tend to have values close to 0.0

3. The presence of nitrogen and oxygen atoms, particularly in combination, tends to increase the property value

4. The molecule in question is relatively small and simple, but contains the significant N(=O)=O group

5. Looking at similar sized molecules with nitrogen-oxygen functionalities in the training set, and considering the contribution of the isopropyl group

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict the property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O to be approximately:

42.5

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has a polar nitro group which typically increases the property value, but is also relatively small and has a simple aliphatic portion, which would moderate the overall value.

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 74.6
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the given molecule (CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO), I notice:

1. It's a complex steroid-like structure
2. Contains ketone groups (C=O)
3. Contains hydroxyl groups (OH)
4. Has multiple ring systems
5. Similar in complexity to the steroid example in the training set: CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C which has a value of 34.14

The target molecule shares several structural features with this steroid example, but has additional functional groups (hydroxyl and an extra ketone). These oxygen-containing groups typically increase the property value slightly based on the patterns in the training set.

Given these observations and the trends in the training data:
- Steroid cores tend to have values around 30-40
- Additional oxygen-containing groups tend to increase the value
- The complexity and size are similar to known examples

I predict the property value to be approximately 37.5

This prediction takes into account the base steroid value (~34) plus a small increment for the additional polar functional groups.

2. It has halogen substituents (F, Cl) but they're connected to aromatic rings

3. The structure has some similarity to CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O which has a value of 75.27

4. It contains multiple polar groups (C=O, N-H) which generally contribute to higher values

5. The presence of aromatic rings with halogens typically doesn't contribute much to the property based on the training examples

Based on these observations and patterns, particularly the presence of the urea linkage and multiple polar groups, I would predict a property value of approximately:

67.5

This prediction takes into account that compounds with similar functional groups (urea derivatives, multiple C=O groups, and N-H bonds) typically show values in the 55-75 range, while the presence of halogens on aromatic rings doesn't significantly decrease this value based on the training examples.

- Overall a relatively simple, small molecule with oxygen as the only heteroatom

Looking at similar molecules from the training set:
- Simple alcohols like CCCCCO have value 20.23
- Simple ethers and molecules with similar size/complexity like CC1CCCO1 have values around 9-20
- Molecules with similar oxygen-containing functional groups and chain lengths tend to have values in the 15-25 range

The molecule is most similar to aliphatic alcohols and ethers in the training set, which typically have values around 20.23 (like CCCCCO, CCCCCC(O)CC).

Based on these patterns and the molecule's structural features, I would predict a property value of approximately:

20.23

This prediction is based on the observation that similar aliphatic molecules containing oxygen typically have this value in the training set, and this molecule shares many structural characteristics with those examples.

- Cyclic structures containing N and carbonyls often have values in the 50-80 range
- The presence of NH and C=O groups typically increases the value
- Molecules with similar complexity and heteroatom content tend to have values in the 45-65 range

Considering these patterns and structural features, I would predict a property value of approximately 54.8 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of bromine
- The heterocyclic nature
- The carbonyl groups
- The overall molecular complexity

Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. Molecules with only carbon and hydrogen atoms (like alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and simple aromatic hydrocarbons) tend to have a property value of 0.0

2. The target molecule (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) is biphenyl, which consists of two benzene rings connected by a single bond, containing only carbon and hydrogen atoms.

3. Similar structures in the training set that are purely hydrocarbon-based aromatic systems (like naphthalene derivatives without other functional groups) consistently show a value of 0.0

4. The presence of heteroatoms (N, O, S, etc.) or functional groups typically leads to non-zero values, but our target molecule has none of these.

Based on these observations, and particularly the pattern that pure hydrocarbon aromatic systems consistently show a value of 0.0, I predict that the property value for biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be:

0.0

This prediction is made with high confidence due to the consistent pattern observed in similar structures in the training set.
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule (CCCCS) and the patterns in the training examples to make a prediction.

Looking at the training examples, I notice several patterns:
1. Many simple hydrocarbons and highly symmetric molecules have a value of 0.0
2. Molecules containing oxygen (especially alcohols) often have values around 20
3. More complex molecules with multiple heteroatoms tend to have higher values
4. Molecules with sulfur seem to have moderate values, typically in the 20-50 range

CCCCS is butanethiol, a simple linear molecule with:
- A straight chain of 4 carbons
- A terminal sulfur (thiol group)
- No complex functional groups
- No aromatic rings
- Similar in simplicity to some of the alkanes in the training set

Based on these observations and comparing to similar molecules in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately 18.0 for CCCCS.

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's more complex than simple hydrocarbons (which have 0.0)
- It contains sulfur which typically contributes some value
- It's relatively simple compared to molecules with high values
- It's similar in complexity to some of the simpler molecules that have values in the 15-25 range

- CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C (without OH) has a value of 0.0
- Simple alcohols and branched alcohols consistently show values around 20.23

Based on these patterns, I predict that CCCC(C)(C)CO would have a property value of 20.23.

This prediction is supported by:
1. Other alcohols in the dataset consistently show this value
2. The branching pattern doesn't seem to significantly affect this property when an alcohol group is present
3. Similar molecular weight and structure alcohols show the same value

Therefore, my prediction for CCCC(C)(C)CO is 20.23

Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict the property value.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 75.27000000000001
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, I can make the following observations:

1. This molecule is similar in structure to O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C (which has a value of 75.27) from the training set
2. The main difference is that instead of a methyl group (C), it has a larger alkyl substituent (C(C)CCC)
3. The core structure (barbituric acid derivative) is the same
4. The presence of the CC=C group is maintained

Based on these observations:
- The core barbituric acid structure contributes significantly to the property
- The slightly larger alkyl substituent might slightly modify the value, but shouldn't change it dramatically
- The unsaturated CC=C portion is maintained

Given these considerations and the similarity to the known molecule, I would predict a property value of approximately 77.5

This prediction is slightly higher than the reference molecule (75.27) due to the larger alkyl substituent, but maintains a similar range due to the preserved core structure and functional groups.

- Other simple substituted aromatics without polar groups show 0.0
- The CF3 group, while polar, is similar to other halogen substituents in terms of its contribution

Therefore, I predict the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 to be:

0.0

This prediction is based on the molecule's structural similarity to other halogenated aromatics in the training set that consistently show a value of 0.0.

Given these considerations, and the fact that this molecule is very similar to glucose but with one less hydroxyl group and in a cyclic form, I would predict a value of approximately:

110.5

This prediction is slightly lower than glucose (121.38) because it has one less hydroxyl group, but still maintains a high value due to the multiple oxygen atoms and hydroxyl groups present in the structure.

- Aromatic compounds with polar substituents typically have moderate to high values

Given these observations and the structural features of the target molecule, I would predict a property value of approximately 85.7

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of multiple polar groups
- The sulfonamide functionality
- Multiple nitrogen atoms
- The aromatic ring with polar substituents
- The overall polarity and H-bonding capability of the molecule

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 89.51999999999998
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and the target molecule, I can analyze several key patterns:

1. Molecules with nitro groups (-NO2) generally have higher property values (see examples with N(=O)=O groups)
2. The presence of trifluoromethyl groups (CF3) often contributes to increased values
3. Aromatic compounds with multiple substituents tend to have higher values
4. The presence of amine groups (especially tertiary amines) contributes to the property
5. Multiple electron-withdrawing groups on an aromatic ring increase the value

The target molecule contains:
- Two nitro groups
- A trifluoromethyl group
- A tertiary amine with an alkenyl substituent
- Multiple substituents on an aromatic ring

Comparing to similar structures in the training set and considering the additive effects of these groups, I would predict a property value of approximately 82.5

This prediction takes into account:
- The base contribution from the aromatic system
- The significant contribution from two nitro groups
- The additional effect of the trifluoromethyl group
- The contribution from the tertiary amine
- The slight modification due to the alkenyl group
==================================================
Iteration: 26
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 26.3
Predicted Property:
Looking at the patterns in the given examples, I notice several key points:

1. Molecules with simple esters (R-O-C=O) tend to have property values around 26.3
   Examples: CC(C)CCOC=O and CCCCCOC(=O)C both have value 26.3

2. The molecule in question (CC(C)OC=O) is an isopropyl formate, which is a simple ester

3. The structure is very similar to other simple esters in the training set, particularly CC(C)CCOC=O, but with a shorter chain

4. The presence of the isopropyl group (CC(C)-) appears in several molecules in the training set, and doesn't seem to dramatically alter this particular property when compared to linear chains

Based on these observations, and particularly the consistent value of 26.3 for similar ester structures, I predict that the property value for CC(C)OC=O would be:

26.3

This prediction is primarily based on the structural similarity to other simple esters in the training set that consistently show this value.

Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 20.23
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a phenol derivative with:
- A phenol group (-OH)
- Two methyl groups (-CH3)
- A benzene ring core structure

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Simple phenol (c1ccccc1O) has a value of 20.23
2. Methylated aromatic compounds with single OH group tend to have values between 20-40
3. The presence of OH group consistently contributes to non-zero values
4. Multiple methyl substituents tend to slightly modify the base value
5. The position of substituents (meta in this case) also plays a role

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict a value of approximately 26.02 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's more complex than simple phenol (20.23)
- Has similar structural elements to methylated aromatics with OH groups
- The two methyl groups would modify the base phenol value
- The overall substitution pattern is similar to other methylated aromatic compounds in the training set

Therefore, my final prediction is 26.02 for this molecule.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 27.69
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

1. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)) similar to several examples
2. It has methoxy groups attached to the phosphorus
3. It has an aromatic ring with substituents
4. The substituents include a methylthio (SC) and methyl (C) groups

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has a value of 27.69
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has a value of 27.69
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a value of 27.69

I notice that all similar phosphorothioate compounds with the COP(=S)(OC)O- core structure have exactly the same value of 27.69, regardless of the different halogen substituents on the aromatic ring.

While our target molecule has different substituents (SC and C instead of halogens), the core structure and general electronic properties are similar enough that I would predict the same value.

Therefore, I predict the property value to be 27.69.

Based on these patterns, I predict the property value for "Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl" to be:

0.0

This prediction is based on the structural similarity to other polychlorinated biphenyls in the training set that consistently showed a value of 0.0.

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The molecule is larger than simple alkanes (which have 0)
2. It contains a nitro group which tends to increase the value
3. It's simpler than complex nitro compounds which have values >100
4. It's similar in complexity to some mid-range molecules in the training set

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobromobenzene, where fluorine and bromine are substituted on a benzene ring.

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple halogenated aromatics tend to have low values
2. Molecules with single or multiple halogens on benzene rings, like Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, show values close to 0.0
3. Single halogen substitutions like COc1cccc(Cl)c1 show values around 9.23

Key observations:

- It's also somewhat similar to monohalogenated aromatics which show low values
- The presence of both F and Br is similar to having Cl and Br in the training examples

Based on these patterns and the structural similarity to other halogenated aromatics in the training set, I would predict the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 to be:

0.0

This prediction is made because the molecule follows the pattern of simple halogenated aromatics which consistently show values at or very close to 0.0 in the training set.

2. Contains an alcohol (OH) group
3. Has multiple methyl substituents
4. Is relatively non-polar overall
5. Has a similar structural framework to some of the steroid-like molecules in the training set, but much simpler

Analyzing similar molecules from the training set:
- Simple alcohols like CC(C)(C)CO and CCCC(C)(C)O have values around 20.23
- More complex bicyclic/polycyclic structures with OH groups tend to have higher values
- The presence of OH groups generally contributes to higher values
- The molecule is less complex than the steroid derivatives which have values >90

Given these considerations, I would predict a property value of approximately 29.5 for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2.

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of one OH group
- The bicyclic nature of the molecule
- The relative simplicity compared to larger steroid structures
- The presence of multiple methyl groups
- The overall moderate polarity of the molecule

- Molecules with P=S and complex ring systems tend to have moderate values
- The presence of O=C-N groups often contributes to higher values
- Similar sized molecules with comparable functional groups show values in the 40-60 range

Considering these factors, and particularly noting the structural similarity to the training example (55.84) but with slightly less complexity (missing the CCl group), I would predict a value of approximately:

52.6

This prediction takes into account the structural similarities to known compounds while adjusting for the slight differences in molecular complexity and functional groups.

Iteration: 34
SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 26.93

2. Has a carbonyl group (C=O)
3. Contains two nitrogen atoms in the ring
4. Has a phenyl ring substituent

- Molecules containing N-phenyl substituents typically contribute to higher values
- The presence of carbonyl groups generally increases the property value
- Similar heterocyclic structures with aromatic substituents show values around 35-45

Based on these patterns and considering the structural similarities with molecules in the training set (particularly those containing heterocycles with C=O and N-phenyl groups), I would predict the property value to be approximately:

34.5

This prediction takes into account the molecule's similarity to other heterocyclic compounds in the training set, particularly those containing N-phenyl substituents and carbonyl groups, while considering its relatively compact structure compared to some of the larger molecules with higher values in the training set.

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 26.3
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCCCCC(=O)OCC is a simple ester with:
- A straight chain of 6 carbons on one side of the ester group
- An ethyl group on the other side of the ester group

- CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (a longer chain ester) also has value 26.3
- Other esters in the dataset tend to have values in the 20-30 range unless they have additional polar groups

Given that:
1. This molecule is a simple ester like the examples above
2. It has a similar structure to other esters in the training set
3. It lacks additional polar groups that might increase the value

The molecule in question (COC(=O)c1ccccc1) is methyl benzoate, a simple aromatic ester.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) has a value of 26.30
- Other simple esters show similar values around 26-30

The only difference between our target molecule and ethyl benzoate is that ours has a methyl ester instead of an ethyl ester, which is a minor change that shouldn't significantly affect the property.

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value to be:

26.30

This prediction is primarily based on the direct structural similarity to ethyl benzoate and the consistent pattern seen with similar ester compounds in the training set.

True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Looking at the patterns in the given examples, I notice several key trends:

1. Simple hydrocarbons (including aromatic compounds) without polar groups tend to have a value of 0.0
2. Molecules with alcohol (-OH) groups often have values around 20.23
3. More complex molecules with multiple polar groups tend to have higher values
4. The presence of aromatic rings alone doesn't necessarily lead to high values

For the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 (isopropylbenzene):
- It's a hydrocarbon
- Contains an aromatic ring
- Has no polar functional groups
- Similar in structure to other simple alkylbenzenes in the dataset like CCc1ccc(C)cc1 and CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1, which both have values of 0.0

Based on these observations, I predict the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 to be:

The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of:
- A benzene ring (c1ccccc1)
- An aldehyde group (O=C-H) attached to the ring

Looking at patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple aromatic hydrocarbons (like naphthalene derivatives) tend to have values of 0.0
2. Molecules with oxygen-containing groups typically have higher values
3. Single oxygen-containing groups (like in COc1ccccc1 = 9.23) tend to give lower values than multiple oxygen groups
4. Aldehydes and ketones typically show moderate values
5. The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) seems to contribute significantly to the property

Given that:
- This molecule has one oxygen in a carbonyl group
- It's similar in complexity to anisole (COc1ccccc1) which has a value of 9.23
- But the aldehyde group might be more contributory than a methoxy group

I would predict a property value of approximately 17.1 for benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1).

This prediction takes into account that aldehydes tend to have higher values than simple ethers, but lower than molecules with multiple oxygen atoms or more complex functional groups.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 24.06
Predicted Property:
Looking at the training examples and analyzing the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, I notice it's structurally similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 24.72. The only difference is that one has a double bond between the nitrogens (=N-) while our target molecule has a single bond (-NH-).

The presence of two phenyl rings connected by nitrogen atoms is maintained in both structures. Given that most aromatic compounds in the training set with similar complexity tend to have property values in the 20-30 range, and considering the very close structural similarity to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (24.72), I would predict the property value to be approximately:

24.72

This prediction is based on the observation that the change from a double bond to a single bond between nitrogens typically doesn't cause dramatic changes in this property, and the core structural features determining the property appear to be preserved.

- Other cyclic structures with multiple C=O groups tend to have values in the 50-80 range
- The presence of the cyclopentane ring might slightly reduce the value compared to similar structures

Taking all these factors into consideration, and noting that cyclic imides with similar structural features typically have values in the 65-75 range, I would predict the property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 to be approximately:

71.8

This prediction takes into account the structural similarity to other cyclic imides in the training set while considering the specific structural features of this molecule.

- The presence of sulfur-containing groups with oxygen (like in phosphorothioates) typically gives values in the 50-70 range
- Para-substituted benzenes with polar groups typically have values in the 60-75 range

Given these patterns and considering that:

Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the patterns, I notice that:

1. Molecules with multiple hydroxyl (-OH) groups, especially on aromatic rings, tend to have higher values
2. Molecules with fused ring systems containing oxygen and carbonyl groups also contribute to higher values

- Compounds with amide groups (NC(=O)) typically show values between 29-76
- Simpler molecules with P=O and N-C=O groups tend to have values in the 30-65 range

Considering these patterns and the relative simplicity of the target molecule compared to the training examples, while still containing several polar groups, I would predict a property value of:

6. Has similarities to some of the larger, more complex molecules in the training set

Looking at the training examples:
- Simple hydrocarbons and halogenated compounds tend to have values near 0
- Molecules with multiple oxygen-containing groups tend to have higher values
- Complex ring systems with multiple polar groups tend to have values in the 50-100 range
- The highest values are seen in molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and complex sugar-like structures (like the example with value 189.53)

Given that this molecule has:
- Multiple hydroxyl groups
- A sugar-like moiety
- Complex ring system
- Multiple oxygen-containing functional groups
- Similar structural complexity to some of the higher-valued examples

I would predict a property value of approximately 115.8 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account the molecule's structural complexity and the presence of multiple polar functional groups, while considering it's somewhat less polar than the highest-valued example in the training set.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 73.8
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, I notice:
1. It contains a heterocyclic ring structure with multiple nitrogen atoms
2. Has a thioether (CS-) group
3. Contains a carbonyl group (C=O)
4. Has a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)
5. Contains an N-N bond
6. Has structural similarities to some of the training examples with heterocyclic rings and nitrogen-containing functional groups

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Compounds with heterocyclic rings containing multiple N atoms typically have values between 65-75
- The presence of sulfur-containing groups often contributes to values around 20-30
- Compounds with tert-butyl groups and similar ring systems show values around 65-75

Based on these observations and the structural features, I would predict a property value of approximately 69.8 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account the molecule's similarity to other nitrogen-containing heterocycles in the training set, particularly those with multiple nitrogen atoms in the ring and bulky substituents.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 26.3
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate (an aromatic ester).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple hydrocarbons and halogenated compounds tend to have values close to 0
2. Aromatic compounds with oxygen-containing functional groups typically have values between 20-60
3. The complexity and number of polar groups increases the value
4. Esters in the training set (like CCCCCC(=O)OC and CCCCC(=O)OCC) have values around 26.3

This molecule has:
- An aromatic ring
- An ester group
- Similar structural features to other aromatic esters in the dataset

Based on these observations and the closest structural analogues in the training set, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

26.3

This prediction is based on:
1. The presence of the ester group (similar to other esters in the dataset)
2. The aromatic ring contribution
3. The overall molecular size and complexity being similar to other molecules with values in this range

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at CCCCCCCBr (1-bromoheptane):
1. It's a halogenated alkane
2. Similar to other simple halogenated compounds in the examples (like CI)
3. Looking at patterns in the training data:
   - Simple halogenated compounds (CI, Br-containing aromatics) tend to have values of 0.0
   - Long chain alkanes/alkenes without polar groups also tend toward 0.0
   - The molecule lacks polar groups like -OH, -NO2, -NH2 that tend to give higher values
   - It's similar in structure to CCCCCCC=C which has a value of 0.0

Based on these observations, particularly the similarity to other simple halogenated compounds and long-chain hydrocarbons in the training set, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be:

0.0

This prediction is supported by the consistent pattern of simple halogenated compounds and non-polar chain molecules showing values of 0.0 in the training set.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 20.23
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

CO (methanol) is a small alcohol molecule. Looking at the patterns in the training set:

1. Small, simple alcohols tend to have values around 20.23
   - CCC(C)CO (pentanol) = 20.23
   - OC1CCCCCC1 (cycloheptanol) = 20.23
   - CC(O)c1ccccc1 (1-phenylethanol) = 20.23

2. Very simple molecules without functional groups tend to have values of 0.0
   - CCC (propane) = 0.0
   - CC#C (propyne) = 0.0

3. Methanol (CO) is the simplest alcohol, containing just one carbon and one hydroxyl group. It follows the pattern of other simple alcohols, but being the smallest, it might have a slightly lower value than larger alcohols.

Based on these observations and the consistent pattern that simple alcohols show values around 20.23, I would predict that CO (methanol) would have a property value of:

20.23

This prediction is based on the clear pattern that simple alcohols consistently show this value in the training set, and methanol, while being the simplest alcohol, still contains the key hydroxyl functional group that appears to be associated with this property value.
