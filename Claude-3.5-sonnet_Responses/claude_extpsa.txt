SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns that can help predict the property value:

1. The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester with a long alkyl chain
2. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
   - CCOC(=O)CC (ethyl propionate) has value 0.0

Based on these observations, particularly the exact matches of similar esters having values of 0.0, I predict that the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be:

0.0

This prediction is made with high confidence given the consistent pattern of similar esters in the training set having this exact value.

Based on these observations and the general trends in the training data where:
- Complex ring systems tend to have moderate values
- Oxygen-containing functional groups tend to increase the value slightly

Based on these structural features and patterns from the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

2.8 to 3.2

My specific prediction would be: 2.95

This prediction takes into account:
- The positive contribution from the urea-like structure

- A CC=C group

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a value of 3.45223486

Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecular structure of "NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1", I notice several important patterns:

1. The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (-SO2-)
2. It has multiple nitrogen-containing groups (amine and amidine)
3. It has an aromatic ring with an amine substituent
4. The overall structure contains polar groups

Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:
- Molecules with sulfonamide groups tend to have higher values (like in the example "CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O" with value 4.40294556)
- Molecules with multiple polar groups and nitrogen atoms also tend to have higher values
- The presence of amine groups (-NH2) typically increases the value

Based on these observations and the structural similarities with other molecules in the training set, I would predict the property value for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 to be approximately:

5.2

This prediction takes into account the molecule's polarity, the presence of multiple nitrogen atoms, the sulfonamide group, and the overall structural complexity, which all tend to correlate with higher values in the training set.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 5.581814928130129
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule and the given examples, I'll make a prediction based on several key observations:

1. The molecule contains nitro groups (N(=O)=O), which tends to increase the property value (as seen in examples with nitro groups)
2. It has a trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which typically contributes to increased values
3. The structure contains an amine group (CCN) with some alkyl substitution
4. There are multiple electron-withdrawing groups on an aromatic ring

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with nitro groups typically have values between 2.0-4.0
- Complex substituted aromatics with electron-withdrawing groups tend to have higher values
- The presence of multiple strong electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and CF3) suggests a higher value

Based on these structural features and patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

2.85

This prediction takes into account the combined effects of the nitro groups, trifluoromethyl group, and the amine substitution, while considering the overall molecular complexity and electronic effects.

Iteration: 26
SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict the property value.

CC(C)OC=O is a formate ester (specifically isopropyl formate).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple esters (like CCOC(=O)C and CCCCCOC(=O)C) have values around 0.0
2. Small molecules with C=O groups tend to have values between -0.3 and 0.0
3. The molecule in question is structurally similar to CC(C)CCOC=O which has a value of 0.0

Given that:
- This is a small ester molecule
- It contains a formate group (OC=O)
- It's similar in size and functionality to other simple esters in the training set
- It has branching similar to some examples

I predict the property value would be approximately 0.0

This prediction is based on the clear pattern that simple esters in the training set consistently show values very close to 0.0, and this molecule fits that pattern well.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.19820115285127862
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and the target molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 (which is dimethylphenol), I can make the following analysis:

1. The molecule contains a phenol group (-OH on benzene ring), similar to simpler phenol (c1ccccc1O) which has a value of -0.19820115

2. It has two methyl groups (-CH3) on the benzene ring, which are electron-donating groups

3. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple phenol: -0.19820115
- Methylaniline (Cc1cccc(N)c1): -0.00983745
- Other substituted aromatics with OH groups tend to have values around -0.2 to 0.6

4. The presence of methyl groups typically causes a slight increase in the property value compared to the unsubstituted compound

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict the property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 to be approximately:

-0.10 to 0.00

My specific prediction would be: -0.05

This takes into account that:
- It's a phenol derivative (base value around -0.2)
- Has two electron-donating methyl groups (slight positive shift)
- Is relatively simple compared to molecules with very high values
- Shows similar structural features to molecules in the -0.2 to 0.0 range

The target molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is an organophosphate compound with similar structural features to several molecules in the training set, particularly:

1. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl (0.04989549)
2. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl (0.04989549)
3. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (0.04989549)

Key observations:
- All these similar compounds have the same COP(=S)(OC)O- core structure
- They all have a value of exactly 0.04989549
- The main difference is in the aromatic ring substituents
- The target molecule has SC and C substituents instead of halogens
- The substituent pattern is slightly different but maintains similar electronic effects

Given that all the similar phosphorothioate compounds in the training set have exactly the same value (0.04989549), and the changes in substituents (SC and C vs. halogens) are not likely to dramatically alter the property based on the patterns observed in other examples, I predict that this molecule will have a very similar value.

Predicted value: 0.04989549

1. This is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) structure
2. Similar highly chlorinated aromatic compounds in the training set tend to have a value of -0.67449076

   - "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" (-0.67449076)
   - "ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl" (-0.67449076)

These molecules share similar structural features with the target molecule - multiple chlorine substitutions on aromatic rings or connected ring systems. They consistently show the same property value.

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to other polychlorinated compounds in the training set, I predict the property value for "Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl" to be:

-0.67449076

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.7426361867889417
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O, which is propyl nitrite) by comparing it with the training examples and looking for patterns:

1. The molecule contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O), which appears in several training examples and tends to increase the property value
2. It has a short carbon chain (CCC), similar to simple alkanes in the training set
3. Looking at similar structures in the training set:
   - Simple alkanes (CCC) have values around -0.67
   - Molecules with nitro groups tend to have higher positive values
   - The size and complexity of the molecule is relatively small

Based on these observations and patterns from the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.9 to 1.2 for CCCN(=O)=O.

My specific prediction is: 1.10

This takes into account that:
- The nitro group typically increases the value significantly compared to plain hydrocarbons
- The molecule is relatively simple and small
- It's more complex than simple alkanes but less complex than the molecules with multiple nitro groups that have very high values

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples and analyzing the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, I can make the following observations:

1. It's a mono-fluorinated and mono-brominated benzene
2. The substituents are in meta position to each other
3. It's similar in structure to other halogenated aromatics in the training set, such as:
   - Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.67449076)
   - Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (similar pattern but with chlorines)

The molecule has:
- Similar size to other halogenated aromatics
- Similar electronic properties to other halogen-substituted benzenes
- No additional functional groups that might significantly alter the property

Based on these observations and the closest structural analogues in the training set, particularly considering the similarity to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 which has a value of -0.67449076, I would predict the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 to be approximately:

-0.67449076

This prediction is based on the very similar electronic and structural properties of the fluorine and chlorine substituents in aromatic systems, and the presence of the bromine substituent in both molecules.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.19820115285127862
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule and the given examples, I'll make a prediction based on the patterns I observe:

The target molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is:
- A bicyclic structure
- Contains an alcohol (OH) group
- Has multiple methyl substituents
- Is relatively small and compact
- Has no aromatic rings or complex functional groups
- Is fairly hydrophobic but has one polar OH group

Looking at the training examples and their values, molecules with:
- Simple alcohols tend to have values around -0.19 to 0.11
- More complex structures tend to have higher values
- Bicyclic structures often show slightly higher values than simple chains
- Presence of OH groups typically increases the value somewhat

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to some of the training examples, particularly other cyclic alcohols and bicyclic structures, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.44

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is more complex than simple alcohols (which have values around -0.19) but less complex than the highly functionalized steroids in the training set (which have values >6). The bicyclic nature and presence of the OH group suggests a moderate positive value.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 1.5578902920402156

2. The most similar compound in the training set is CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O with value 1.55789029
3. The target molecule is slightly simpler (lacks the CCl group) but maintains core structural features

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to known compounds, particularly the phosphorothioate-containing phthalimide derivative, I would predict a property value of approximately:

1.48

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly simpler than its closest analog in the training set, which would likely result in a slightly lower value while still maintaining similar chemical characteristics.

The target molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a heterocyclic compound with:
- A pyrazolone core structure
- Two methyl groups

- A carbonyl group

Looking at the training examples:
1. Molecules with heterocyclic structures containing N atoms and carbonyl groups tend to have positive values
2. Similar molecules with fused ring systems and N-containing heterocycles like O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23 have values around 0.70
3. The presence of C=O and N-phenyl substituents appears to contribute to moderate positive values

Based on these structural patterns and similarities to known examples, I predict the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C to be approximately:

0.65 to 0.75, with a best estimate of 0.70

This prediction takes into account the molecule's similarity to other N-heterocyclic compounds in the training set, particularly those with carbonyl groups and phenyl substituents.

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCCCCC(=O)OCC is a simple ester with:
- A straight chain of 6 carbons on one side of the ester group
- An ethyl group on the other side of the ester group
- Contains a C(=O)O (ester) functional group

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Simple esters like COC=O have values around 0.0
- CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (a longer chain ester) also has value 0.0
- Other esters with similar complexity tend to have values close to 0.0
- The presence of straight alkyl chains doesn't seem to dramatically affect the value

Based on these observations, particularly the consistency of simple ester compounds having values around 0.0, and the similarity to other examples in the training set, I would predict the property value for CCCCCC(=O)OCC to be:

0.0

This prediction is based on the strong pattern that simple ester compounds consistently show this value in the training set, and this molecule fits that pattern well.

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples and analyzing the new molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate), I can make a prediction based on several patterns I observe:

1. This molecule is structurally very similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) which has a value of 0.0

2. The only difference is that our target molecule has a methoxy (COC(=O)-) instead of ethoxy (CCOC(=O)-) group

3. Looking at other similar esters and aromatic compounds in the training set, we can see that small changes in the alkyl chain length don't typically cause dramatic changes in the property value

4. The molecule maintains the same core benzoate structure as several examples with values close to 0

Based on these observations, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.0

This prediction is based on:
- The very close structural similarity to ethyl benzoate
- The presence of similar functional groups in other molecules with comparable values
- The relatively minor structural modification (methyl vs ethyl) which typically doesn't cause large property changes in this dataset

   - Simple hydrocarbons like C1CCCC1 also have -0.67449076

Given that C=CCC=C is a simple hydrocarbon with a structure somewhat similar to CC/C=C/C, and considering that many simple hydrocarbons in the training set have the exact value of -0.67449076, I would predict:

Predicted value for C=CCC=C: -0.67449076

This prediction is based on the strong pattern observed where simple hydrocarbons consistently show this specific value in the training set.

1. Organophosphate structure with P=S
2. Multiple oxygen atoms
3. A chlorine atom

- Molecules containing chlorine and aromatic rings generally have values between -0.67 and 2.0
- Complex structures with multiple functional groups tend to have higher values
- The presence of cyclic structures and multiple heteroatoms tends to increase the value

Given these patterns and the structural similarity to some of the training examples, particularly the organophosphate compounds, I would predict a value of approximately:

1.2 to 1.5, with my best specific prediction being 1.35

This prediction takes into account the molecule's complexity, presence of P=S bond, chlorine atom, and cyclic structures, while noting it's not as complex as some of the very high-value compounds in the training set.

SMILES: Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl
True Property: 0.1160610597794856
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has:
- A phenoxy linkage between two aromatic rings
- Multiple chlorine substituents (3 Cl)
- A hydroxyl group (OH)
- Similar structural elements to some training examples, particularly the chlorinated phenols

Looking at relevant examples from the training set:

Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. The molecule CC/C=C\C is very similar to CC/C=C/C which has a value of -0.67449076
2. The only difference is the stereochemistry of the double bond (cis vs trans)
3. Looking through the training examples, I notice that:
   - Simple hydrocarbons often have the value -0.67449076
   - Stereochemistry differences in similar molecules don't seem to cause major property changes in the given examples

Given that:
1. The molecule is a simple hydrocarbon
2. It's identical to one of the example molecules except for stereochemistry
3. The property appears to be more dependent on functional groups than stereochemistry

I predict the property value for CC/C=C\C would be:

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.48743469322008653
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and the patterns in the training examples to make a prediction.

CCCOCC is a simple ether molecule (diethyl propyl ether).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple hydrocarbons (like C, CC#C, CCC#C) tend to have value around -0.67449076
2. Molecules with oxygen (especially alcohols) tend to have values around -0.19820115
3. Simple esters (like CC(C)COC(=O)C) have values around 0.0
4. More complex structures with multiple functional groups have higher positive values

CCCOCC is most similar to simple ethers and aliphatic compounds in the training set. While it contains an oxygen atom, it's not an alcohol or an ester. Its structure is relatively simple and aliphatic.

Based on these observations and the molecule's similarity to simple aliphatic compounds with a single oxygen, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.67449076

This prediction is based on the fact that the molecule is primarily aliphatic in nature, and the presence of the ether oxygen doesn't seem to significantly alter the property value in the training examples for similar simple structures.

- CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 (value: 0.70442805) - has similar N-phenyl and N-C(=O) groups
- Other molecules with aromatic rings and nitrogen-containing functional groups typically have values between 0.2 and 2.0

Based on these structural similarities and patterns, I predict the property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 to be approximately:

0.65

This prediction takes into account the molecule's similarity to other N-phenyl containing compounds and compounds with urea-like structures in the training set.

True Property: 0.10235925557942042
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict the property value.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is an N-acetyl brominated aniline derivative. Looking at the patterns in the training data:

1. Molecules with bromine substituents on benzene rings typically have values around -0.67 to -0.19
2. Molecules with amide groups (N-C=O) tend to have slightly higher values
3. Para-substituted aromatics with both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups show moderate positive values
4. Similar structures like Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of -0.19820115

Considering these factors:
- The presence of the acetamide group (electron-donating)
- The para-bromine substituent (electron-withdrawing)
- The overall conjugation and electronic effects
- The structural similarity to several training examples

I would predict a property value of approximately 0.44809815 for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1.

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has both polar and non-polar regions, and its property value should be higher than simple brominated aromatics but lower than highly functionalized compounds in the training set.

- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.67449076)
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.67449076)
- Cc1ccccc1 and other simple aromatic compounds tend to have values around -0.67449076

3. Key observations:
- Simple aromatic compounds with alkyl substituents consistently show values close to -0.67449076
- The presence of the branched alkyl chain (isopropyl-like group) doesn't seem to significantly alter this value based on similar examples

Based on these patterns and the structural similarity to other molecules in the training set, I predict that the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 would be:

-0.67449076

This prediction is made with high confidence as the molecule follows the pattern of simple aromatic compounds with alkyl substituents that consistently show this exact value in the training set.

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, consisting of:
- A benzene ring (c1ccccc1)
- An aldehyde group (O=C-H) attached to the ring

Looking at the patterns in the training set:
1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values around -0.67 to -0.48
2. Addition of oxygen-containing groups tends to increase the value
3. Aldehydes and similar carbonyl compounds show moderate positive values
4. The complexity and number of functional groups affects the magnitude

Considering these factors:
- The base benzene structure would suggest a negative value
- However, the aldehyde group will increase the value
- The molecule is relatively simple compared to many examples
- Similar structures with oxygen-containing groups show moderate positive values

Based on this analysis, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.28979861

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is more polar than simple aromatics but less functionalized than many of the higher-value compounds in the training set.

True Property: 13.085107541591107
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given training examples. Let me break down my thought process:

1. The molecule contains a furan ring (5-membered oxygen heterocycle) with a nitro group
2. It has a cyclic urea structure (hydantoin-like)
3. There's an imine linkage connecting these parts
4. The overall structure has multiple polar groups (C=O, NO2)
5. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - Molecules with nitro groups tend to have values around 1-2
   - Heterocyclic structures with multiple heteroatoms often have values > 0.5
   - The presence of multiple polar groups tends to increase the value

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 5.010728776184729
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is sulfanilamide, which has:
- An aniline structure (Nc1ccc...)
- A sulfonamide group (-S(N)(=O)=O)
- Para substitution pattern

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a value of 2.75212488
- Other molecules with nitro groups on aromatic rings tend to have values between 2-5
- Molecules with amino groups (-NH2) tend to increase the value
- Sulfonamide groups are somewhat similar to nitro groups in terms of electronic effects

Considering these factors:
1. The base aromatic structure is similar to the nitroaniline example
2. The sulfonamide group is slightly less electron-withdrawing than a nitro group
3. The presence of the amino group (-NH2) contributes to increasing the value

Based on these considerations, I would predict a value of approximately 2.45 for this molecule. This value is slightly lower than the nitroaniline example (2.75) because the sulfonamide group typically has a somewhat weaker electron-withdrawing effect than a nitro group.

Therefore, my predicted property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is 2.45

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -0.1957845181432913
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, I notice:

1. It contains a trifluoromethyl group (CF3)
2. Has a cyclic amide (lactam) structure
3. Contains two chlorine atoms
4. Has an aromatic ring
5. Contains a complex cyclic structure

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
- Molecules with halogen substituents (Cl, F) tend to have values around 0 to 3
- Presence of cyclic structures with nitrogen often increases the value
- Complex structures with multiple functional groups tend to have higher values
- Molecules containing both aromatic and aliphatic halogens typically show moderate positive values

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, particularly those with halogenated aromatics and cyclic amides, I would predict a value of approximately:

2.8

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of the CF3 group which typically contributes to moderate positive values
- The cyclic amide structure similar to some examples in the training set
- The presence of two chlorine atoms
- The overall complexity of the molecule
- The aromatic ring system with substituents

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.3081747041634069
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is a nitro-anisole (methoxybenzene with a nitro group).

Looking at patterns in the training examples:
1. Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have positive values (like the dinitrobenzene example which has 5.02712633)
2. Simple aromatic structures with single substituents tend to have lower values
3. The presence of oxygen-containing groups along with nitro groups seems to moderate the value somewhat
4. The molecule is relatively small and has both electron-donating (methoxy) and electron-withdrawing (nitro) groups

Considering these factors, and comparing with similar structures in the training set, particularly O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (5.02712633) but noting this molecule has only one nitro group and has a methoxy group instead of a second nitro group, I would predict a value of approximately:

2.1

This prediction takes into account that the value should be positive due to the nitro group but lower than the dinitrobenzene example due to having only one nitro group and the moderating effect of the methoxy substituent.

2. It's similar in some ways to other chlorinated compounds in the training set
3. Looking at other highly chlorinated compounds in the examples:
   - ClCCCl: -0.67449076
   - ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl: -0.67449076
   - Other simple chlorinated compounds also show similar values

The target molecule (ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl) is a complex polychlorinated structure, but based on the patterns in the training data:

1. Highly chlorinated compounds tend to have values around -0.67449076
2. The complexity of the ring structure doesn't seem to significantly alter this pattern
3. The presence of multiple chlorines appears to be the dominant factor

Based on these observations, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.67449076

This prediction is based on the consistent pattern seen with other chlorinated compounds in the training set, particularly the polychlorinated ones.

2. Molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups like alcohols often have values around -0.19820115
3. More complex molecules with multiple heteroatoms tend to have higher positive values
4. The presence of esters generally gives values between 0 and 2

For CCCOC=O (propyl formate):
- It's a relatively simple ester
- Has similar structural features to other simple esters in the training set
- Not as complex as molecules with very high positive values
- More functionalized than simple hydrocarbons with negative values
- Contains oxygen atoms in an ester group

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately 0.48 for CCCOC=O.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is a long-chain ester (specifically, a methyl ester of a fatty acid).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple hydrocarbons and halogenated compounds tend to have values around -0.67
2. Molecules with ester groups (C(=O)O) tend to have slightly higher values
3. The length of carbon chains seems to have a moderate influence
4. Oxygen-containing compounds generally have values higher than pure hydrocarbons
5. This molecule is relatively simple compared to the more complex structures that show very high values (>10)

Given that:
- It's an ester (which typically increases the value somewhat)
- It has a long hydrocarbon chain (which tends toward negative values)
- It's relatively simple in structure
- It lacks aromatic rings or complex functional groups

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.28979861

This prediction takes into account that similar relatively simple oxygen-containing compounds in the training set (like aldehydes and ethers) tend to have values in this range, and the molecule's structure suggests it would behave similarly.

1. A phenol group (Oc1)
2. Chlorine substituents
3. An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
4. A nitro group (N(=O)=O)

- Amide linkages generally contribute positively to the value
- The combination of polar groups (OH, NO2, C=O) tends to result in higher values

Given these structural features and their combined effects, and comparing with similar molecules in the training set (especially those with chloro, nitro, and amide functionalities), I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.85 to 0.95, with my best single prediction being 0.89

This value takes into account the combined effects of the electron-withdrawing groups (Cl, NO2), the hydrogen-bond donors/acceptors (OH, C=O, NH), and the overall molecular complexity.

1. Similar structures in the training set include:
- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (nitrotoluene) with value 0.74263619
- Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 (chloroaniline) with value -0.00983745
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (trichlorophenol) with value -0.19820115

1. The molecule contains multiple sugar-like units (cyclic structures with multiple OH groups)
2. It has a high oxygen content and multiple hydroxyl groups
3. It's structurally similar to carbohydrates and complex sugars
4. The molecule contains multiple cyclic ether linkages

Based on the training examples, I observe that:
- Molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and oxygen atoms tend to have higher positive values
- Simple sugars like C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O have values around 5-6
- More complex structures with multiple OH groups and nitrogen-containing groups can have values >10
- The target molecule is more complex than a simple sugar but follows similar structural patterns

Given these observations and the fact that this appears to be a complex carbohydrate-like structure with multiple sugar units and hydroxyl groups, I would predict a value of approximately:

6.8

This prediction is based on:
- The presence of multiple sugar-like units (which typically contribute to higher values)
- The high number of hydroxyl groups
- The structural similarity to other oxygen-rich molecules in the training set
- The complexity being greater than simple sugars but not containing other functional groups that might lead to extremely high values

- CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO (value: 6.5967167)

The target molecule shares structural similarities with these steroids, particularly the first one. However, it has some key differences:

3. The overall arrangement is slightly different

Given these considerations and the general trend in the training data where:
- More complex structures tend to have higher values

   - Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl
   - Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl
