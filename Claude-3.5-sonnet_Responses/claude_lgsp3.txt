SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.5768977871024343
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester of a long-chain fatty acid (methyl decanoate).

Looking at similar patterns in the training data:
1. CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl laurate) has a value of 0.6098437
2. Long chain alkanes like CCCCCC, CCCCCCC(C)C have values around 0.77764813
3. Shorter esters like CCOC(=O)CC have a value of 0.28701204
4. CCCCCCC(=O)C (ketone) has a value of 0.49296278

Given that:
- This molecule is slightly shorter than methyl laurate
- It has similar functional groups (ester)
- It's longer than the short chain esters
- The value should be between the long chain alkanes and shorter esters

I would predict a property value of approximately 0.55

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The presence of the ester group typically reduces the value compared to pure alkanes
2. Longer chain length tends to increase the value
3. The molecule is very similar to methyl laurate but slightly shorter

Therefore, my predicted value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is 0.55

   - Molecules with nitro groups like "Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO" have values around -1.20
   - Small molecules with electronegative groups tend to have negative values

Based on these patterns and the molecule's structural features, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-1.20069231

This prediction is based on:
1. The presence of the N(=O)=O group, which appears to decrease the property value
2. The similarity to other small molecules with nitrogen-oxygen functional groups in the training set
3. The general trend that molecules with polar groups tend to have negative values in this property scale

2) Looking at similar structures in the examples:
- CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C has a value of 0.31501908
- This is the most similar structure in the training set, also being a steroid-like molecule with ketone groups

3) The target molecule has:
- Additional oxygen (hydroxyl group)
- Similar carbon framework

True Property: -0.7691403623505102
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O has several key features:
1. A heterocyclic ring structure with two nitrogen atoms
2. Two carbonyl groups (C=O)
3. A bromine substituent

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples provided.

The molecule "c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2" is biphenyl - two benzene rings connected directly to each other.

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Similar conjugated aromatic systems tend to have values around -2 to -3

- 4 carbons in a chain
- A sulfur atom at the end
- No complex ring structures
- No functional groups besides the thiol
- Similar in size/complexity to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:

- Simpler molecules generally have values between -0.2 and 0.8
- The most similar molecules structurally in the training set are the straight-chain compounds

Based on these observations and patterns, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.21925028

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's a relatively simple molecule (suggesting a moderate positive value)
2. The presence of sulfur likely reduces the value somewhat compared to pure hydrocarbons
3. The value should be in line with other straight-chain molecules of similar size

CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with:
- A primary alcohol group (-OH)
- Two methyl branches
- A butyl chain backbone

Looking at similar structures in the training set:

True Property: -0.38779800596564235
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the molecule "Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1" (methylnaphthalene), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1. This molecule is structurally similar to several examples in the training set, particularly:
- "Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1" (methylanthracene, -0.27273336)
- "Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12" (dimethylnaphthalene, -0.83011789)

2. The target molecule is simpler than these examples (has fewer rings than methylanthracene and fewer methyl groups than dimethylnaphthalene)

3. Looking at the pattern of values:
- Simple aromatic systems tend to have values closer to 0
- Adding methyl groups to aromatic systems generally leads to negative values
- The values for similar naphthalene derivatives are in the range of -0.3 to -0.8

Based on these observations, I would predict the property value for methylnaphthalene (Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1) to be approximately:

-0.55

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's a naphthalene system (less complex than anthracene)
- It has one methyl group (less than dimethylnaphthalene)
- The value should be negative (based on similar structures)
- It should be less negative than dimethylnaphthalene (-0.83011789)

True Property: -0.5968971048639847
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the given examples.

The target molecule is a barbiturate derivative with a branched alkyl substituent and an alkene group. Looking at the training examples, I notice:

1. There's a similar core structure in the example "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C" which has a value of -3.90742738

2. The main difference is that our target molecule has a larger alkyl substituent (C(C)CCC) instead of just a methyl group

3. Both molecules share the same barbiturate core and CC=C terminal group

4. Generally, in the examples, larger alkyl substituents tend to make values less negative, but the barbiturate core seems to be associated with strongly negative values

Given these observations, I would predict the property value to be approximately -3.65 to -3.75.

My specific prediction is: -3.70214569

This prediction is slightly less negative than the similar example molecule because of the larger alkyl substituent, but still maintains a strongly negative value due to the barbiturate core structure.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which has:
- A benzene ring (phenyl group)
- A CF3 (trifluoromethyl) substituent

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values around 0 to -1
2. Halogenated aromatics (like Clc1ccc(I)cc1) often have values close to 0
3. Substituted benzenes generally show negative values
4. The presence of fluorine isn't directly shown in examples, but other halogens (Cl, Br, I) tend to push values toward 0

Considering these factors:
- The molecule has a simple aromatic structure (like many examples)
- It contains halogen substituents (similar to some examples showing values near 0)
- It's a mono-substituted benzene, but with a more electronegative substituent than most examples

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately -0.2 for this molecule.

   - Similar oxygen content
   - Similar molecular size
   - Similar polarity characteristics

Given these similarities and the fact that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and sugar-like structures in the training set tend to have values around 0.77764813, I predict that the property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O would be:

0.77764813

3. Has multiple ring systems
4. Contains several chiral centers
5. Has conjugated ketone system

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C (value: 0.42782434)
- CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C (value: 0.33997362)

These are the most similar structures as they share the basic steroid skeleton. The target molecule has additional functional groups (acetate, additional ketone) compared to these examples, but maintains the same core structure.

Based on the structural similarities and the observed values for related compounds, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.38 (±0.05)

This prediction takes into account that the additional functional groups might slightly modify the property value compared to the similar structures in the training set, but the core steroid skeleton likely dominates the overall property behavior.

3. Key observations:
   - Both molecules have similar complex ring systems
   - Both have hydroxyl (-OH) groups
   - Both have similar carbon frameworks

   - The presence of oxygen-containing groups seems to push values in this range
   - The structural similarity to CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O is particularly relevant

Given these considerations, I predict the property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O would be approximately:

-0.18437602

This prediction is based primarily on the very close structural similarity to the known steroid example in the training set, as they share the same basic framework and similar functional groups.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple phenols like "c1ccccc1O" have a value of 0.0
- Molecules with methyl substituents and single hydroxyl groups tend to have values between -1.2 and -2.8
- The complexity and substitution pattern is most similar to "Cc1cccc(N)c1" (-0.67449076) and "c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC" (-1.20069231)

Given that this molecule:

1. It contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S))
2. It has methoxy groups (OC) attached to phosphorus
3. It has an aromatic ring with methylthio (SC) and methyl (C) substituents
4. The overall structure is similar to several organophosphate/organothiophosphate compounds in the training set

- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has a value of -1.59121523

These very similar structures all have exactly the same value (-1.59121523), and they differ from our target molecule mainly in the substituents on the aromatic ring (Cl/Br/I vs. SC/C).

Given the strong structural similarity and the consistent pattern in the training data, I predict that the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 would be:

-1.59121523

This prediction is based on the observation that compounds with this basic phosphorothioate structure consistently show this value in the training set, regardless of minor variations in the aromatic ring substituents.

0.0

This prediction is made with high confidence due to the consistent pattern seen with similar chlorinated aromatic compounds in the training set.

2. Similar molecules in the training set with nitro groups tend to have negative values
3. The base chain is a propyl group (CCC-), which when seen alone tends to have positive values around 0.77
4. The nitro group typically reduces the value significantly
5. Looking at molecules of similar size and with similar functional groups in the training set

Based on these observations and patterns, particularly considering:
- The presence of the nitro group which tends to decrease values
- The short carbon chain which typically contributes to positive values
- The overall molecular size and complexity

I would predict a value of approximately -0.65 for this molecule.

3. The most similar structure (Clc1ccc(Br)cc1) has exactly 0.0

Given that F and Br substitution pattern is similar to the Cl-Br example in the training set, and considering that fluorine and chlorine often have similar effects in these types of properties, I would predict:

Predicted value: 0.0

This prediction is based on the high structural similarity to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 which has exactly this value, and the general pattern of dihalogenated benzenes in the dataset.

2. Cyclic structures tend to have values closer to 0
3. Complex bicyclic structures with OH groups (like some steroids in the training set) have values around 0.1-0.4

Given that this molecule:
- Has a hydroxyl group (like the alcohols that show 0.77764813)
- Is a bicyclic structure (which tends to reduce the value compared to linear alcohols)
- Has structural similarity to some of the steroid-like molecules in the training set
- Is simpler than the steroid structures that showed values around 0.1-0.4

I would predict a value of approximately 0.44676617 for this molecule.

1. This molecule is structurally very similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) which has a value of -1.28607547

2. The only difference is that our target molecule has a methoxy (COC(=O)-) group instead of an ethoxy (CCOC(=O)-) group

3. Looking at other similar esters in the dataset, they consistently show values around -1.28 to -1.3

4. The presence of the benzoate group (C(=O)c1ccccc1) appears to be a key structural feature determining the property value

Given these observations, and particularly the very close structural similarity to ethyl benzoate, I would predict that COC(=O)c1ccccc1 would have a property value of:

-1.28607547

This prediction is based on the nearly identical structure to ethyl benzoate, with the minor change in the alkyl group likely having minimal impact on this particular property.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.7776481338173168
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) by comparing it to the training examples and looking for patterns.

Key observations:
1. The molecule is very small and symmetric
2. It contains two chlorine atoms bonded to a single carbon
3. It's similar in size and composition to some of the simpler molecules in the training set
4. Looking at other chlorinated compounds in the training set, they tend to have values around 0.0
5. Small, simple halogenated molecules in the training set generally don't show extreme values

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, particularly looking at similar small halogenated compounds and the fact that many chlorinated aromatics have values of 0.0, I would predict the property value for ClCCl to be:

0.0

This prediction is based on:
- The molecule's structural similarity to other simple chlorinated compounds in the dataset
- The tendency of chlorinated compounds to have values around 0.0
- The molecule's small size and symmetry
- The absence of any functional groups that tend to give extreme values in the training set

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (exact same number of chlorines, just different positions) has a value of 0.0
2. Other halogenated compounds like Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 also have a value of 0.0
3. Simple aromatic compounds with electronegative substituents tend to have values close to 0.0

Given that:
- The molecule has the same number of chlorines as the very similar reference compound
- The positioning of the chlorines is slightly different but maintains a similar electronic effect
- The hydroxyl group is in the same position
- The overall molecular size and shape is nearly identical

Based on these observations, especially the exact structural similarity to the first reference compound, I would predict the property value to be:

0.0

This prediction is made with high confidence due to the presence of a very close structural analog in the training set with the same value.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -0.7947681266421731
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the given molecule, I notice:
1. It's a complex natural product-like structure
2. Contains multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters)
3. Has a methylenedioxy group (OCO)
4. Contains multiple rings including aromatic rings
5. Has hydroxyl groups
6. Has a complex glycosidic linkage

Analyzing the training examples:
- Simple aliphatic molecules tend to have values around 0.77764813
- Complex ring systems with multiple oxygens tend to have values between -1 and -2
- Highly conjugated aromatics often have values close to 0
- Natural product-like structures with multiple rings and oxygens tend to have values between -1 and -2

Given the structural complexity and similarity to other complex oxygenated natural product-like molecules in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

-1.59121523

This prediction is based on the molecule's similarity to other complex structures in the training set with multiple oxygen-containing functional groups and fused ring systems.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.374560676490217
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, I notice:
1. It contains a heterocyclic ring structure with multiple nitrogen atoms
2. It has a thioether (CSc-) group
3. It contains a carbonyl group (c(=O))
4. It has a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)
5. It has an amino substituent (-N)

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings and nitrogen atoms tend to have values around -0.2 to -1.0
- The presence of sulfur-containing groups often contributes to slightly more negative values
- Molecules with similar complexity and mixed functionalities typically fall in the range of -0.3 to -0.8

Based on these observations and the structural similarities with molecules like:
CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C (-0.04980785)
CCNc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(OC)n1 (-0.18437602)

I would predict the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C to be approximately:

-0.31

This prediction takes into account the structural similarities with other heterocyclic compounds in the training set while considering the specific substituents present in this molecule.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -1.2860754684033593
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate (an aromatic ester).

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple aliphatic molecules often have values around 0.77
2. Aromatic compounds with oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have values between -1.5 and 0.5
3. Esters in the training set (like CCCCCC(=O)OC and CCCCC(=O)OCC) have values around 0.44676617

Given that this molecule:
- Contains an aromatic ring (benzene)
- Has an ester group
- Is similar in structure to other esters in the training set
- Is relatively simple compared to many of the more complex structures

I predict the property value would be approximately 0.44676617

This prediction is based on the similarity to other ester compounds in the training set and the general patterns observed in the molecular features and their corresponding values.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.7776481338173168
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCCCBr, 1-bromoheptane) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Simple linear alkyl halides tend to have positive values
2. Molecules with similar chain lengths (7-8 carbons) and single functional groups show values around 0.4-0.8
3. The presence of bromine (Br) in aromatic compounds in the examples shows values close to 0
4. Linear aliphatic compounds with similar length (like CCCCCCCO) show values around 0.77

Given that CCCCCCCBr is:
- A linear alkyl chain
- Contains 7 carbons
- Has a single bromine terminal group
- Similar in structure to CCCCCCCO but with Br instead of OH

I predict the property value would be approximately 0.77764813

This prediction is based on the structural similarity to other linear molecules in the training set, particularly the similar-length alcohols and alkyl compounds, and considering that bromine substitution in this case would likely have a similar effect to other terminal functional groups in linear chains.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 0.7776481338173168
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and the patterns in the training examples to make a prediction.

CO (methanol) is a very simple molecule with:
- One carbon atom
- One oxygen atom (alcohol group)
- Similar in simplicity to molecules like CCC (propane) which has value 0.77764813
- Similar functional group to molecules like CCC(C)CO (2-methylbutan-1-ol) which also has value 0.77764813
- Other simple alcohols in the training set also tend to have this same value

Looking at the patterns:
1. Simple molecules with alcohol (-OH) groups often have the value 0.77764813
2. This value appears repeatedly for simple aliphatic molecules with polar groups
3. The molecule CO is one of the simplest alcohols possible

Based on these observations and the consistent pattern of simple alcohols having the value 0.77764813 in the training set, I predict that CO (methanol) would have a property value of:

0.77764813

This prediction is based on the clear pattern seen with other simple alcohols and aliphatic molecules in the training set.
