SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.7551473960638355
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester of a long-chain fatty acid (methyl decanoate).

Looking at similar structures in the examples:
- CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl dodecanoate) has a value of 1.81193603
- Other long-chain aliphatic compounds show increasing values with chain length
- The presence of the ester group (C(=O)OC) contributes to a moderate increase in the property

The target molecule has:
- A long aliphatic chain (10 carbons)
- An ester functional group
- Similar polarity characteristics to the example compounds

Considering that this molecule is slightly shorter than the C12 ester example (which has value 1.81193603), and following the general trend where shorter chains have lower values, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

1.55

This prediction takes into account:
- The slightly shorter chain length compared to the C12 ester
- The presence of the ester group
- The overall molecular size and polarity
- The general trends observed in the training set for similar structures

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.09866057817518414
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples.

The molecule "c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2" is biphenyl - two benzene rings connected directly to each other.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have negative or small positive values
2. Molecules with aromatic rings generally have higher values than their aliphatic counterparts
3. The complexity and number of rings seem to correlate with higher values
4. Biphenyl is relatively simple compared to many of the larger polycyclic compounds in the examples

- Similar in complexity to molecules like CCCCCC(C)C (-0.23747976) but with S instead of C
- Simpler than most molecules in the dataset
- Most structurally similar to simple alkanes and thiols in the set

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict the property value for CCCCS to be approximately:

-0.45

Based on these observations and the general trends in the dataset where:
- Alcohols tend to have values in the negative range
- Branching tends to make values less negative
- Similar sized molecules have comparable values

I predict the property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO to be approximately:

-0.52

This prediction takes into account that it should be:

3. The molecule has:
- A fused ring system (naphthalene core)
- One methyl substituent
- No polar groups
- Similar size and complexity to the simpler examples

4. Looking at the patterns in the data:

Based on these considerations and particularly the close structural similarity to "Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12" but with one less methyl group, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.15 to 0.25

My specific prediction would be 0.21

This value takes into account that it should be:
- Higher than simple benzene (-0.77674475)
- Lower than the anthracene derivative (0.63072987)
- Close to but slightly higher than the dimethylnaphthalene (-0.01396625) due to having one less methyl group affecting the electronic properties

1) The given molecule is a barbiturate derivative with:
- A cyclic urea core (barbituric acid structure)
- An alkyl substituent (C(C)CCC)
- A CC=C group

2) Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a value of -0.23212192
- This is the most similar structure, differing only by having a larger alkyl group

3) Analyzing the patterns:
- Larger alkyl chains tend to increase the value slightly
- The core barbituric acid structure contributes to keeping the value negative
- The CC=C group's contribution appears consistent

4) Considering these factors:
- The base structure should behave similarly to the reference compound
- The larger alkyl group will increase the value slightly, but not dramatically

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.15

This prediction takes into account that the larger alkyl substituent would make it slightly less negative than the reference compound (-0.23212192), but the core structure would maintain the overall negative character of the property.

1. The target molecule is a steroid-like structure with multiple rings (4 rings)
2. It contains an oxygen (hydroxyl group) and a ketone group
3. It's similar in complexity to other steroid-like structures in the training set, particularly CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O which had a value of 5.06853283

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.8042836084713485
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (isopropyl formate, CC(C)OC=O) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a small molecule with a formate ester group
2. Similar in size to molecules like CC(C)O (isopropanol, -0.88345001)
3. Contains an oxygen-containing functional group like many of the lower-value examples
4. Similar to CCOC=C (-0.84531613) in terms of oxygen linkage and size
5. Structurally related to other small esters and oxygenated compounds in the dataset
6. Most small, oxygenated molecules in the training set have negative values
7. The branching pattern (isopropyl group) is similar to other branched molecules with negative values

Based on these observations and patterns, particularly comparing to similar small oxygenated molecules and esters in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.65

This prediction takes into account that:
- Small oxygenated molecules tend to have negative values
- The presence of branching (isopropyl group) slightly modifies the value
- Similar molecules with ester groups show comparable ranges
- The molecule's size and complexity align with other examples having values in this range

SMILES: O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2
True Property: 0.47732415474993334
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

The target molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 is a urea derivative with two phenyl rings connected through a urea linkage.

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Simple aromatic compounds tend to have values between -0.8 and -0.2
2. Molecules with urea linkages (N-C(=O)-N) tend to have slightly positive values
3. When there are two phenyl rings connected by a functional group, the values tend to be closer to zero or slightly positive
4. The presence of N-H groups and C=O groups typically pulls the value slightly negative

Considering these factors:
- The molecule has two phenyl rings (which would contribute to a more positive value)
- It has a urea linkage (which tends to give slightly positive values)
- It has N-H groups and a C=O group (which would pull slightly negative)
- The overall structure is relatively symmetric

Based on similar structures in the training set and these considerations, I would predict a value of approximately:

SMILES: C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13
True Property: 0.1990289702579145
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and the target molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (which is fluorene), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1) The molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with three fused rings
2) It's similar in structure to some of the examples containing fused aromatic rings
3) Looking at similar structures in the training set:
   - c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 (pentacene fragment) has value 1.60790108
   - Simple aromatics tend to have values between -1 and 1
   - The complexity and size of the molecule suggests a moderate positive value

Based on these patterns and the structural similarity to other fused ring systems, I would predict the property value for fluorene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13) to be approximately:

0.35

This prediction takes into account that:
1) It's less complex than pentacene (which had 1.61)
2) It's more complex than simple benzene derivatives (which had negative values)
3) The fused ring system typically contributes to a positive value
4) The molecule has moderate size and complexity

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: 0.5506374516847926
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, I notice:
1. It contains a sulfonamide group -S(=O)(=O)-
2. Has an amidine group -C(=N)N-
3. Contains a para-substituted benzene ring
4. Has multiple amino groups (-NH2)
5. Is relatively polar due to multiple N atoms and the sulfonyl group
6. Has a moderate molecular size

Comparing to the training examples:
- Most highly polar molecules with multiple heteroatoms show values between 0 and 3
- Molecules with sulfonamide groups tend to have values around 2-3
- The presence of amino groups tends to decrease the value
- The size is moderate, not contributing to extremely high values like long alkyl chains

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

1.42

This prediction takes into account the molecule's polarity, size, and functional groups while comparing it to similar structures in the training set.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.8671640619638965
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

1. It contains nitro groups (N(=O)=O)
2. Has a trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F)
3. Contains an alkene group (C=C)
4. Has a tertiary amine structure
5. Contains a substituted benzene ring

Analyzing similar structures from the training set:

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.8042836084713485
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, a relatively simple ester.

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Small molecules generally have negative values
2. Molecules with C=O (carbonyl) groups often have values around -0.5 to -0.8
3. Similar structures like CC(C)CCOC=O has a value of -0.57498192
4. Simple esters tend to have negative values
5. The presence of oxygen atoms and carbonyl groups tends to make values more negative
6. The molecule size and complexity is similar to other molecules with negative values

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to CC(C)CCOC=O (-0.57498192), but being slightly smaller, I would predict the property value for CC(C)OC=O to be approximately:

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.535417881009983
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a dimethyl phenol:
- It has a benzene ring as the core structure
- Contains two methyl (C) substituents
- Has one hydroxyl (O) group
- It's a relatively simple aromatic structure

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Simple phenol (c1ccccc1O) has a value of -0.74840423
- Methylated aromatics like CCc1ccccc1C have values around -0.38997817
- Other simple substituted aromatics tend to have values between -0.7 and -0.2
- The hydroxyl group tends to make the values more negative
- Multiple methyl groups tend to make the values slightly less negative

Considering these patterns, and that this molecule is:
- More substituted than simple phenol
- Has similar polarity to the reference compounds
- Contains similar functional groups
- Is of similar molecular weight range

I predict the property value would be approximately: -0.45

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a value:

True Property: 5.889114067377353
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples and analyzing the given molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, I notice several patterns:

1. This molecule contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)) similar to several high-value examples
2. It has methoxy groups (OC) attached to the phosphorus
3. It contains an aromatic ring with substituents
4. The structure is similar to other organophosphate/organothiophosphate compounds in the training set

Looking specifically at similar structures:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a value of 4.01979966
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has a value of 5.02840833
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has a value of 5.83265494

The target molecule has the same basic phosphorothioate scaffold but with SC (methylthio) and C (methyl) substituents instead of halogens. These substituents are generally less electronegative than halogens, which would likely result in a somewhat lower value than the chlorinated/brominated/iodinated analogs.

Based on these considerations, I would predict a value of approximately 3.8 for this molecule.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 1.952686501444337
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the training examples.

The target molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has several key characteristics:
1. It's a biaryl system (two benzene rings connected)
2. Contains 5 chlorine atoms
3. Has structural similarity to some of the training examples, particularly the polychlorinated biphenyls

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (6 Cl atoms) has value 2.67890972
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (7 Cl atoms) has value 3.58127337

The target molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than both reference molecules (5 vs 6-7)
- Similar biaryl core structure
- Slightly different chlorine arrangement pattern

Based on these observations and the general trends in the training data where:
- More chlorines tend to increase the value
- Biaryl systems tend to have values in the 2-4 range
- The specific arrangement affects the final value

I predict the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl to be approximately:

2.45

This prediction takes into account that it should be lower than the 6-chlorine example (2.67) but still significant due to its biaryl nature and multiple chlorine substituents.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7990917444403222
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCN(=O)=O, propyl nitrite) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a nitro group
2. It has a short carbon chain (3 carbons)
3. Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
   - Simple alkanes (CCC) have values around -0.88
   - Molecules with nitro groups (NO2) tend to increase the value
   - Small molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups often have values between -1 and 0

Considering these factors:
- The base propyl chain would suggest a negative value (like propane at -0.88)
- The nitro group will increase this value somewhat
- The molecule's size and complexity is relatively low
- Similar small molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups in the training set tend to have values in the -0.6 to -0.2 range

Based on these considerations and patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCCN(=O)=O to be approximately:

-0.45

This prediction takes into account both the structural features and the general trends observed in the training set while considering the relative impact of the nitro group on similar molecules.

True Property: -0.5240828504208642
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobromobenzene, where fluorine and bromine are substituted at different positions on the benzene ring.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a value of -0.39647216 (similar dihalogenated benzene)
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (through COc1cccc(Cl)c1) shows similar meta-substitution pattern
- Other halogenated aromatics generally show values in the -0.3 to -0.5 range

Considering that:
1. Fluorine is smaller and more electronegative than chlorine
2. Bromine is present in both our target molecule and some training examples
3. The meta-substitution pattern is similar to some training examples
4. Most simple halogenated aromatics in the training set have negative values

I would predict the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 to be approximately:

True Property: 0.23143161173141066
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, I notice:
1. It's a bicyclic structure
2. Contains an OH group
3. Has multiple methyl substituents
4. Contains only C, H, and O atoms
5. Has a relatively compact, rigid structure

Analyzing similar molecules from the training set:
- Molecules with OH groups tend to have moderate negative to moderate positive values
- Bicyclic structures generally contribute to slightly higher values
- The complexity is moderate compared to some of the larger examples
- It's less complex than the steroids in the training set which had very high values
- It's more complex than simple alcohols which had negative values

Considering these factors and comparing to the most structurally similar molecules in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account that:
- It's more complex than simple alcohols like CC(C)(C)CO (-0.74064278)
- Less complex than steroid-like structures (which had values >10)
- Has similar structural elements to some moderate-valued bicyclic compounds
- The OH group and compact structure suggest a moderate positive value

True Property: 6.294245028094351
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples and my understanding of molecular structures.

Looking at the test molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, I notice:

1. It's structurally very similar to CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O from the training set (which has a value of 28.02989825)
2. The main difference is the absence of the SC(CCl) group in the test molecule
3. It maintains the phosphorothioate group (P=S) and the phthalimide ring system
4. The overall molecular weight and complexity is slightly lower than the similar training example

Given these observations:
- The removal of the SC(CCl) group would reduce the overall value
- The core structure maintaining the phosphorothioate and phthalimide would still contribute significantly
- The molecule maintains similar electronic properties

Based on these factors, I would predict a property value of approximately 22.4

This prediction takes into account that the removal of the SC(CCl) group would reduce the value by roughly 20-25% compared to the similar training molecule, while maintaining the core structural features that appear to contribute significantly to the property value.

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCC(=O)OCC - hexyl propionate) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Longer chain esters tend to have values around 0 to 0.4
2. Simple aliphatic compounds with oxygen-containing functional groups often have values between -1 and 1
3. The molecule in question is an ester with a medium-length carbon chain
4. Similar structures like CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl nonanoate) has a value of 0.37192072

Considering these factors:
- The molecule has a similar ester group
- It has a slightly shorter carbon chain than the methyl nonanoate example
- It lacks any complex structural features that might lead to extreme values
- Its polarity and size are moderate

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCCCCC(=O)OCC to be approximately:

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Similar structures like CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) has a value of -0.32248511
2. The molecule in question differs only by having a methoxy (COC=O) instead of ethoxy (CCOC=O)
3. Generally, shorter chain esters tend to have slightly more negative values
4. The presence of the benzoate group (C(=O)c1ccccc1) appears to keep values in a moderate negative range
5. Simple aromatic structures with single functionalization tend to have values between -0.3 and -0.7

Based on these observations, particularly comparing with ethyl benzoate and considering the slightly smaller size of the methyl group, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.35

This prediction takes into account that methyl benzoate should have a value slightly more negative than ethyl benzoate (-0.32248511) due to its smaller size, but not dramatically different as the core structure remains very similar.

- Has the same carbon count as pent-2-ene
- Contains two double bonds instead of one
- Is a simple, linear hydrocarbon
- Has no complex functional groups
- Is slightly more unsaturated than the similar examples

I predict the property value would be approximately: -0.73

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.7713740394466363
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I notice this molecule is a geometric isomer (Z-isomer) of CC/C=C/C (E-isomer) which has a known property value of -0.77137404.

The molecule CC/C=C\C is pent-2-ene with a Z configuration.

- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-)
- A para-brominated benzene ring
- Similar structural elements to several molecules in the training set

Looking at similar structures in the examples:
- Molecules with bromine on benzene rings tend to have values around -0.5 to 0.2
- Molecules with simple substituents on benzene rings often have values between -0.6 and 0.0
- The presence of an amide group typically doesn't drastically alter the value range
- Similar aromatic compounds with polar substituents tend to fall in this range

Considering these patterns and the specific combination of features in this molecule, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.32

This prediction takes into account:
1. The moderate electron-withdrawing effect of the bromine
2. The polar amide group
3. The overall molecular size and complexity
4. The similarity to other aromatic compounds in the training set

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.21249355451049493
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, which is isobutylbenzene) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a benzene ring with an isobutyl substituent
2. Similar compounds in the training set include:
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethyltoluene): -0.39217674
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (p-cymene): -0.23977292
- Cc1cccc2ccccc12 (methylnaphthalene): -0.21506593
- Simple benzene derivatives generally have values between -0.2 and -0.6

The molecule is most similar to p-cymene (CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1), but with the branching point one carbon further from the ring. This should make it slightly more lipophilic than ethylbenzene but similar to p-cymene.

Based on these comparisons and the general trends in the dataset, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.28

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The value should be negative (like most simple aromatics in the set)
2. The branched alkyl chain will make it slightly less negative than simpler benzene derivatives
3. It should be in the same range as similar aromatic compounds with alkyl substituents

- Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1 (-0.49317217)
- Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 (-0.49122827)

Given that bromine substituents typically lead to slightly higher values than chlorine, and considering the symmetry and aromatic nature of the molecule, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.15

This takes into account that the molecule is simpler than the biphenyl derivatives but has heavier halogens than the chlorinated examples, placing it in an intermediate range.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 2.6689922164243396
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns:

1. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms (Cl) attached to aromatic rings tend to have higher positive values
2. The most similar molecule in the training set is "Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" with a value of 7.7046527
3. The target molecule has a similar structure but fewer chlorine atoms (6 Cl atoms vs 10 Cl atoms in the reference)
4. The basic biphenyl core structure is maintained in both molecules

Given these observations:
- The target molecule should have a positive value
- The value should be lower than 7.7046527 due to fewer chlorine substituents
- The biphenyl core contribution should be similar
- The relationship between number of chlorines and property value appears somewhat linear

Based on this analysis, I would predict a value of approximately 4.8 for the target molecule.

This prediction takes into account that the property value should be:
- More than half but less than 2/3 of the reference molecule's value
- Reflects the contribution of 6 chlorines instead of 10
- Maintains the base contribution of the biphenyl core structure

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 11.583551161010782
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and the target molecule, I can analyze several patterns:

1. The molecule contains phosphate group (P=O) with aromatic substituents, which tends to increase the property value significantly
2. It has multiple aromatic rings with methyl substituents
3. The structure is relatively large and complex
4. Similar molecules with phosphate/phosphorothioate groups (like CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC) show higher values (>10)
5. However, this molecule is less complex than some of the very high-value steroids in the training set

Considering these factors:
- The presence of P=O group with three aromatic substituents suggests a relatively high value
- The molecule is moderately complex but not as complex as the highest-value examples
- The methyl substituents and aromatic rings contribute to a moderate increase
- The structure is somewhat similar to some phosphate-containing compounds in the training set

Based on these considerations and patterns in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

4.8

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has features that tend to increase the property value (phosphate group, aromatic rings) but isn't as complex as the compounds showing the highest values in the training set.

True Property: 1.9762928530019404
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the target molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, I notice:

1. It contains a trifluoromethyl group (CF3)
2. Has a benzene ring
3. Contains a cyclic amide (lactam) structure
4. Has two chlorine atoms
5. Overall complex structure with multiple functional groups

Analyzing similar structures from the training set:
- Molecules with halogen substituents (Cl, F) tend to have higher positive values
- Cyclic amide structures (like in O=C1N(C2CCC(=O)NC2=O)C(=O)c3ccccc13) contribute to positive values
- Complex ring systems with halogens typically show values between 1-3
- The presence of CF3 groups often increases the value

Considering these factors and the overall structural complexity, I would predict a value of approximately:

2.45

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of multiple halogens (2 Cl atoms + CF3 group)
- The cyclic amide structure
- The overall molecular complexity
- The aromatic system
- The relative size of the molecule

This value falls within the range seen for similarly complex halogenated structures in the training set.

Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (2-nitroanisole/2-methoxynitrobenzene) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have values around -0.5 to 0
2. Benzene derivatives with simple substituents often have values between -0.8 and 0
3. The methoxy group (OCH3) typically contributes slightly towards increasing the value
4. The ortho substitution pattern (1,2-disubstitution) on benzene can affect the property

Comparing specifically to similar structures:
- O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a value of -0.52204059 (but has two nitro groups)
- Simple methoxybenzene derivatives tend to be slightly less negative than plain aromatics
- The ortho substitution pattern might affect the electronic properties

Taking all these factors into consideration, I predict the property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O to be approximately:

-0.45

This value takes into account the presence of both the nitro and methoxy groups, while considering their electronic effects and the specific substitution pattern.

True Property: 5.8074673443231575
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The target molecule appears to be a complex chlorinated cyclic structure (appears to be a chlorinated derivative of a bicyclic system). Looking at the patterns from the training examples:

1. Highly chlorinated compounds tend to have higher positive values (e.g., ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl has value 1.28197037)
2. Complex cyclic structures generally contribute to higher values
3. Multiple chlorine substitutions typically increase the value
4. The molecule in question has multiple chlorines (8 Cl atoms) and a complex bicyclic structure

Comparing with similar structures in the training set:
- Simple chlorinated compounds have negative values (ClCCCl: -0.75503001)
- More complex chlorinated structures have positive values
- The hexachlorocyclohexane example has value 1.28197037

Given that this molecule has:
- More chlorines than the hexachlorocyclohexane example
- A more complex ring system
- Similar structural complexity to some of the higher-valued compounds

I would predict a value of approximately 2.4 for this molecule.

This prediction takes into account that the value should be higher than the hexachlorocyclohexane (1.28197037) due to additional chlorination and structural complexity, but not as high as some of the very complex structures with multiple ring systems seen in the training set.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.7834295482928028
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCOC=O, propyl formate) by comparing it to the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a relatively small molecule with a formate ester group
2. Contains a short alkyl chain (propyl)
3. Has oxygen atoms in an ester arrangement
4. Similar in size and functionality to some of the simpler molecules in the training set

Looking at similar patterns in the training data:
- Simple molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have negative values
- Short chain esters and similar small molecules generally show values between -0.4 and -0.9
- The presence of the propyl chain would make it slightly less negative than very simple molecules like acetonitrile (CC#N, -0.97930845)
- It's simpler than most of the molecules with positive values

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.65

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It's a small molecule (suggesting more negative values in the training set)
2. Contains oxygen atoms in an ester group
3. Has a short alkyl chain that would moderate the negative value somewhat
4. Shows structural similarity to other simple organic molecules in the training set that have negative values

True Property: 1.32168092909583
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (decyl ethanoate/ethyl decanoate) and predict its property value based on the training examples provided.

Looking at the patterns in the given examples, I notice:
1. Longer carbon chains tend to increase the value
2. Esters (C(=O)O) generally contribute positively but moderately
3. Simple aliphatic compounds without aromatic rings tend to have values between -1 and 2
4. The molecule in question is a straight-chain ester with 12 carbons total

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- Simple alkanes have low negative values (like CC at -0.94)
- Longer chains increase the value (like CCCCCCc1ccccc1 at 0.43)
- Esters and oxygenated compounds tend to be moderate in value

Given these patterns and the relatively long carbon chain combined with the ester group, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.85

This prediction takes into account that it's a moderately long-chain ester without any aromatic rings or other complex functional groups, placing it in a moderate positive range but not as high as compounds with aromatic or complex polycyclic structures.

The target molecule contains:
- A chlorinated aromatic ring
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- A hydroxyl group (OH)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- Multiple substituted benzene rings

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Molecules with chlorinated aromatics typically have values around 1-2
- Presence of nitro groups tends to increase the value
- Amide linkages between aromatic rings, as seen in some examples, contribute positively
- The hydroxyl group might slightly decrease the value
- Multiple substituted aromatics generally lead to higher values

Considering these structural features and comparing to similar molecules in the training set (especially those with chlorinated aromatics and nitro groups), I would predict the property value to be approximately:

2.45

This prediction takes into account the combined effects of the chloro substituents, nitro group, hydroxyl group, and the amide linkage, while considering the overall molecular size and complexity compared to the training examples.

True Property: 59.92373681375968
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the given examples. Let me break down my reasoning:

1) The molecule contains multiple key structural features:
- Two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)(OC)O-)
- Two benzene rings connected by a sulfur bridge
- Multiple ether linkages
- Symmetrical structure

2) Looking at similar compounds from the training examples:
- Compounds with phosphorothioate groups tend to have high positive values (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 has 19.12365378)
- Compounds with multiple aromatic rings connected by heteroatoms typically have moderate to high positive values
- The presence of sulfur bridges generally increases the value
- Symmetrical structures often contribute to higher values

3) This molecule is relatively large and complex, similar to some of the higher-value compounds in the training set.

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the training data, I would predict a property value of approximately:

4.8 to 5.2, with my best specific estimate being 5.1

This prediction takes into account that while the molecule shares some features with the highest-value compounds, it lacks some of the specific structural elements (like multiple chlorine substituents or complex ring systems) that led to the highest values in the training set.

   - NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (salicylamide) has a value of -0.5834204

The target molecule combines both a hydroxyl group and a nitro group on a benzene ring. Based on these structural similarities and the observed values:

1. The presence of the nitro group tends to give slightly negative values
2. The hydroxyl group in similar positions also contributes to negative values
3. The meta substitution pattern typically has less extreme effects than ortho or para

Considering these factors and the range of values seen in similar compounds, I predict the property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O to be approximately:

-0.54

This prediction takes into account the similar electronic effects of the substituents and their positions on the aromatic ring, as well as the general trend seen in related structures from the training set.

5. Similar small molecules in the training set like CCCC(=O)C (-0.7192869) and CC(C)OC=O (-0.80428361) have negative values

Given these observations, and considering that:
- This is a small molecule (4 carbons)
- It contains a triple bond

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.17325777317060576
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the given examples and my understanding of molecular structures.

The molecule CCCCCCCC is n-octane, a straight-chain saturated hydrocarbon (alkane).

Looking at the training examples, I notice:
1. Longer chain hydrocarbons tend to have values close to 0 or slightly negative
2. Simple alcohols (like CCCCCCCO) have values around -0.3 to -0.8
3. The more complex the structure (with rings, aromatics, or multiple functional groups), the higher the value tends to be

3. The formate group (OC=O) typically contributes slightly more negative values than longer chain esters
4. The butyl chain will contribute similarly to other C4 chains in the training set

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCCCOC=O to be approximately:

-0.58

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- More negative than ethyl butyrate (-0.53) due to the formate group
- Similar to but slightly less negative than hexanal (-0.56) due to the ester oxygen
- Within the general range of similar small esters and aldehydes in the dataset

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.8516425742625939
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) by comparing it to the training examples and looking for structural similarities and patterns.

Looking at the training data, I notice:
1. Small halogenated molecules tend to have negative values
2. ClCCCl has a value of -0.75503001
3. The target molecule ClCCl is very similar to ClCCCl, just with one less carbon
4. Other small, simple molecules like CCCC (-0.79402826) and CCBr (-0.75668374) also have similar negative values
5. The presence of halogens in small molecules seems to lead to values around -0.7 to -0.8

Given that ClCCl is:
- A small molecule
- Contains two chlorine atoms
- Is very similar to ClCCCl but slightly smaller
- Has similar polarity characteristics to other halogenated compounds in the dataset

I would predict a property value of approximately -0.78 for ClCCl.

This prediction takes into account that it's slightly smaller than ClCCCl (-0.75503001) and thus might have a slightly more negative value, while still staying within the general range observed for similar small halogenated compounds.

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.5317384923704782
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a dimethylphenol (two methyl groups on a phenol ring).

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (-0.17747252) - a methylated phenol
- Oc1cccc(O)c1 (-0.71841561) - dihydroxybenzene
- Simple phenols generally show negative values
- Adding methyl groups tends to make the value less negative
- The position of substituents matters

Given that:
1. The base phenol structure typically gives negative values
2. Methyl groups tend to increase the value slightly
3. This molecule has two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group
4. The structure is similar to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O but slightly simpler

I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.25

This prediction takes into account that it should be:
- Less negative than simple phenol
- Similar to but slightly more negative than the methylated phenol example
- Accounts for the electronic and steric effects of the two methyl groups

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 1.3536188550458033
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and the target molecule, I notice several patterns:

1. The target molecule contains multiple chlorine substituents and a biphenyl core structure, similar to some examples like "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl" (2.67890972) and "Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl" (1.96892953).

2. The target molecule has 4 chlorines (like some of the examples) and a biphenyl system.

3. The chlorine substitution pattern is somewhat similar but not identical to the reference molecules.

4. Looking at the trends in the data:
- Molecules with multiple chlorines tend to have positive values
- Biphenyl-like structures typically show values between 1.5 and 3.0
- The more chlorines present, generally the higher the value
- The specific positioning of chlorines affects the final value

Based on these observations and comparing with the most similar structures in the training set, I would predict a value of approximately:

2.15

This prediction takes into account that the molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than the 2.67890972 example
- More symmetric distribution than the 1.96892953 example
- Similar core structure to both reference molecules
- A chlorination pattern that would likely place its property value between these reference points
==================================================
Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.8034665192225898
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist analyzing this molecule (CC=C(C)C, which is 2-methylbut-2-ene), I'll make a prediction based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Smaller, simpler molecules tend to have lower values
2. Molecules with double bonds but without aromatic rings tend to have values close to 0
3. The presence of simple alkyl groups (methyl, ethyl) tends to keep values relatively low
4. This molecule is a simple branched alkene with 5 carbons total

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- CCCCCCCCC=C (a linear alkene) has value 0.14570431
- Simple hydrocarbons like CCCCCCCC have values around -0.17
- Small molecules with double bonds like COC(=O)C=C have negative values (-0.86)

Given that this molecule (CC=C(C)C) is:
- Smaller than most examples
- Has a double bond
- Has branching methyl groups
- Is purely hydrocarbon-based
- Is relatively simple in structure

I predict the property value would be approximately: -0.31

This prediction takes into account that it should have a value between the simple alkanes and the more complex alkenes in the training set, while accounting for its small size and branching.
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.8516425742625939

1. It's a very small molecule with just two carbons and two chlorines
2. Looking at similar small halogenated compounds in the training set:
   - ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a value of -0.65806751
   - Simple chlorinated compounds tend to have negative values
3. The molecule is smaller and simpler than most examples
4. It has similar polarity characteristics to tetrachloroethylene but is smaller
5. The presence of chlorines typically contributes to negative values in small molecules

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, particularly looking at similar small halogenated compounds, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.70

This prediction takes into account that:
- Small molecules generally have lower absolute values
- Chlorinated compounds in the training set tend toward negative values
- The molecule is simpler than most reference compounds
- It has similar electronic properties to other small chlorinated compounds in the dataset

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.3143583311500623
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorinated phenol with chlorine atoms in specific positions.

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (very similar, just different chlorine positions) has value -0.3167471
2. Other halogenated aromatics like Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 has value 0.24036227

The target molecule is most similar to the first reference compound, with just a different arrangement of the chlorines. Given that they share:
- Same number of chlorine atoms (3)
- Same core phenol structure
- Similar substitution pattern
- Similar molecular weight and size

The property value should be very close to -0.3167471. The slight difference in chlorine positions might cause a small variation, but the overall physicochemical properties would be very similar.

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value to be approximately:

-0.32

This prediction takes into account the very close structural similarity to the first reference compound while acknowledging that the slightly different substitution pattern might cause a minor variation in the property value.

1. Larger, more complex molecules generally have higher property values
2. Molecules with multiple rings, especially fused rings, tend to have higher values
3. Molecules containing oxygen-rich functional groups (ethers, esters) and multiple substituents tend to have higher values
4. Natural product-like structures with multiple stereocenters typically show higher values

The target molecule appears to be a complex natural product-like structure with:
- Multiple fused rings
- Several oxygen-containing functional groups (methoxy groups, lactone, glycosidic linkage)
- A methylenedioxy group
- Multiple stereocenters
- Complex substitution patterns

Looking at similar complex structures in the training set:
- Steroid-like molecules show values around 9-12
- Complex heterocyclic structures with multiple rings show values around 2-6
- Highly oxygenated molecules with sugar moieties show values around 2-3

Given the complexity, size, and structural features of this molecule (which appears to be even more complex than most training examples), I would predict a property value of approximately:

8.4

This prediction takes into account the molecule's similarity to some of the larger, more complex examples in the training set while considering its unique structural features.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.7694005273733243
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the given molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, I notice:
1. It contains a heterocyclic ring structure with multiple nitrogen atoms
2. Has a thioether (CSc-) group
3. Contains a carbonyl group
4. Has a tert-butyl substituent C(C)(C)C
5. Has an amino substituent (-N)

Comparing to similar structures in the training set:
- It's somewhat similar to CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C (value 1.57292405) which also has nnc and C(C)(C)C groups
- The size and complexity is moderate, similar to molecules with values between 0.5 and 2.0
- Contains sulfur like some other examples with moderate positive values
- The presence of the heterocyclic ring and multiple nitrogen atoms typically contributes to moderate positive values

Based on these structural features and patterns from the training set, I predict the property value would be approximately:

1.45

This prediction takes into account the molecule's moderate size, presence of heteroatoms, and similarity to other structures in the training set with comparable features.

Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.3224851128010315
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ethyl benzoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Simple molecules tend to have negative values
2. Aromatic rings with substituents tend to have values close to 0 or slightly negative
3. The presence of ester groups (C(=O)O) tends to give values slightly negative
4. The size and complexity of the molecule affects the value
5. Similar structures like CCCCC(=O)OCC (ethyl pentanoate) has a value of -0.36130522

The target molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) has:
- A phenyl ring
- An ethyl ester group
- Similar size and functionality to some training examples

Based on these observations and the structural similarities to other molecules in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.28

This prediction takes into account that it's slightly more complex than simple esters but less complex than the highly positive valued molecules, and considers the general trend of similar aromatic esters in the training set.
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.18922654270417172
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (1-bromoheptane, CCCCCCCBr) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a linear alkyl bromide
2. Has 7 carbons in the main chain
3. Similar in size to some of the aliphatic compounds in the training set
4. Contains a single halogen (Br) at the terminal position

Looking at relevant examples from the training set:
- CCCCCCCO (heptanol): -0.33874327
- CCCCCCC=C (1-octene): -0.33863856
- CI (methyl iodide): -0.65354185
- Simple aliphatic compounds generally have values between -0.8 and 0.1

The molecule in question is most similar to CCCCCCCO, but with Br instead of OH. Bromine typically contributes slightly differently than hydroxyl groups, and based on the patterns in the training data, halogenated compounds tend to have slightly higher values than their hydroxylated counterparts.

Considering these factors, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately:

-0.28

This prediction takes into account that:
1. The base structure is similar to heptanol (-0.33874327)
2. Br typically gives a slightly higher value than OH
3. The length of the carbon chain is in a range where the property values tend to be moderately negative

SMILES: CO
True Property: -1.0105844823159527
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I can analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the given training examples. 

CO (methanol) is a very simple molecule with:
- One carbon atom
- One oxygen atom (alcohol group)
- Small molecular size
- Simple linear structure
- Polar nature

Looking at the patterns in the training data:
1. Small, simple molecules tend to have negative values
2. Alcohols generally show negative values (like in CCC(C)CO: -0.6831946)
3. Very simple molecules with few atoms tend to have values between -0.5 and -1.0
4. The presence of oxygen typically doesn't make the value strongly positive

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set, particularly other small molecules and simple alcohols, I would predict the property value for CO (methanol) to be approximately:

-0.85

This prediction takes into account that methanol is:
- Simpler than most training examples
- Contains an alcohol group
- Has very few atoms
- Is similar to but smaller than other alcohols in the training set
- Falls within the general range seen for simple molecules in the training data
