SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.5274609946156709
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a methyl ester with a long alkyl chain (10 carbons).

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (12 carbon chain methyl ester) has value -0.52746099
- CCOC(=O)CC (short chain ester) has value -0.52746099
- Other long chain compounds with similar functional groups tend to have values in this range

The target molecule is very similar to CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, just with two fewer carbons in the chain. Given that both short and long chain esters in the training set have nearly identical values around -0.527, and the structural similarity is very high, I would predict that this molecule would have a very similar property value.

My prediction for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be approximately -0.527, or more specifically:

-0.52746099

The consistency of ester values in the training set makes me fairly confident in this prediction.

True Property: -0.7045441242610493
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

The target molecule appears to be a steroid-like structure with multiple rings, ketone groups, and a hydroxyl group. Looking at similar structures in the training set:

1. The most similar molecule in the training set is "CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C" with a value of -0.07424589
2. The target molecule has similar structural features but with additional oxygen-containing groups

Key observations:
- Both molecules share the basic steroid skeleton
- Both have ketone groups
- The target molecule has an additional hydroxyl group and a slightly modified side chain
- The overall complexity and size are similar

Given these similarities and the slight differences in functional groups, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

The target molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O has several key features:
1. A heterocyclic ring structure with two nitrogen atoms
2. Two carbonyl groups (C=O)
3. A bromine substituent

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.18830001762658388
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the examples provided.

The molecule "c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2" is biphenyl - two benzene rings connected directly to each other.

Looking at the patterns in the training examples:
1. Molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have values between -0.9 and 0.8
2. Simple hydrocarbons with no functional groups tend to have more positive values
3. This molecule is relatively simple and symmetric
4. It's similar in structure to some of the examples like "C1CCc2ccccc2C1" (0.82006902) but without the aliphatic ring
5. It's less complex than the polycyclic aromatic compounds which tend to have more negative values

Based on these observations and the structural similarity to other aromatic compounds in the training set, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.3

This prediction takes into account that the molecule:
- Has a relatively simple structure
- Contains only aromatic rings
- Has no functional groups

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.6481580155867138
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule (CCCCS) and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples:

CCCCS is a relatively simple, linear molecule with:
- 4 carbons in a chain
- A sulfur atom at the end
- No rings, no double bonds, no complex functional groups

Looking at similar patterns in the training set:
- Simple linear alkanes (like CCCCCC(C)C) tend to have values around 0.59
- Small molecules with sulfur (like COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O) tend to have lower values around 0.15
- The presence of sulfur seems to generally reduce the value compared to pure hydrocarbons
- Short chain molecules tend to have values closer to 0 or slightly negative

Taking these factors into account, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.12

This prediction is based on:
1. Starting from the alkane baseline (~0.59)
2. Adjusting downward due to:
   - The presence of sulfur
   - The shorter chain length
   - The terminal position of the sulfur
3. Keeping it slightly positive due to the linear structure

This is my best estimate based on the patterns observed in the training data, though of course there is some uncertainty in this prediction.

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.7815919484358477
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with:
- A primary alcohol group (-OH)
- Two methyl branches
- A butyl chain backbone

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- CCCC(C)(C)C (branched alkane): 0.59352098
- CCCC(C)(O)CC (branched alcohol): 0.78159195
- CC(C)CC(C)O (branched alcohol): 0.78159195
- CCCCOC (linear alcohol ether): 0.78159195

I notice that:
1. Molecules with alcohol groups (-OH) tend to have values around 0.78
2. Branched structures with similar carbon counts have values between 0.59-0.78
3. The presence of an OH group seems to push the value higher compared to pure hydrocarbons

Given that this molecule:
- Has an alcohol group like the examples with ~0.78 values
- Has similar branching pattern to known compounds
- Has similar size/carbon count to the reference molecules

I predict the property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO would be approximately 0.78159195

This prediction is based on the very close structural similarity to several training examples, particularly CCCC(C)(O)CC, which has nearly identical features.

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.30152690270205784
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the given examples.

The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is methylnaphthalene, which is structurally very similar to several molecules in the training set, particularly:

1. Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (value: -0.8496175)
2. Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (value: 0.3015269)

The target molecule is simpler than the first reference compound (which has an additional ring) and very similar to the second reference compound (just missing one methyl group).

Looking at the general patterns in the data:
- Simple aromatic systems tend to have values around 0.8
- Fused ring systems often have lower values
- The presence of methyl substituents on aromatic rings doesn't drastically change the value

Given that our target molecule is a methylnaphthalene, which is structurally between benzene (0.82006902) and the dimethylnaphthalene (0.3015269), but closer in structure to the dimethylnaphthalene, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.35

This prediction takes into account that the molecule should have a value somewhat similar to the dimethylnaphthalene reference compound, but slightly higher due to having one less methyl group.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: -0.5621121452182994
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the given examples.

The target molecule is a barbiturate derivative with an unsaturated side chain, similar in structure to some of the examples provided. Looking at the key features:

1. It contains a barbiturate core (O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1)
2. Has an alkyl substitution with a terminal alkene
3. Contains multiple carbonyl groups
4. Has a cyclic structure with nitrogen atoms

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a value of -0.56211215
- This is the most similar structure, differing only by having an additional alkyl chain

The presence of the longer alkyl chain would likely make the molecule slightly more lipophilic, but the core barbiturate structure would still dominate the property.

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value would be approximately:

-0.52

This prediction takes into account that the longer alkyl chain would slightly moderate the negative value seen in the similar barbiturate example, but would not dramatically change the overall property.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which has:
- A benzene ring (phenyl group)
- A CF3 (trifluoromethyl) substituent

Looking at patterns in the training data:
1. Molecules with single benzene rings tend to have values ranging from -0.7 to 0.8
2. Halogenated compounds (containing F, Cl, Br) generally show negative values
3. Simple aromatic compounds with halogen substitutions tend to be more negative than their non-halogenated counterparts
4. The presence of multiple fluorine atoms typically pushes values more negative

Based on these observations and comparing with similar structures in the training set (like chlorinated benzenes which have values around -0.9 to -1.0), I would predict the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 to be approximately:

-0.85

This prediction takes into account:
- The presence of three fluorine atoms (strong electronegative effect)
- The single benzene ring structure
- The similarity to other halogenated aromatics in the training set
- The relatively simple overall structure

True Property: 0.006153525605036441
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and predict its property based on the given examples and patterns.

The target molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a cyclic sugar (monosaccharide) structure with multiple hydroxyl groups. Looking at similar structures in the training examples:

1. OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO (linear sugar with multiple OH groups) has a value of 0.00615353
2. Most highly oxygenated, polar molecules in the dataset tend to have values close to 0 or slightly positive
3. The cyclic nature and multiple hydroxyl groups make it similar to sugar derivatives

Considering these factors:
- The molecule has similar polarity to the linear sugar example
- It has a cyclic structure which might slightly alter the property
- It contains multiple hydroxyl groups which contribute to its properties
- The overall structural similarity to the linear sugar example is very high

Based on these considerations and the patterns in the training data, I predict the property value to be approximately:

0.02

This prediction is slightly higher than the linear sugar example because of the cyclic structure, but still in the same general range due to similar functional groups and overall polarity.

1. It's a complex steroid-like structure
2. Contains multiple oxygen atoms (ketone, acetate, and hydroxyl groups)
3. Has multiple ring systems
4. Contains several chiral centers
5. Has conjugated ketone system

Looking at similar structures in the training set:
- Complex steroid-like molecules tend to have values around -0.95 to 0.30
- The presence of acetate groups and ketones typically pushes towards more negative values
- Multiple oxygenated functionalities also tend to give more negative values
- The molecule CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C is structurally similar and has a value of -0.95739809

Given these observations and the structural similarity to the steroid example in the training set, but considering the additional oxygenated functionalities, I would predict a value of approximately:

-0.92

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly more polar than the similar steroid example due to additional oxygen atoms, but maintains the same core structure.

- Multiple ring systems (4 fused rings)
- An oxygen (hydroxyl group)
- A ketone group
- Complex cyclic structure
- Similar to some of the other steroidal structures in the training set

2. Looking at similar structures in the examples:
- CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O has a value of -0.81967921
- This is the most similar structure in the training set, also being a steroid with hydroxyl groups

3. Key differences:
- The target molecule has a ketone group instead of an aromatic ring
- The overall carbon framework is very similar
- Both have hydroxyl groups in similar positions

4. Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data:
- Steroidal structures tend to have values in the negative range
- The presence of both ketone and hydroxyl groups likely keeps it in a similar range
- The structural similarity to the reference steroid suggests a close value

Therefore, I predict the property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O to be approximately -0.82

This prediction is based primarily on the structural similarity to the reference steroid compound and the general patterns observed in the training set.

True Property: 0.18830001762658388
Predicted Property:
Looking at the given examples and analyzing the target molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (which is fluorene, a bicyclic aromatic compound), I can make a prediction based on several observations:

1) The molecule contains fused aromatic rings, similar to some examples like c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 (-0.69544692)

2) It's a relatively simple polycyclic aromatic structure, more compact than many of the complex molecules in the training set

3) It doesn't contain any heteroatoms, similar to some simpler aromatic compounds in the examples

4) Its structure complexity is intermediate between simple aromatics and more complex polycyclics

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data, particularly looking at similar aromatic and polycyclic structures, I would predict a property value of approximately:

1. This molecule is structurally very similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) from the examples, which has a value of 0.37896922

2. The only difference is that our target molecule has a methoxy (COC) group instead of an ethoxy (CCOC) group

3. Looking at other patterns in the data:
- Simple aromatic esters tend to have values between 0.3 and 0.6
- The presence of a benzoate group seems to lead to moderate positive values
- Shorter alkyl chains generally give slightly lower values than longer ones in similar structures

4. Given that our molecule is slightly smaller than ethyl benzoate but maintains the same core functional groups, I would expect the value to be slightly lower but in the same range.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 to be approximately:

0.35

This prediction takes into account both the structural similarity to ethyl benzoate and the general trends observed in the dataset regarding molecular size and functional group effects.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.6009288911858048
Predicted Property:
Looking at the examples provided, I notice several patterns that can help predict the property value for C=CCC=C:

1. The molecule C=CCC=C is a small, unsaturated hydrocarbon with two double bonds
2. Looking at similar simple hydrocarbons in the training set:

-0.22

This prediction takes into account that:
1. It should be somewhat close to the value of CC/C=C/C (-0.16694133)
2. The additional double bond would likely make it slightly more negative
3. The conjugated nature of the double bonds would contribute to a more negative value
4. The small size and hydrocarbon nature keeps it from having extreme negative values

True Property: -0.16694133447550707
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to make a prediction.

The molecule CC/C=C\C is a pentene (C5H10) with a trans (E) configuration at the double bond, while one of the training examples CC/C=C/C is the same molecule but with a cis (Z) configuration, which had a value of -0.16694133.

Key observations:
1. The molecules are constitutional isomers (same molecular formula, different arrangement)
2. The only difference is the stereochemistry at the double bond
3. In many chemical properties, cis/trans isomers have similar but slightly different values
4. Trans isomers are generally slightly more stable than cis isomers due to less steric hindrance

- Simple aromatic compounds with alkyl substituents generally show positive values

The target molecule has:
- A benzene ring (like many examples)
- A branched alkyl chain (similar to p-cymene)
- No other functional groups

Based on these observations, and particularly noting that similar alkylbenzenes in the training set have values around 0.82, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.82 ± 0.05

This prediction takes into account that the molecule's structure is very similar to the ethyltoluene and p-cymene examples, which both have values very close to 0.82.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.979333336782049
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (benzaldehyde) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Aromatic rings generally contribute to moderate values
2. Oxygen-containing functional groups, especially carbonyls, tend to push values towards slightly positive numbers
3. Simple aromatic structures with single substituents typically have values between -0.2 and 0.6
4. The presence of an aldehyde group (-CHO) on a benzene ring makes this molecule relatively simple and similar to some of the simpler examples

Given these observations and comparing benzaldehyde's structure to similar molecules in the training set:
- It's simpler than many of the complex polycyclic examples
- It has some structural similarity to COc1ccccc1 (-0.56734819) but with a more polar substituent
- The aldehyde group should increase the value compared to simple benzene derivatives

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) to be approximately:

0.32

This prediction takes into account the molecule's relatively simple structure, the presence of the aromatic ring, and the electron-withdrawing effect of the aldehyde group.

True Property: 0.2149299804247765
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule and compare it to the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally very similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 from the training set, which has a value of 0.21492998. The only difference is that our target molecule has a single N-N bond instead of a N=N double bond.

Looking at patterns in the training data:
1. Molecules with similar diphenyl systems tend to have values in the moderate range
2. The presence of N-N bonds vs N=N bonds typically leads to a slight shift in properties
3. The overall size and conjugation of the system is comparable to several examples

Given these considerations and the very close structural similarity to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (0.21492998), I would predict the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 to be approximately:

0.24 ± 0.03

- Contains three chlorines (which typically leads to higher positive values)
- Is structurally similar to but less complex than Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl

I predict the property value would be approximately 0.65

This value takes into account that it should be:

- An aniline structure (Nc1ccc)
- A sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O)
- Para-substitution pattern
- Relatively polar groups (NH2 and SO2NH2)

Looking at similar patterns in the training examples:

- Polar groups tend to decrease the value somewhat
- Para-substituted benzenes generally show moderate values

Considering these factors and the structural similarity to the nitroaniline example (which has a value of 0.01844956), but accounting for the slightly different electronic effects of the sulfonamide group compared to a nitro group, I would predict a value of approximately:

0.02500000

2. It contains multiple chlorine substituents on a biphenyl core
3. The most similar molecule in the training set is: Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (which has a value of 0.60200991)

The target molecule has:
- Fewer chlorines than the most similar example
- Similar biphenyl core structure
- Similar substitution pattern

Based on these observations and patterns in the training data:
- Chlorinated aromatics tend to have positive values
- The values for similar PCB structures are in the 0.5-0.7 range

Therefore, I predict the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately:

0.58

This prediction takes into account that it should be slightly lower than the fully chlorinated reference compound (0.60200991) but still in a similar range due to its similar structure.

Let me analyze this molecule and make a prediction based on the patterns in the training examples.

The target molecule has these key characteristics:
1. Multiple aromatic rings (3 phenyl groups)
2. Phosphate group (P=O) connecting the aromatic rings
3. Methyl substituents on the aromatic rings
4. Oxygen linkages
5. Relatively complex and symmetric structure

Looking at the training examples:

The molecule "Cc1cccc(C)c1O" is a dimethylphenol (specifically, a dimethyl-substituted phenol with a hydroxyl group).

Looking at similar structures in the training examples:
1. "CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O" (methylated phenol) has a value of -0.56734819
2. "Oc1cccc(O)c1" (dihydroxybenzene) has a value of -0.67449076
3. Simple phenols generally show negative values in the examples

The target molecule has:
- A phenol structure (hydroxyl group on benzene)

- Similar overall structure to some of the training examples

Based on these observations and the patterns in the training data, particularly noting the similarity to "CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O" which has a value of -0.56734819, I would predict the property value for "Cc1cccc(C)c1O" to be approximately:

-0.57000000

This prediction takes into account that the molecule is slightly simpler than some of the reference compounds but maintains similar functional groups and overall structure.

As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (2-methylbut-2-ene) and predict its property value based on the patterns observed in the training examples.

Looking at the patterns in the given examples:
1. Simple hydrocarbons tend to have values between 0.5 and 0.8
2. Small molecules with simple structures generally have higher positive values

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.847634817073241
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ClCCl, dichloromethane) by comparing it with the training examples and considering its structural features:

1. It's a very small molecule with just two carbons
2. It contains two chlorine atoms
3. It's symmetric
4. It's similar in some ways to ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl from the training set which has a value of -0.9753065

Looking at the patterns in the training data:

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.8184658638972385
Predicted Property:
Let me analyze this molecule and compare it with the training examples to predict its property value.

The target molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a tri-chlorinated phenol, which is structurally very similar to one of the training examples: Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (which has a value of 0.81846586).

Key observations:
1. Both molecules have:
   - A phenol structure (hydroxyl group on benzene)
   - Three chlorine substituents
   - Same total number of atoms
   - Similar electronic properties

2. The only difference is in the position of one chlorine atom, but the overall electronic and steric effects would be very similar.

3. Looking at other training examples:
   - Halogenated compounds generally show positive values
   - Multiple halogens tend to push the value higher
   - Phenols with substituents tend to have positive values

Given the extremely close structural similarity to Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (0.81846586), and considering that the slight positional change of one chlorine would not dramatically affect the property, I predict the value would be very close to 0.81846586.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A heterocyclic ring structure with multiple nitrogen atoms
- A thioether (CS-) group
- A carbonyl group (C=O)

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.37896921930352556
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (ethyl benzoate) and predict its property value based on the patterns in the training examples.

Looking at the examples, I notice:
1. Molecules with ester groups (C(=O)O) tend to have negative values
2. Simple aromatic systems with ester substituents typically show values between -0.4 and -0.6
3. The ethoxy group (CCOC) tends to make the value slightly less negative compared to methoxy

Considering these patterns and the specific structure of ethyl benzoate (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1), I would predict a property value of approximately:

-0.52746099

This prediction is based on the similarity to other esters in the training set and the presence of the aromatic ring with an ester substituent, which appears to produce values in this range consistently.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.4083625974543336
Predicted Property:
As an experienced chemist, I'll analyze this molecule (CCCCCCCBr, 1-bromoheptane) by comparing it with the training examples and looking for patterns in molecular structure and corresponding property values.

Key observations:
1. It's a linear alkyl chain (7 carbons) with a bromine terminal
2. Similar to Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (bromonaphthalene) which has 0.67118743
3. Structurally similar to CCCCCCC=C (heptene) which has -0.16694133
4. Contains a halogen terminal like CI (iodomethane) which has 0.15545469
5. Has similar chain length to CCCCCCCO (heptanol) which has 0.78159195

Considering these factors:
- The molecule is less polar than the alcohol (CCCCCCCO)
- It's more similar to the alkene (CCCCCCC=C) in terms of chain length
- Bromine typically contributes to increasing the property value compared to pure hydrocarbons
- The value should be between the similar structures mentioned above

Based on these considerations and patterns in the training data, I predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately:

Looking at similar molecules in the training set:
- Simple alcohols like CCC(C)CO and OCC1OC have values around 0.78
- Very small molecules tend to have values between 0.5 and 0.8
