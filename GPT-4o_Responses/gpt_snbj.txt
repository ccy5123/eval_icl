Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the patterns and trends from the given examples. The molecule in question is a linear aliphatic ester, specifically a decanoate ester.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Linear aliphatic esters like CCCCCCCC(=O)OC have a property value of -0.81223749.
- Linear aliphatic hydrocarbons like CCCCCCC have a property value of -0.71572402.
- The presence of an ester group (C=O)OC tends to decrease the property value compared to the corresponding hydrocarbon.

Given these observations, the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is similar to CCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which has a property value of -0.81223749. Since the molecule in question is slightly longer, it might have a slightly different value, but it is reasonable to predict a similar property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is approximately -0.81223749.

True Property: -0.47610034001227236
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxygen and a nitrogen atom. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings and heteroatoms.

Additionally, the presence of chlorine atoms often contributes to a negative property value, as seen in ClCC (-0.81564338) and ClCCBr (-0.85201745).

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is likely to be negative and in the range of the examples with similar features. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately -0.75.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have negative property values. Additionally, smaller aliphatic molecules with halogens or nitro groups tend to have negative values.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative. Based on the trends in the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.3.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. The molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, similar to some of the examples given.

Considering the structural similarities and the trend observed in the examples, I would predict that the property value for the given molecule, CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, is likely to be negative and in the range of -0.7 to -0.8.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately -0.75.

True Property: -0.04770085892929686
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A difluorobenzene moiety (Fc1cccc(F)c1), which is similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 with a property value of -0.85148622.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N), which is a common feature in several molecules with varying property values.
- A chlorobenzene moiety (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), which is similar to Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 with a property value of 0.46361151.

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like fluorine and chlorine generally tends to lower the property value, as seen in the examples with halogenated aromatics. The amide linkage can have a stabilizing effect, but the overall influence of the halogens is likely more significant.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, the predicted property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 is likely to be negative and closer to the values of other halogenated aromatics. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately -0.75.

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.6263920579940547
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with an alkyl chain. It is similar in structure to other small aliphatic ethers and alcohols in the examples, such as CCCCCO (-0.71572402) and CCCCCC(O)CC (0.25453994). The presence of the ether group (COC) and the overall aliphatic nature suggest that the property value might be influenced by these features.

Given the examples, ethers and alcohols tend to have negative property values, but the presence of branching or additional functional groups can shift the value. In this case, the molecule is relatively simple and similar to CCCCCO, but with a slight branching.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C would be around -0.5. However, given the slight branching, it might be slightly less negative than CCCCCO. Therefore, a predicted property value could be approximately:

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.39759008869859364
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Alkyl Chain (CCC(C)-):** The presence of an alkyl chain often contributes positively to the property value, as seen in examples like CCC(C)CC (0.56947218) and CCCSCC (0.63896814).

2. **Pyrrole Ring (n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O):** Pyrrole rings can have varying effects depending on substitution. The presence of carbonyl groups and a bromine atom can influence the property value. In the example CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (0.28840686), the presence of a bromine atom and a carbonyl group results in a positive property value.

3. **Substituents (Br and Carbonyl Groups):** The bromine atom and carbonyl groups can have a significant impact. In the example OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O (-0.02242199), the presence of carbonyl groups and a halogen results in a slightly negative property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O has a combination of features that suggest a property value that is slightly positive or close to neutral. The alkyl chain contributes positively, while the pyrrole ring with carbonyl groups and bromine may slightly reduce this effect.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O would be around 0.1.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.918030299051648
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 is biphenyl, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. This structure is similar to the example Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1, which has a property value of 0.2577899. The example molecule is a naphthalene derivative, which is also an aromatic system but with a slightly more complex structure due to the additional ring fusion.

Given that biphenyl is a simpler aromatic system compared to the naphthalene derivative, we can expect its property value to be somewhat similar but potentially slightly lower due to the reduced complexity and potential for electronic interactions.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around 0.2.
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.6389681404511427
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the examples provided and look for patterns or similarities. The molecule CCCCCS is a linear alkane chain with a sulfur atom at the end. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Linear alkanes like CCCCCCC=C have negative property values, such as -0.76405691.
- Molecules with sulfur, such as COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O, have positive property values, such as 0.91450175.

However, the presence of sulfur in a simple linear alkane chain might not contribute as significantly to a positive property value as in more complex structures. Given the simplicity of the structure and the presence of sulfur, the property value might be slightly negative or close to zero.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be around -0.1.

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.12436679882714508
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol, specifically 2-methyl-2-pentanol. In the examples, we have several aliphatic and branched hydrocarbons, as well as alcohols, which can help us make a prediction:

1. CCC(C)(C)C (2,2-dimethylbutane) has a property value of 0.80105277.
2. CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O (a cyclic alcohol) has a property value of 0.74459331.
3. CCCC(C)(O)CC (a similar branched alcohol) has a property value of -0.1243668.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is similar to CCCC(C)(O)CC, but with a slightly different branching pattern. The presence of the alcohol group generally tends to lower the property value compared to purely aliphatic hydrocarbons.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is likely to be close to that of CCCC(C)(O)CC, but possibly slightly higher due to the different branching. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO would be around -0.1.

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.8803830393115536
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a naphthalene derivative, specifically 1-methyl-naphthalene.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds, particularly those with fused benzene rings like naphthalene, tend to have property values that are negative. For instance, the molecule Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, which is a similar naphthalene derivative, has a property value of -0.75981146. Another example, c1ccccc1 (benzene), has a property value of -0.71752789.

Given the structural similarity of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 to these examples, particularly to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 will also be negative and close to the value of similar naphthalene derivatives.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately -0.75.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 0.8883300874102671
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C", we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided dataset.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic urea, similar to "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C" which has a property value of -0.78235546. The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the new molecule.

The addition of an alkyl chain generally increases hydrophobicity, which can affect the property value. However, the core structure remains a cyclic urea, which tends to have a negative property value in the examples provided.

Considering these factors, the property value for the new molecule is likely to be slightly less negative than -0.78235546 due to the increased hydrophobicity from the additional alkyl chain. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C" would be around -0.75.

True Property: -0.8514862233361791
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Aromatic rings (benzene rings) tend to have positive property values, as seen in molecules like Cc1cccnc1C (0.9692727) and c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 (0.87785183).

2. The presence of halogens, particularly fluorine, can influence the property value. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a negative value (-0.29600589), but the presence of multiple halogens can lead to a more negative value, as seen in Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (-0.05130921).

3. The trifluoromethyl group is electron-withdrawing, which can affect the electronic properties of the benzene ring.

Considering these factors, the presence of the trifluoromethyl group on the benzene ring is likely to result in a property value that is less positive than a simple benzene ring but not as negative as molecules with multiple halogens or other electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around 0.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a sugar alcohol, specifically a hexitol, which is similar to sorbitol. It contains multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups, which are known to increase hydrophilicity and potentially decrease lipophilicity. In the examples provided, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have negative property values, indicating a tendency towards hydrophilicity or lower lipophilicity.

Given the structural similarity to the example OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, which has a property value of -0.77093386, we can predict that OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O will have a similar property value. Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately:

-0.77093386

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C

This molecule is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Cyclic Structure**: The molecule contains multiple fused rings, similar to some of the examples provided, such as CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of -0.35970715.

2. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains ketone groups (C=O) and an ester group (CC(=O)O). These groups are also present in some of the examples, such as CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O with a property value of 0.8992422, and CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C with a property value of -0.35970715.

3. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (C3(O) and C(O)) can influence the property value. In the examples, molecules with hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have negative property values (-0.77093386).

Considering these structural features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule's complexity and the presence of both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups suggest a property value that is likely to be negative, similar to other complex cyclic structures with multiple functional groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately:

True Property: 0.9668554385734924
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is an acetanilide derivative with a nitro group attached to the aromatic ring. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those containing aromatic rings with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.83622204, and COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which has a property value of 0.93368232.

The presence of the nitro group generally contributes to a more negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature. However, the presence of the acetamide group (CC(=O)N-) can have a stabilizing effect, potentially making the property value less negative compared to a simple nitrobenzene.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O would be around -0.5. This value reflects the influence of both the electron-withdrawing nitro group and the stabilizing acetamide group.

3. **Prediction:**
   - Considering the presence of the phosphorothioate group, ester, and thioether linkages, along with the chloro-substituted aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be negative.
   - The complexity and presence of multiple functional groups suggest a property value closer to the more negative examples.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be approximately -0.65.

True Property: 0.8010527672931977
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)(C)CO is tert-butanol, which is a simple alcohol with a tertiary carbon structure. In the examples, we have several alcohols and hydrocarbons with varying chain lengths and branching, such as:

- CCCCCCC(C)O, with a property value of 0.45711712
- CCC(C)CO, with a property value of 0.36332188
- CCCCCCCC(C)O, with a property value of 0.80320862

The property values for alcohols seem to be positive and increase with the length of the carbon chain and branching. Given that tert-butanol is a small, branched alcohol, its property value is likely to be similar to or slightly higher than that of CCC(C)CO (0.36332188) due to the increased branching.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO would be around 0.4.

The molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is a bicyclic compound with two nitrogen-containing heterocycles, specifically a purine-like structure. This structure is similar to nucleobases, which often have negative property values in the examples provided. For instance, the molecule COc2ncc1nccnc1n2, which is a purine derivative, has a property value of -0.67303323. Another example is Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F, which has a property value of -0.66258864.

Given the structural similarity to these examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 will also be negative and in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is approximately -0.67.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, an ester. Esters in the examples tend to have negative property values, likely due to their polar nature and the presence of electronegative oxygen atoms. For instance, CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC has a property value of -0.41650555, and CCC(C)C(=O)C has a property value of -0.57783863.

Considering the structural similarity of CC(C)OC=O to other esters and the trend of negative property values for such compounds, we can predict that the property value for CC(C)OC=O will also be negative.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a symmetrical urea derivative with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. 

Looking at the examples, aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups (like carbonyls) tend to have positive property values, while those with electron-donating groups or more complex structures tend to have negative values. The molecule in question has two phenyl rings connected through a urea linkage, which is somewhat similar to the structure of NC(=O)c1cccnc1, which has a property value of -0.83622204. However, the presence of two phenyl rings might increase the property value slightly due to increased aromatic character and potential resonance stabilization.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 would likely be slightly negative, but not as negative as NC(=O)c1cccnc1. A reasonable estimate might be around -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13, which is triphenylene, we can analyze the examples provided and look for patterns or similarities.

Triphenylene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, similar to the example c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1, which is a larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a property value of 0.54851634. Given that triphenylene is a smaller and more symmetric structure, it is likely to have a similar but slightly lower property value due to its smaller size and potentially lower electronic delocalization compared to the larger polycyclic structure.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of triphenylene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13) would be around 0.4 to 0.5. Therefore, a specific predicted property value could be approximately 0.45.

The presence of amine groups, as seen in molecules like CNN (-0.81564338) and NNc1ccccc1 (0.85508512), also influences the property value.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the predicted property value for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is likely to be around 0.2. This prediction takes into account the balance between the electron-withdrawing sulfonamide group and the electron-donating amine groups, as well as the aromatic system.

- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, with a property value of 0.23631807

These examples have consistent property values, suggesting that the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the aromatic ring with substituents leads to a similar property value. Although the substituents in the given molecule are different (thiomethyl and methyl instead of halogens), the overall electronic and steric effects might not deviate significantly from the examples provided.

Therefore, based on the structural similarity and the consistent property values of the examples, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is approximately 0.23631807.

True Property: 0.0399464543364872
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is an ester, specifically an octanoate ester, with a relatively long alkyl chain. In the examples, we have several esters and long-chain hydrocarbons:

1. CCCCCC(=O)OC, -0.79640959
2. CCCCC, 0.63896814
3. CCCCCC, 0.51236635

The first example, CCCCCC(=O)OC, is a similar ester with a long alkyl chain, and it has a property value of -0.79640959. The second and third examples are long-chain hydrocarbons, which have positive property values.

Given that esters tend to have negative property values in the examples, and considering the similarity to the first example, the property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is likely to be negative and close to that of CCCCCC(=O)OC.

2. The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, which is ethyl benzoate, has a property value of -0.43252093.

Given that methyl benzoate is structurally similar to ethyl benzoate but with a slightly smaller alkyl group, we can expect its property value to be in a similar range, possibly slightly more positive due to the smaller size of the methyl group compared to the ethyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate) would be around -0.4.

True Property: -0.8274653059047649
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear conjugated diene, specifically 1,3-butadiene. 

Looking at the examples, we can see that molecules with conjugated systems, such as aromatic rings or conjugated double bonds, tend to have negative property values. For instance, C=Cc1ccccc1 (styrene) has a property value of -0.78792875, and c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a property value of -0.85323688. These examples suggest that conjugated systems are associated with negative property values.

Given that 1,3-butadiene is a simple conjugated diene, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative, though likely not as negative as more complex aromatic systems. Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C would be around -0.7. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for C=CCC=C is approximately -0.7.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is a simple compound with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. This structure is similar to the example FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br, which has a property value of 0.19539955. Both molecules have a central carbon atom bonded to multiple halogen atoms, which suggests that they might have similar property values.

Considering the similarity in structure and the influence of multiple halogen atoms, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be close to that of FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br. Therefore, I would predict the property value for BrC(Br)Br to be approximately 0.20.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the cyclic amide linkage suggests a positive contribution to the property value. The chlorinated carbon may also contribute positively, but to a lesser extent.

Based on these observations and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 0.75.

- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C), which is a bulky group that can influence the property value.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of electron-withdrawing groups (like the chlorine and the carbonyl groups) and the heterocyclic structure suggest a negative property value. The combination of these features, along with the tertiary amide, suggests a property value in the range of the more negative examples.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be approximately -0.65.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their associated property values.

The molecule CCCOCC is a linear chain with an ether functional group. Let's consider similar structures from the examples:

1. **CC(C)O**: This is a simple alcohol with a property value of -0.82224909.
2. **CC(C)COC(=O)C**: This is an ester with a property value of 0.00015192.

4. **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**: This is an ester with a property value of -0.43252093.

The molecule CCCOCC is an ether, which is somewhat similar to the ester structures in terms of having an oxygen atom in the chain, but it lacks the carbonyl group present in esters. The presence of the ether group (C-O-C) in a simple linear chain suggests that the property value might be closer to neutral or slightly negative, as seen in the examples with esters.

Considering the examples and the nature of the ether group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be around -0.4 to -0.5. However, given the simplicity of the molecule compared to the esters, it might be slightly less negative.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCOCC could be approximately:

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with aromatic rings (benzene derivatives) tend to have property values that are generally positive, especially when they have alkyl substituents.
- For example, Cc1ccccc1N has a property value of 0.9692727, and CCc1ccc(C)cc1 has a property value of 0.17027227.
- The presence of an isobutyl group (CC(C)C) in CC(C)CO has a property value of 0.36332188, indicating that this group contributes positively to the property value.

Considering these observations, the presence of both the isobutyl group and the benzene ring in CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 suggests that the property value should be positive and likely similar to other alkylbenzene derivatives.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 would be around 0.17027227, similar to CCc1ccc(C)cc1, but potentially slightly higher due to the additional branching in the isobutyl group. A predicted value could be approximately 0.2.

- O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.66895175, indicating that the presence of nitro groups significantly affects the property.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of -0.59338196, showing that multiple chloro groups on a benzene ring result in a negative value.

Considering the structure of benzaldehyde, which is simpler than the examples with additional functional groups, and the trend that simpler aromatic compounds with carbonyl groups tend to have property values closer to zero, we can predict that the property value for O=Cc1ccccc1 will be slightly negative or close to zero.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 is approximately -0.1.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.20521673361739304
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with negative property values.
- An aromatic ring with a heteroatom (oxygen), similar to some examples with negative values.
- A cyclic imide structure (a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups), which is not directly present in the examples but can be related to other cyclic structures with negative values.

Based on these observations and the trends in the examples, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value. Considering the structural complexity and the presence of electron-withdrawing groups, a reasonable prediction would be a moderately negative value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is approximately -0.65.

True Property: -0.7792888260940469
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a diaryl hydrazine, which is structurally similar to the example N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 0.9327068. The main difference between the two is the presence of a double bond in the example molecule, which is absent in the target molecule.

The presence of the double bond in the example molecule might contribute to a slightly higher property value due to increased conjugation or other electronic effects. Without the double bond, the target molecule might have a slightly lower property value, but it is still expected to be relatively high due to the presence of two phenyl rings, which are common in molecules with high property values in the examples.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be slightly lower than 0.9327068, but still relatively high. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.90.

The presence of the cyclohexane ring in the structure is also a factor, as seen in C1CCCCCC1 (-0.28209221).

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be negative and in a similar range to the examples with cyclic amide structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately -0.3.

These examples suggest that the presence of chlorine atoms on aromatic rings contributes to a positive property value.

Given that Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is similar in structure to these examples, with multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. Considering the trend observed in the examples, a predicted property value for this molecule could be around 0.969, similar to the other chlorinated aromatic compounds.

- Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O: -0.68478991
- Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O: -0.55216368

The sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is somewhat similar in electron-withdrawing nature to the nitro group, which suggests that the property value might also be negative. Additionally, the presence of an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups generally leads to negative property values.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be around -0.6. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is:

- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is also polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which can contribute to stability and hydrophobic interactions.
- An ether linkage (CCO1), which can add some polarity.

From the examples, molecules with polar groups like sulfonyl and amide tend to have negative property values, especially when combined with aromatic systems. For instance, molecules with multiple halogens or nitro groups, which are also electron-withdrawing, tend to have negative values.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is likely to be negative. Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction would be around -0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two amide groups and a cyclohexane-like structure due to the cyclization of the peptide bond. This structure is relatively small and compact, with polar amide groups that can engage in hydrogen bonding.

Looking at the examples, molecules with polar functional groups like amides, carbonyls, and cyclic structures tend to have negative property values.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of molecular structures with different functional groups and sizes, and their property values range from negative to positive.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure consisting of a chloroethane group. In the examples, simple aliphatic hydrocarbons like CCCCC have a positive property value (0.63896814), while aromatic compounds with halogens like Clc1ccccc1 have negative values (-0.46277191). However, the presence of a single chlorine atom in a small aliphatic chain might not have as strong an effect as in aromatic systems.

Considering the examples, the presence of chlorine in small aliphatic chains might slightly reduce the property value compared to a simple alkane, but not as drastically as in aromatic systems. Therefore, the property value for ClCC is likely to be slightly positive, but less than that of a simple alkane like CCCCC.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be around 0.5.

- Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a property value of 0.96938718.

Given the presence of the pyridine ring, which is less electron-donating than a benzene ring, and the trichloromethyl group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group, the property value is likely to be positive and relatively high.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl would be around 0.9.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCC(O)CCC, which is a similar alcohol with a longer carbon chain, has a property value of -0.45726625.
- CCC(C)CCO, another alcohol with a similar structure but a shorter carbon chain, has a property value of 0.8573103.

The property values for alcohols in the examples vary, but they tend to be positive or slightly negative. Given that CCCCC(C)O is structurally similar to CCC(C)CCO, which has a positive property value, and considering the trend that longer carbon chains in alcohols might slightly decrease the property value, we can predict that CCCCC(C)O will have a positive property value, but likely lower than 0.8573103.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCC(C)O would be around 0.6.

From the examples, we can observe that halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have property values that are influenced by the presence and position of halogens. For instance, ClCCl (dichloromethane) has a property value of -0.81564338, and ClC(Cl)Cl (chloroform) has a property value of -0.82224909. These values are negative, indicating that the presence of halogens generally contributes to a negative property value.

However, aromatic compounds with halogens can have varying property values depending on the specific structure. For example, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl (1,2-dichlorobenzene) has a property value of 0.88108595, which is positive. This suggests that the aromatic nature and the specific arrangement of halogens can lead to a positive property value.

Considering the structure of 1,4-dibromobenzene and the examples provided, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 will be positive, similar to other halogenated aromatic compounds with a symmetrical structure.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately 0.88108595, similar to the example of 1,2-dichlorobenzene.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl is a dichlorinated biphenyl, which is less chlorinated than the example provided. Given that the property values seem to be influenced by the degree of chlorination and aromaticity, and considering the trend that more chlorinated compounds tend to have less negative or more positive property values, we can predict that the property value for this molecule will be slightly more negative than -0.38248578 due to its lower degree of chlorination.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately -0.45.

- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3) attached to a phenyl ring, which is an electron-withdrawing group.
- A ketone group (C=O) within a piperidine ring, which can influence the electronic distribution.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.9336823161466126
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring, and a nitro group (NO2) also attached to the benzene ring. 

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, tend to have negative property values. The example given has a property value of -0.65605192.
- Molecules with methoxy groups, such as COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC, have positive property values. The example given has a property value of 0.91758103.

The presence of both a methoxy group and a nitro group in the same molecule suggests a balance between the electron-donating effect of the methoxy group and the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group. This balance could result in a property value that is closer to neutral, but likely still negative due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be slightly negative, around -0.3 to -0.5. Given the examples and the structural analysis, a specific predicted property value could be:

-0.412

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 0.652936. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the electron-withdrawing effect, which can influence the property value.

Given the high degree of chlorination and the structural similarity to the example with a positive property value, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for this molecule will also be positive and likely in a similar range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is approximately 0.65.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.939616183311892
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have high positive values.
- Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br, I) often have high positive values, but not always.
- Simple hydrocarbons and alcohols tend to have positive values, but not as high as those with nitro groups.
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings or complex structures often have negative values.

The molecule CCCOC=O is relatively simple and does not contain any nitro groups or halogens. It is an ester, which is somewhat similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSP(=S)(OCC)OCC, which has a negative value of -0.21611331. However, CCCOC=O is simpler and does not have the additional sulfur or phosphorus atoms.

Considering these factors, CCCOC=O is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero, as it is a simple ester without any strongly electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be around -0.1.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a long-chain ester, specifically a decanoate ester, which is similar to other aliphatic esters and long-chain hydrocarbons in the examples.

From the examples, we observe that long-chain hydrocarbons and esters tend to have positive property values. For instance, CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 has a property value of 0.93986196, and CCC1CCCCC1 has a property value of 0.90856417. These examples suggest that long aliphatic chains contribute to positive property values.

Given the structure of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, which is a decanoate ester, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. Considering the trend observed in the examples, a value around 0.9 seems plausible.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 0.9.

The molecule in question contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O), which is often associated with negative property values in the examples.
- Two chlorine atoms, which can contribute to either positive or negative values depending on the context.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is present in several examples with varying effects.
- Aromatic rings, which are common in the examples and can have diverse effects on the property value.

Considering the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (0.3391393), tend to have positive values, but this is not a strict rule.
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl (-0.85398404), often have negative values.
- The presence of aromatic rings and amide linkages can lead to a wide range of values, but the combination with nitro and chlorine groups suggests a tendency towards negative values.

Given these considerations, the predicted property value for Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative. Based on the patterns observed, a reasonable prediction would be around -0.5. However, this is a qualitative assessment, and the exact value could vary.

Additionally, the molecule has aromatic rings with substituents, similar to other examples with aromatic systems.

Considering these structural similarities and the presence of multiple phosphorothioate groups, which seem to contribute positively to the property value in the example, I would predict a property value in a similar range. Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 is approximately 0.75.

- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.92263595.
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of -0.79734677.

The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is structurally similar to Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which is a nitrobenzene derivative with a high property value. The presence of the nitro group (N(=O)=O) and the hydroxyl group (O) on the benzene ring suggests that the property value might be influenced by these functional groups.

Given the similarity to Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which has a high property value, and considering the presence of the hydroxyl group, which might slightly alter the property, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be close to that of Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is approximately 0.92263595.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne with a terminal triple bond, also known as 1-butyne.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with alkynes, such as N#Cc1ccccc1C#N, have negative property values.
- Simple linear hydrocarbons, such as CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO, tend to have positive property values, but this is more due to the length and presence of functional groups like alcohols.

Given that CCC#C is a small, simple alkyne without additional functional groups, it is likely to have a property value that is negative, similar to other small, unsaturated hydrocarbons.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around -0.5.

- Molecules with piperidine rings, such as Cn2c(=O)n(C)c1ncn(CC(O)CO)c1c2=O, have a property value of 0.29119529.

Considering these structural features and their associated property values, the presence of both the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage suggests a negative property value. The piperidine ring might slightly increase the value, but the overall influence of the phosphorothioate and amide groups is likely to dominate.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around -0.75.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like the one you've provided involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples given. The molecule in question is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and hydroxyl groups, which suggests a high degree of polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

From the examples, molecules with significant aromatic character and halogen substitutions tend to have negative property values, while those with polar functional groups like hydroxyls and ethers often have positive values. The presence of multiple ether linkages and hydroxyl groups in your molecule suggests it might have a positive property value, similar to other polar compounds in the examples.

Considering these factors, I would predict a positive property value for the given molecule. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value might be around 0.5. However, this is a qualitative prediction and should be verified with experimental or computational methods for accuracy.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to some of the examples provided. For instance, the molecule Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.92263595, and it is a nitrophenol. The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) and the chloro group (Cl) in Oc1ccccc1Cl suggests that it might have a property value influenced by these groups.

Considering the examples, molecules with a phenol group (OH attached to a benzene ring) tend to have higher property values, especially when combined with electron-withdrawing groups like Cl. The molecule Fc1ccccc1, which is fluorobenzene, has a property value of -0.46277191, indicating that halogen substitution on a benzene ring can lower the property value compared to a phenol.

Taking these observations into account, the predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is likely to be positive but not as high as the nitrophenol example. A reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around 0.5.

- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2) attached to the central carbon.
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have negative property values, especially when they are heavily chlorinated or brominated (e.g., Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br, -0.79734677; Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc2Cl, -0.45368857).
- The presence of a pyrimidine ring (as in Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2, 0.88038304) can contribute to a positive property value, but this is in the context of a different overall structure.

Considering these factors, the molecule has a mix of features that could lead to both positive and negative contributions. However, the presence of multiple aromatic rings with chlorine substituents suggests a tendency towards a negative property value, similar to other chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Based on these observations, I would predict a slightly negative property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl. A reasonable estimate could be around -0.3 to -0.5, given the structural similarities to other examples with negative values.

2. CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O has a property value of 0.67769405. This is a tert-butylphenol, which is similar to p-cresol but with a larger alkyl group.

Considering these examples, p-cresol (Cc1cccc(C)c1O) is likely to have a property value between these two examples, as it is structurally simpler than tert-butylphenol but more complex than dihydroxybenzene.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be around 0.6.

For instance, ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of -0.55274738, and ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of -0.53803089. These examples suggest that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms contributes to a negative property value.

Given that ClCCl is a simple molecule with two chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Considering the examples, a value around -0.5 seems plausible for a molecule with two chlorine atoms and a simple structure.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCCl is approximately -0.5.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.5933819566095485
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (-0.84104393) and OC1C=CC2C1C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl (-0.84571162), tend to have negative property values. The presence of chlorine atoms generally contributes to a more negative property value, likely due to their electron-withdrawing nature.

Given that Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is similar to Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a property value of -0.84104393, we can predict that the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl will also be negative and close to this value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is approximately -0.841.

True Property: -0.8550951013066205
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and hydroxyl groups, as well as aromatic rings. The presence of these functional groups and the overall complexity of the structure suggest that it might have a property value that is influenced by both hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions, as well as potential intramolecular hydrogen bonding.

Given the examples, molecules with complex polycyclic structures and multiple functional groups, such as sugars or steroids, tend to have property values that are either moderately positive or negative, depending on the balance of hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule might be slightly positive, reflecting the potential for significant intramolecular interactions and moderate hydrophilicity.

Therefore, a predicted property value for the molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 could be approximately:

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.28318666895030337
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C).

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with similar functional groups and structural features tend to have similar property values. For instance, molecules with nitro groups or aromatic rings often have positive property values, while those with halogens or carbonyl groups tend to have negative values.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C has a thiosemicarbazide moiety, which is somewhat similar to the structure CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C, which has a property value of -0.81368001. Both molecules contain a similar heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and sulfur atoms, as well as a tert-butyl group.

Considering these similarities, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C will be close to that of CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C. Therefore, the predicted property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is approximately -0.81.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.4325209289481938
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is an ethyl benzoate, which is an ester with a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings, such as benzene derivatives, often have property values that are negative, but the exact value can vary depending on the functional groups attached.
- Esters, such as CCCCC(=O)OCC, have a positive property value (0.19447998), but this is for a longer carbon chain.
- The presence of an aromatic ring, as seen in examples like CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O (-0.47020864), tends to result in a negative property value.

Considering these observations, the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ester with a benzene ring, which suggests a property value that is likely negative but not as negative as those with more polar or electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on the trends in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around -0.5. However, given the specific structure and the examples provided, a more precise prediction would be:

**-0.47020864**

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.5123663462813367
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, aromatic rings, and halogen atoms.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached. In the examples, linear alkyl chains with halogen atoms tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of 0.88038304, and the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl has a property value of 0.50431279. These examples suggest that the presence of a bromine atom in an alkyl chain could contribute to a positive property value.

Considering the structure of CCCCCCCBr, which is a heptyl chain with a bromine atom, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around 0.5. However, given the specific examples and the nature of the molecule, a more precise prediction would be:

SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.8291460635282811
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for carbon monoxide (CO) based on the given examples is challenging due to the lack of direct analogs in the provided dataset. However, we can make an educated guess by considering the nature of CO as a small, simple molecule with a polar covalent bond.

In the dataset, small and relatively simple molecules like CCC (propane) and CCBr (bromoethane) have negative property values, such as -0.81564338. Given that CO is also a small molecule, it might be reasonable to predict a similar negative property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO could be around -0.81564338, similar to other small molecules in the dataset.
