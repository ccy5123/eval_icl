True Property: 186.295
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to correlate with the molecular weight or size of the molecules.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a decyl acetate, which consists of a 10-carbon chain (decanol) esterified with acetic acid. This structure is similar to the linear alkanes and alcohols in the examples, such as CCCCCCCCCCO (158.285) and CCCCCCCCCCCO (242.447).

Given that CCCCCCCCCCO has a property value of 158.285 and CCCCCCCCCCCO has a property value of 242.447, we can estimate the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC by considering its molecular size and structure. The addition of the ester group (OC(=O)CH3) to the 10-carbon chain should increase the property value compared to the alcohol CCCCCCCCCCO.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be slightly higher than that of CCCCCCCCCCO, taking into account the additional ester group. A predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC could be approximately 186.0.

- Two methyl groups (C)(C): 2 carbons and 6 hydrogens = 2(12.01) + 6(1.01) = 30.08
- Oxygen atom (O): 16.00

Adding these together gives: 58.14 + 30.08 + 16.00 = 104.22

The given molecule is a cyclic compound with a core structure similar to that of a diketopiperazine, which is a common cyclic dipeptide. The structure includes a cyclized amide with additional alkyl and alkenyl substituents.

From the examples, we have:
- NC(=O)NC1NC(=O)NC1=O with a property value of 158.117
- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)C with a property value of 198.222

The molecule in question has a similar core to these examples but with additional substituents, which would increase the property value. The presence of the alkenyl group (CC=C) and the additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) suggests a higher property value than the simpler cyclic structures.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, similar to the molecule CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of 335.282.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) attached to the aromatic ring, which is also present in the same example.
- An alkyl chain with a double bond (CC(C)=C) attached to a nitrogen, which is a slight variation from the example.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of the nitro and trifluoromethyl groups, the property value for CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O is likely to be close to that of CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O.

True Property: 278.335
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), two methoxy groups (OC), and a benzene ring with a thiomethyl (SC) and a methyl (C) substituent.

Let's break down the molecule:

1. **Phosphorothioate group (P=S)**: This is similar to the phosphorothioate group in the example molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(cc1Cl)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of 297.656. However, the current molecule lacks the nitro group and chlorine substituent, which contribute significantly to the molecular weight and complexity.

2. **Methoxy groups (OC)**: These are common in both molecules, contributing to the molecular weight and polarity.

3. **Benzene ring with substituents**: The example molecule has a benzene ring with a nitro group and a chlorine substituent, while the current molecule has a thiomethyl and a methyl group. The thiomethyl group is less electronegative and contributes less to the molecular weight compared to a nitro group.

Considering these factors, the current molecule is expected to have a lower property value than the example with the nitro and chlorine substituents. The presence of the thiomethyl group and the absence of heavier substituents like nitro and chlorine suggest a moderate decrease in the property value.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 would be approximately 250.000.

The given molecule has six chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure, which is similar to the example with five chlorine atoms. The additional chlorine atom would increase the molecular weight and potentially the property value. Considering the pattern in the examples, the property value is likely to be slightly higher than 395.327.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be approximately 430.000.

From the examples, we can identify a few trends:
- Simple alkanes and alkenes like C=CCCC=C (82.146) and CC(=C)C(=C)C (82.146) have relatively low property values.
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (180.163), tend to have higher property values due to the presence of the nitro group.

Given that CCCN(=O)=O is a small molecule with a single nitro group, its property value is likely to be lower than those of larger, more complex molecules with multiple functional groups. However, it should be higher than simple hydrocarbons due to the presence of the nitro group.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 103.150.

- CCc1ccccc1 (ethylbenzene) with a property value of 106.168
- Cc1ccc(O)c(C)c1 (a methylphenol) with a property value of 122.167
- Cc1ccc(O)cc1C (a methylphenol) with a property value of 122.167
- CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 (propylbenzene) with a property value of 134.222

Cumene (isopropylbenzene) is structurally similar to ethylbenzene but with an additional methyl group on the side chain, which should increase the property value slightly compared to ethylbenzene. It is also similar to propylbenzene, which has a property value of 134.222.

Considering these comparisons, a reasonable prediction for the property value of cumene (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1) would be slightly higher than ethylbenzene and close to propylbenzene. Therefore, a predicted property value for cumene could be approximately:

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 106.12399999999997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we need to consider the molecular structure and compare it with similar structures from the examples provided. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring (C6H5) with an aldehyde group (CHO) attached.

From the examples, we can identify similar structures:
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1 (benzamide) has a property value of 121.139.
- COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC (dimethyl terephthalate) has a property value of 194.186.
- CCCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 (aniline derivative) has a property value of 179.219.

Benzaldehyde is simpler than these examples, with a single aldehyde group attached to the benzene ring. The closest comparison is benzamide, which has a similar structure but with an amide group instead of an aldehyde. Benzamide has a property value of 121.139.

Considering the structural simplicity of benzaldehyde compared to benzamide, we can predict that the property value for benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) will be slightly lower than that of benzamide. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of benzaldehyde is approximately 106.121.

True Property: 238.159
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring, similar to some of the examples. The presence of the nitro group and the heterocyclic structure suggests that the property value might be influenced by these features.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings, such as Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (182.135) and COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (153.137), have property values in the range of 150-180. The presence of additional heterocyclic structures, like in O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)C(C)C (212.249), can increase the property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be around 200. This accounts for the aromatic nitro group and the additional heterocyclic structure.

Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately 200.

True Property: 184.242
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we need to consider the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diphenylamine, which consists of two phenyl groups (c1ccccc1) connected to a nitrogen atom (N) that is also bonded to another nitrogen atom (N).

From the examples, we can observe that the property values seem to correlate with the molecular weight and complexity of the structure. Diphenylamine is a relatively simple aromatic compound compared to some of the more complex structures listed.

The molecular weight of diphenylamine is approximately 169.23 g/mol. Comparing this to the examples, we see that molecules with similar aromatic structures and molecular weights have property values in the range of 160-180.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be approximately 170.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diketopiperazine, a cyclic dipeptide, which is structurally similar to some of the examples given.

The closest example in the list is CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCCCC2, which has a property value of 236.271. The molecule in question, O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, is a simpler diketopiperazine without the additional phenyl ring present in the example.

Given the structural similarity and the absence of additional aromatic rings or complex substituents, the property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be lower than 236.271. A reasonable prediction, considering the simpler structure, would be around 198.222, which is the value for another cyclic compound in the list.

Therefore, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately 198.222.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, likely reflecting molecular weight or a similar property.

The molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a dichlorobiphenyl, which is similar to the example Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of 291.992. The structure of the target molecule is a biphenyl with three chlorine atoms, similar to the example Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl, which has a property value of 223.102, but with additional chlorine atoms.

Considering the additional chlorine atoms and comparing with similar structures, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is likely to be close to the example with three chlorines, which is 291.992. Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately:

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 134.22199999999998
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the examples provided. The given molecule is an alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene, which has the formula C8H10.

From the examples, we have:
- CCCc1ccccc1 (propylbenzene) with a property value of 120.195
- Cc1ccc(C)cc1 (toluene) with a property value of 106.168

Ethylbenzene is structurally between toluene and propylbenzene, with an additional CH2 group compared to toluene. The property values for these molecules seem to correlate with their molecular weights and possibly other factors like boiling points or refractive indices.

Given that ethylbenzene is between toluene and propylbenzene, we can estimate its property value to be between 106.168 and 120.195. Considering the incremental increase from toluene to propylbenzene, a reasonable prediction for ethylbenzene would be around 114.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 (ethylbenzene) is approximately 114.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a sulfonamide derivative, which is similar to some of the examples given.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O consists of a benzene ring (c1ccc(cc1)) and a sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O). The presence of the benzene ring suggests a base property value similar to other aromatic compounds, while the sulfonamide group will add additional mass and influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, we can see that aromatic compounds with additional functional groups like nitro (N(=O)=O) or halogens (Cl, Br) have property values in the range of 120 to 180. For instance, Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of 137.138, and Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1 has a property value of 181.449.

Given that the sulfonamide group is somewhat similar in mass and complexity to a nitro group, we can estimate that the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O will be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 150.

True Property: 202.256
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, we need to consider the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically triphenylene, which consists of three fused benzene rings forming a planar structure.

Looking at the examples, we can see that the property values seem to be related to molecular weight or some other molecular property that correlates with the size and complexity of the molecule. For instance, simple aromatic compounds like benzene derivatives have lower values, while more complex structures with multiple rings or additional functional groups have higher values.

Triphenylene is more complex than a single benzene ring but less complex than some of the larger polycyclic structures in the examples. Based on this reasoning and the pattern observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of triphenylene (c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34) would be around 228.286.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a complex aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles a polyphenolic structure, similar to flavonoids, which are known for their multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple aromatic rings and additional functional groups like hydroxyls and ketones tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule with the SMILES "OC4=C(C1CCC(CC1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(=O)c3ccccc3C4=O" has a property value of 366.844, and it contains multiple aromatic rings and a ketone group.

Given the structure of the target molecule, which includes two aromatic rings, three hydroxyl groups, and a ketone group, it is reasonable to predict a relatively high property value, though likely lower than the example with chlorinated aromatic rings due to the absence of heavy atoms like chlorine.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 286.156, which is similar to the example with multiple aromatic rings and functional groups but without heavy halogen atoms.

Looking at the examples, we can find a similar structure: COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O, which has a property value of 257.273. This molecule also contains a phosphorothioate group and an amide group, but it has additional carbon chains and a different arrangement.

Given the structural similarities and considering the complexity and size of the molecule, the property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is likely to be somewhat lower than 257.273 due to the absence of additional carbon chains and the presence of a simpler structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be approximately 180.000.

True Property: 96.94400000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we need to consider the molecular structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, simple molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond.

Looking at the examples, we can find molecules with similar halogen substitutions and small carbon frameworks. For instance, the molecule Clc1cccc(Br)c1 has a property value of 191.455, and Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of 238.455. These molecules are larger and more complex than Cl\C=C/Cl, as they contain aromatic rings.

A more relevant comparison might be with smaller molecules like FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br, which has a property value of 197.381. However, this molecule is still more complex due to the presence of multiple halogens and a larger carbon framework.

Given the simplicity of Cl\C=C/Cl, with only two carbon atoms and two chlorine atoms, we can expect its property value to be significantly lower than those of the larger, more complex molecules. The closest comparison might be with smaller aliphatic halogenated compounds, though none are directly listed.

Considering the simplicity and the presence of two chlorine atoms, a reasonable estimate for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around 96.943. This value reflects the smaller size and simpler structure compared to the more complex examples provided.

Pyridine (c1ccncc1) has a molecular formula of C5H5N. Calculating its molecular weight:
- Carbon (C): 12.01 g/mol × 5 = 60.05 g/mol
- Hydrogen (H): 1.01 g/mol × 5 = 5.05 g/mol
- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 g/mol × 1 = 14.01 g/mol

Adding these together gives a total molecular weight of 79.11 g/mol.

Based on the examples provided, the property values are close to the molecular weights of the molecules. Therefore, the predicted property value for pyridine (c1ccncc1) is approximately 79.111.

This molecule contains several key features:
- An ester group (COC(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)
- An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substitutions tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of additional functional groups like esters and amides also contributes to increasing the property value.

Comparing with similar structures:
- The molecule "Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2cc(Cl)c(F)c(Cl)c2F" has a property value of 381.112, which includes aromatic rings, halogens, and amide groups.
- The molecule "O=C1N(COC(=O)C)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3" has a property value of 324.336, which includes aromatic rings and ester groups.

Given the structural complexity and the presence of multiple aromatic rings, an ester, and an amide linkage, the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 is likely to be in the higher range.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 350.000.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can look at similar molecules in the provided examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol with five carbon atoms and one hydroxyl group, also known as pentanol.

In the examples, we have:

- CCCCCCC#C (a heptene) with a property value of 110.200
- CCCCCCCCCCCCO (a long alcohol) with a property value of 186.339

The molecule CCCCCO is shorter than the long alcohol example but longer than the simple alkane and alkene examples. The presence of the hydroxyl group will increase the property value compared to a simple alkane of similar length.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO (pentanol) would be around 88.150.

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 267.306
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The property values given seem to be molecular weights, which are calculated based on the atomic composition of the molecules.

Let's break down the molecular formula for CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1:

- C: 12 atoms
- H: 11 atoms
- N: 1 atom
- O: 4 atoms
- S: 1 atom

Now, calculate the molecular weight using the atomic weights:
- Carbon (C): 12.01 amu
- Hydrogen (H): 1.008 amu
- Nitrogen (N): 14.01 amu
- Oxygen (O): 16.00 amu
- Sulfur (S): 32.07 amu

Calculating the molecular weight:
- C: 12 × 12.01 = 144.12
- H: 11 × 1.008 = 11.088
- N: 1 × 14.01 = 14.01
- O: 4 × 16.00 = 64.00
- S: 1 × 32.07 = 32.07

Total molecular weight = 144.12 + 11.088 + 14.01 + 64.00 + 32.07 = 265.288

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is approximately 265.288.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:
- An ester group (COC(=O))
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to a phenyl ring
- A heterocyclic ring with nitrogen (pyrrole-like structure)
- Multiple carbonyl groups

Let's compare these features with the examples:

1. The presence of an ester group is similar to molecules like COC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 (152.149) and CC(C)COC(=O)C (116.160).
2. The nitro group attached to a phenyl ring is a significant electron-withdrawing group, which can be compared to other electron-withdrawing groups like halogens in Clc1ccc(I)cc1 (238.455).
3. The heterocyclic ring with nitrogen is similar to structures like CNC(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc12 (221.256).
4. The presence of multiple carbonyl groups is a common feature in several examples, contributing to the overall property value.

Considering these structural features and their contributions to the property values in the examples, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be in the range of 250-300. Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, a reasonable estimate would be:

True Property: 154.125
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structure and compare it with the examples provided. This molecule is a bicyclic compound with two amide groups, similar to a diketopiperazine structure.

From the examples, we can see that the property values seem to be related to molecular weight or a similar property. For instance, the molecule O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)C(=O)N1 has a property value of 142.070, and it is a cyclic compound with multiple carbonyl groups.

The given molecule, O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, is a smaller bicyclic compound with two carbonyl groups and a cyclopropane ring. It is likely to have a lower property value than the larger, more complex molecules in the examples.

Considering the structure and comparing it to similar compounds, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around 126. This is slightly lower than the 142.070 value for the more complex cyclic compound with additional carbonyl groups.

SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 64.515
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can look at the examples provided and identify a pattern or trend based on the structure and the given property values. The examples suggest that the property values are likely related to molecular weight or some other molecular property that correlates with the size and composition of the molecule.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure with a chlorine atom and two carbon atoms. Let's consider the molecular weights of the components:
- Chlorine (Cl) has an atomic weight of approximately 35.5.
- Carbon (C) has an atomic weight of approximately 12.0.

The molecular weight of ClCC would be approximately:
\[ 35.5 + 12.0 + 12.0 = 59.5 \]

Looking at the examples, the property values seem to be slightly higher than the molecular weights, possibly due to additional factors such as structural complexity or specific interactions. For instance, the molecule ClC(Cl)(Cl)N(=O)=O has a property value of 164.375, which is higher than its molecular weight due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and a nitro group.

Given the simplicity of ClCC and its relatively low molecular weight, we can predict that its property value will be close to its molecular weight, but slightly higher. Based on the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be around 75.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule consists of a chlorinated pyridine ring with a trichloromethyl group attached. 

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the property value. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 395.327, and it contains multiple chlorine atoms. Similarly, Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O has a property value of 315.716, with several chlorine atoms and a nitro group.

The molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a pyridine ring, which is similar to a benzene ring but with a nitrogen atom, and a trichloromethyl group. The presence of the nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring might slightly lower the property value compared to a fully chlorinated benzene ring, but the trichloromethyl group will contribute significantly to the property value due to the three chlorine atoms.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl would be around 280.000.

SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: 102.17699999999998
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCC(C)O, we can look at similar structures from the examples provided. The molecule CCCCC(C)O is a hexanol, specifically 2-hexanol, which is an alcohol with a six-carbon chain and a hydroxyl group.

From the examples, we have:
- CCCCCCC, which is a seven-carbon alkane, with a property value of 114.232.
- CCCCCC(C)(C)O, which is a seven-carbon alcohol with a tertiary alcohol group, with a property value of 130.231.

Given that CCCCC(C)O is a six-carbon alcohol, it is structurally similar to CCCCCC(C)(C)O but with one less carbon and a secondary alcohol group instead of a tertiary one. The property value for CCCCC(C)O should be slightly lower than that of CCCCCC(C)(C)O due to the shorter carbon chain and the difference in the alcohol group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCC(C)O would be around 116.2.

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 235.906
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property in question appears to be related to the molecular weight of the compounds, as the values are consistent with typical molecular weights.

The molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is 1,4-dibromobenzene. To calculate its molecular weight:

- The molecular weight of bromine (Br) is approximately 79.904 g/mol.
- The molecular weight of carbon (C) is approximately 12.011 g/mol.
- The molecular weight of hydrogen (H) is approximately 1.008 g/mol.

1,4-dibromobenzene has the formula C6H4Br2. Therefore, its molecular weight is calculated as follows:

- 6 carbons: 6 × 12.011 = 72.066 g/mol
- 4 hydrogens: 4 × 1.008 = 4.032 g/mol
- 2 bromines: 2 × 79.904 = 159.808 g/mol

Adding these together gives the molecular weight:

72.066 + 4.032 + 159.808 = 235.906 g/mol

Therefore, the predicted property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately 235.906.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular weight of the compounds, as they increase with the addition of heavier atoms like chlorine.

The given molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with a total of 10 chlorine atoms. We can compare it to similar structures in the examples:

1. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 395.327.
2. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl has a property value of 257.547.

The target molecule has more chlorine atoms than the second example and is similar to the first example but with one additional chlorine atom. Therefore, we can expect the property value to be slightly higher than 395.327.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The property values in the examples seem to be related to molecular weight or a similar property.

The given molecule is a triaryl phosphate ester, which includes:

- Three phenyl rings (C6H5) with additional methyl groups (CH3) on two of them.
- A phosphate group (P(=O)(O)(O)) linking the phenyl rings.

Let's break down the structure:

1. Three phenyl rings: Each phenyl ring (C6H5) contributes approximately 77.11 to the molecular weight.
2. Two methyl groups: Each methyl group (CH3) contributes approximately 15.04 to the molecular weight.

- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3)
- A phenyl ring (c1cccc(c1))
- A piperidine-like ring with two chlorine atoms and a ketone group (N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O)

Let's estimate the molecular weight:

Adding these together gives an estimated molecular weight of:
69.01 (CF3) + 77.11 (phenyl) + 163.57 (piperidine-like) = 309.69

Based on the examples, the property values are close to the molecular weights. Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O is approximately 309.69.

From the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Aromatic rings with substituents like methoxy or nitro groups tend to have property values in the range of 150 to 200.

- NN: 14.01 (N) + 14.01 (N) = 28.02 g/mol
- H2: 2 × 1.01 (H) = 2.02 g/mol

Total for the substituent: 28.01 + 28.02 + 2.02 = 58.05 g/mol

Adding the molecular weight of the pyridine ring and the substituent:
79.10 (pyridine) + 58.05 (substituent) = 137.15 g/mol

These examples suggest that the property value increases with the number of chlorine atoms and the complexity of the structure. Given that ClCCl is a smaller and simpler molecule than ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl, we can expect its property value to be lower than 167.850.

Considering the molecular weight and the simplicity of ClCCl compared to ClCBr, which has a property value of 129.384, we can predict that the property value for ClCCl will be lower than 129.384.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl is approximately 84.932.

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: 122.167
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples. The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a methylphenol, specifically p-cresol, which consists of a benzene ring with a methyl group and a hydroxyl group attached.

From the examples, we have:
- Cc1cccc(O)c1 with a property value of 108.140
- Cc1ccc(C)cc1 with a property value of 106.168

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is similar to Cc1cccc(O)c1, but with an additional methyl group. The presence of the methyl group typically increases the property value slightly due to the added mass and potential changes in other properties.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be slightly higher than 108.140. Therefore, a predicted property value could be approximately 122.140.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 291.992
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular weight of the compounds, as they increase with the addition of heavier atoms like chlorine, bromine, and iodine.

The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a biphenyl structure with four chlorine atoms. Let's compare it to the example Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 360.882. This example has six chlorine atoms, while the target molecule has four.

The molecular weight of chlorine is approximately 35.45. The difference in the number of chlorine atoms between the example and the target molecule is two, which corresponds to a weight difference of about 70.9 (2 x 35.45).

Subtracting this difference from the example's property value gives us an estimate for the target molecule:

360.882 - 70.9 = 289.982

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is approximately 289.982.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 70.13499999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular weight of the compounds, as they increase with the complexity and size of the molecules.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, which has the molecular formula C5H8. To estimate its property value, we can calculate its molecular weight:

- Carbon (C) has an atomic weight of approximately 12.01.
- Hydrogen (H) has an atomic weight of approximately 1.01.

For isoprene (C5H8):
- 5 carbons: 5 × 12.01 = 60.05
- 8 hydrogens: 8 × 1.01 = 8.08

Adding these together gives a molecular weight of approximately 68.13.

Based on the examples provided, the property values are close to the molecular weights of the compounds. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC=C(C)C is approximately 68.13.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 84.93299999999999
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular weight of the compounds. To predict the property for the molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane), we can calculate its molecular weight.

The molecular formula ClCCl corresponds to dichloromethane, which has the following atomic weights:
- Carbon (C): 12.01
- Chlorine (Cl): 35.45

The molecular weight of ClCCl is calculated as follows:
- 1 Carbon: 12.01
- 2 Chlorines: 2 × 35.45 = 70.90

Adding these together gives:
12.01 + 70.90 = 82.91

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCCl is approximately 82.91.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 197.448
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples. This molecule is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we have:

- Oc1cccc(Cl)c1 (a monochlorophenol) with a property value of 128.558.
- Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c2Cl (a tetrachlorobiphenyl) with a property value of 326.437.
- ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl (a trichloromethane) with a property value of 167.850.

The molecule in question, Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, has three chlorine atoms and a hydroxyl group on a benzene ring. Given the pattern observed in the examples, the addition of chlorine atoms tends to increase the property value. The presence of a hydroxyl group, as seen in the monochlorophenol example, contributes to a lower property value compared to fully chlorinated compounds.

Considering these factors, the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is likely to be higher than that of the monochlorophenol (128.558) but lower than that of the tetrachlorobiphenyl (326.437). A reasonable estimate, taking into account the additional chlorine atoms, would be around 200.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is approximately 200.

Predicting the property value for the given molecule involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. The examples seem to be related to molecular weight or a similar property, given the numerical values associated with each structure.

The molecule in question is:

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be quite complex, with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and a sugar-like moiety. Based on the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, it is likely to have a higher property value compared to simpler structures.

Given the examples, complex molecules with multiple rings and functional groups tend to have higher values. For instance, the molecule with a value of 328.843 has multiple aromatic rings and functional groups, similar to the structure in question.

Considering the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be in the higher range, possibly around 400. However, without exact calculations, this is an estimation based on structural complexity and comparison to the provided examples.

Therefore, a predicted property value for the given molecule could be approximately 400.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 214.294
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The property values given seem to be molecular weights, as they are consistent with typical molecular weight values for organic compounds.

Let's break down the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C:

1. **CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C**:
   - **CS**: Carbon (C) and Sulfur (S) contribute to the molecular weight.
   - **1nnc(c(=O)n1N)**: This is a pyrazole ring with a carbonyl group and an amine group. The atoms involved are nitrogen (N), carbon (C), and oxygen (O).
   - **C(C)(C)C**: This is a tert-butyl group, contributing additional carbon and hydrogen atoms.

Now, let's calculate the molecular weight:

- **C (Carbon)**: 12.01 amu
- **H (Hydrogen)**: 1.008 amu
- **N (Nitrogen)**: 14.01 amu
- **O (Oxygen)**: 16.00 amu
- **S (Sulfur)**: 32.07 amu

The molecular formula for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C can be deduced as C9H15N3OS.

Calculating the molecular weight:
- C: 9 × 12.01 = 108.09
- H: 15 × 1.008 = 15.12
- N: 3 × 14.01 = 42.03
- O: 1 × 16.00 = 16.00
- S: 1 × 32.07 = 32.07

Adding these together gives:
108.09 + 15.12 + 42.03 + 16.00 + 32.07 = 213.31

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is approximately **213.31**.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 150.177
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples. This molecule is ethyl benzoate, which consists of a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) attached to an ester group (COC(=O)).

From the examples, we have:
- COC(=O)c1cccnc1 with a property value of 137.138
- O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 with a property value of 182.222

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is similar to these examples, particularly the first one, as it contains an ester group attached to a benzene ring. The presence of the ethyl group (CC) instead of a methyl group (C) in the ester could slightly increase the property value compared to the first example.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be slightly higher than 137.138, but likely lower than 182.222. A reasonable estimate would be around 150.000.

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 179.101
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can look at the examples provided and identify a pattern or trend in the property values based on the molecular structure.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached, specifically a heptyl bromide. In the examples, we have:

- CCCCCCCC (octane) with a property value of 100.205
- Fc1cccc(Br)c1 with a property value of 175.000
- c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1 with a property value of 314.802

The presence of a bromine atom generally increases the property value compared to a similar hydrocarbon without bromine. For instance, the aromatic compound with a single bromine (Fc1cccc(Br)c1) has a property value of 175.000, which is higher than typical hydrocarbons of similar size.

Considering the linear alkyl chain CCCCCCC (heptane) would have a property value slightly lower than octane (100.205), the addition of a bromine atom will increase this value. Based on the examples, the increase due to a single bromine atom in a non-aromatic context seems to be significant but not as high as in aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr (heptyl bromide) would be around 150.000, considering the increase due to the bromine atom.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 32.042
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide), we need to consider the pattern in the given examples. The property values provided seem to be related to molecular weight or a similar property that correlates with the size and composition of the molecule.

Carbon monoxide (CO) has a molecular weight calculated as follows:
- Carbon (C) has an atomic weight of approximately 12.01 g/mol.
- Oxygen (O) has an atomic weight of approximately 16.00 g/mol.

Adding these together gives the molecular weight of CO:
12.01 + 16.00 = 28.01 g/mol

Based on the examples, the property values appear to be close to the molecular weights of the molecules. Therefore, the predicted property value for CO is approximately 28.01.
