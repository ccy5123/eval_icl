True Property: -0.1212857238783649
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a fused heterocyclic structure, specifically a chlorinated benzoxazole. The presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in several examples. The heterocyclic structure with an oxygen and nitrogen atom in the ring can also influence the property value, often leading to a moderate increase compared to simple hydrocarbons.

Based on the examples, chlorinated aromatic compounds with additional heteroatoms tend to have property values around 0.5 to 1.0. For instance, Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 0.80933121, and COc2c1occc1c(OC)c3c(=O)cc(C)oc23 has a property value of 0.7507367.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Alkyl Chain**: The molecule has a propyl group (CCC(C)) attached to the pyrrole ring. Alkyl chains generally contribute to a negative property value, as seen in examples like CCC(C)CC (-0.92321208) and CCC(C)CCO (-0.90424796).

2. **Pyrrole Ring**: The presence of a pyrrole ring can contribute to a slightly positive or neutral property value, depending on the substituents. For instance, Nc1nccs1 (-0.78888612) and c1ccoc1 (-1.09730306) show that heterocycles with nitrogen or oxygen can have negative values, but the specific substituents can alter this.

3. **Carbonyl Groups**: The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) can contribute to a more positive property value, as seen in examples like O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC (0.01938725) and CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (0.306609).

4. **Bromine Substitution**: The presence of a bromine atom can also influence the property value. In the example CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (0.306609), the bromine contributes to a positive value.

Considering these factors, the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O has a combination of features that suggest a slightly positive property value. The alkyl chain and pyrrole ring might contribute negatively, but the carbonyl groups and bromine substitution are likely to offset this with positive contributions.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of aromatic rings, substituents, and overall molecular complexity.

Biphenyl consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples, molecules with multiple aromatic rings and relatively simple structures tend to have property values around or slightly below zero. For instance, the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O has a property value of -0.09587842, and it contains a single aromatic ring with a sulfonamide group. The molecule Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1, which is a more complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a property value of 0.09695549.

Given that biphenyl is a relatively simple structure with two connected phenyl rings and no additional substituents, it is reasonable to predict a property value close to zero. Considering the examples, a slightly positive or negative value is plausible.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) is approximately 0.0.

The examples include various types of organic molecules, and the property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly indicating a physicochemical property like hydrophobicity or solubility.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear alkane chain with a sulfur atom at the end. In the examples, linear alkanes and similar structures tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCCCCCC=C has a property value of -0.5379193, and CCCCCCC(C)C has a property value of -0.65342539. These examples suggest that linear alkanes with or without slight branching or unsaturation tend to have negative values.

Considering the presence of sulfur, which might slightly increase the property value due to its polarizability compared to a purely hydrocarbon chain, we can predict a slightly less negative value than a similar hydrocarbon chain without sulfur.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be around -0.5.

- CC(C)CC(C)O has a property value of -0.76935462.
- CCCC(C)(O)CC has a property value of -0.63446128.

These examples suggest that branching and the presence of an alcohol group contribute to a negative property value. Given the similarity in structure, the property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is likely to be in the same range as these examples.

Therefore, I predict the property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO to be approximately -0.75.

- Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (another naphthalene derivative) has a property value of -0.24956278.

The molecule in question, Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, is structurally similar to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, which is also a naphthalene derivative with a methyl group. Given the similarity in structure, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 would be close to that of Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately -0.24956278.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic urea, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of 0.0. The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the new molecule. This additional alkyl group is likely to increase the hydrophobicity of the molecule, which could slightly increase the property value.

Considering the examples, the addition of alkyl groups generally results in a small increase in the property value. Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is likely to be slightly above 0.0.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 0.1.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.34685485956587925
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group is known to be electron-withdrawing due to the high electronegativity of fluorine atoms. This can influence the electronic properties of the benzene ring.

Looking at the examples, molecules with halogen substituents on aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1 (0.54118898) and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (1.71853177), tend to have positive property values. The presence of multiple halogens, especially chlorine, seems to increase the property value.

Given that trifluoromethyl is a strong electron-withdrawing group, similar to the effect of multiple halogens, we can expect the property value to be positive. However, since the trifluoromethyl group is not as bulky as multiple chlorine atoms, the effect might be less pronounced than in the case of Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around 0.5, similar to Clc1ccc(I)cc1, which has a single iodine substituent on the benzene ring.

Therefore, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is approximately 0.5.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a property value of -6.732e-05. This suggests that the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups tends to result in a property value close to zero, likely due to the balancing of polar and non-polar interactions.

Given that OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is structurally similar to the example with a property value of -6.732e-05, we can predict that its property value will also be very close to zero. Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately:

This molecule is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Cyclic Structure**: The molecule has a polycyclic structure similar to steroids, which often have positive property values in the examples.
2. **Functional Groups**: It contains ketone groups (C=O) and an ester group (CC(=O)O), which can influence the property value. In the examples, molecules with ketones and esters have varied property values, but the presence of multiple ketones in a cyclic structure tends to increase the property value.
3. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (C3(O) and C(O)) can also affect the property value. In the examples, molecules with hydroxyl groups in cyclic structures tend to have positive property values.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, such as:

- CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of 1.56094303.

This structure is somewhat similar to the example COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which has a property value of -0.27928798. Both molecules contain a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring, which can have a significant impact on the property value due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of the nitro group, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is likely to be in a similar range to the example with the nitrobenzene moiety.

- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)SC), which is not directly represented in the examples, but similar functional groups like esters and thioesters are present.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring, which is seen in several examples with varying effects on the property value.
- A heterocyclic structure with a nitrogen and oxygen, similar to some of the examples with moderate to high property values.

Considering these features:
- The presence of a phosphorothioate group might contribute to a moderate increase in the property value due to its potential for polar interactions.
- The chlorinated aromatic ring could either slightly increase or decrease the property value, depending on its position and the overall molecular context.
- The heterocyclic structure with nitrogen and oxygen is often associated with moderate to high property values in the examples.

Based on these considerations and the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be around 0.5. This value reflects a balance between the polar and aromatic features of the molecule.

This structure is similar to other alcohols in the examples, such as CCC(C)O and CCCCCCC(C)O, which have property values of -1.03914131 and -0.36467459, respectively. The presence of the hydroxyl group generally contributes to a more negative property value due to its polar nature.

Given the structure of CC(C)(C)CO, it is more branched than CCC(C)O but less extended than CCCCCCC(C)O. Therefore, we can expect its property value to be between those of the two examples, likely closer to CCC(C)O due to the similar size and branching.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O)), which is often associated with polar and potentially electron-withdrawing characteristics.
- An aromatic ring (c1ccc(N)cc1) with an amine substituent, which can contribute to electron-donating properties.
- A guanidine group (NC(=N)N), which is a strong base and can also contribute to electron-donating properties.

From the examples, molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (N(=O)=O) and halogens (Cl, Br) tend to have positive property values, while those with more electron-donating groups or less polar structures tend to have negative values.

Given the presence of both electron-withdrawing (sulfonamide) and electron-donating (guanidine and amine) groups, the property value is likely to be positive but not extremely high, as the electron-donating effects might moderate the overall electron-withdrawing nature.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 would be around 0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is known to contribute to a positive property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which is also electron-withdrawing and typically increases the property value.
- An alkene group (CC(C)=C), which can have a variable effect but often contributes to a slightly negative property value.
- An amine group (CCN), which can contribute to a negative property value due to its electron-donating nature.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (-0.41418132) and Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O (1.28418425), show a range of property values depending on the overall structure.
- The presence of a trifluoromethyl group, as seen in some examples, tends to increase the property value.
- The combination of electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and trifluoromethyl) suggests a positive property value, but the presence of the amine and alkene groups may moderate this effect.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O is likely to be positive, but not extremely high due to the balancing effects of the different functional groups.

A reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately 0.5.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.9046710991444202
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. It has a relatively simple structure with a small number of carbon atoms and an ester functional group. In the examples, similar small esters and simple carbonyl-containing compounds tend to have negative property values. For instance:

- CC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of -0.63488441.
- CCCC=O has a property value of -1.05852856.
- CC(=O)N has a property value of -1.18392061.

Given these examples, the property value for CC(C)OC=O is likely to be negative and in a similar range. Considering the structural simplicity and the presence of the ester group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be approximately -0.65.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.5771169411186523
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the simpler aromatic compounds in the examples.

1. **Aromatic Compounds**: The molecule has a benzene ring, similar to c1ccccc1O (phenol), which has a property value of -0.84690363. The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) on the benzene ring is a common feature.

2. **Substituents**: The molecule has two methyl groups (CH3) attached to the benzene ring. In the examples, simple alkyl groups tend to have negative property values, such as CC(C)C (-1.19299877) and CCC(C)CCO (-0.76935462).

3. **Comparison with Similar Structures**: The molecule c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC has a property value of 0.11631389, which is slightly positive, but it has additional alkyl chains that could influence the property value.

Considering these points, the presence of the hydroxyl group and the methyl groups suggests that the property value might be slightly negative, similar to phenol but potentially less negative due to the additional methyl groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be around -0.7.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.9247026693028908
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is similar to the structure of the example molecules COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl. These examples have property values of 1.76775 and 2.21973454, respectively. The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) in these examples likely contributes to their higher property values.

In the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, the aromatic ring is substituted with a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C). The thiomethyl group is less electronegative than halogens, which might result in a lower property value compared to the halogenated examples.

Considering these structural differences and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be lower than 1.76775 but still positive due to the presence of the phosphorothioate group. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around 1.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples given.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a highly chlorinated biphenyl, which is similar to the example Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 1.71853177. The structure of the molecule in question is also similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 2.04977874.

Given the high degree of chlorination and the aromatic nature of the molecule, it is likely to have a relatively high property value, similar to the examples with multiple chlorine atoms. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 1.8.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.8951698071057409
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl chain (propyl group) attached to a nitro group (N(=O)=O).

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Simple alkanes like CCC (propane) have a property value of -1.32789211.
- The presence of a nitro group generally increases the property value, as seen in molecules like CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of 1.47234445.

Considering the structure of CCCN(=O)=O, it is similar to a simple alkane with an added nitro group. The nitro group is an electron-withdrawing group, which typically increases the property value compared to the parent alkane.

Given these observations, the property value for CCCN(=O)=O is likely to be higher than that of CCC but lower than more complex nitro-containing structures. A reasonable estimate for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around -0.5 to 0.0.

Therefore, a predicted specific property value for CCCN(=O)=O could be approximately -0.3.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.06903823435797513
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is a bromobenzene ring with a fluorine substituent, which is similar to some of the examples given.

Looking at the examples:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of 0.08920444.
- c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12 has a property value of 0.23936909.
- Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl has a property value of 1.05603784.

The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, F) generally increases the property value compared to hydrocarbons alone. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 has both a fluorine and a bromine, which suggests it might have a property value higher than Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 but lower than the fully chlorinated example.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be around 0.15 to 0.25. Given the examples, a specific prediction could be:

True Property: -0.2685557504778958
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with an additional methyl group and a hydroxyl group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CC1CCCO1, which is a cyclopentanol, and has a property value of -0.92363522. However, the presence of additional methyl groups and the bicyclic nature of the target molecule may increase the property value slightly due to increased steric bulk and potential changes in electronic distribution.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is likely to be slightly higher than that of CC1CCCO1. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.85.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), an ester linkage (OCC), and a cyclic imide structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O). This structure is somewhat similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 2.03561335. The main difference is the presence of a sulfur atom (S) in the example, which is replaced by a nitrogen atom (N) in the target molecule.

Considering the structural similarity and the fact that the sulfur atom in the example might contribute to a slightly higher property value due to its electronegativity and size, we can predict that the property value for the target molecule will be slightly lower than 2.03561335.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be approximately 1.9.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzodiazepine-like structure, featuring a carbonyl group attached to a nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring, with an additional phenyl group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of 0.65510832. Both molecules contain aromatic rings and a carbonyl group attached to a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic structure.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of aromatic rings and a carbonyl group in a heterocyclic context, the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is likely to be in a similar range. However, the specific substitution pattern and the presence of additional methyl groups may slightly alter the property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be approximately 0.6.

True Property: -0.3650977249478377
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate. It has a long alkyl chain (heptane) and an ester functional group. In the examples, similar molecules with long alkyl chains and ester groups tend to have property values around neutral or slightly negative. For instance:

- CCCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of -0.09531104.
- CCOC(=O)N has a property value of -0.89516981.
- CC(C)OC(=O)C has a property value of -0.76977776.

Considering the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would likely be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the ester group and the alkyl chain.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately -0.1.

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.4426467320327675
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is methyl benzoate, an ester with a benzene ring. In the examples, we have several molecules with aromatic rings and ester groups:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1: -0.15389593
2. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1: -0.30775339

Both of these examples have ester groups attached to aromatic rings, similar to methyl benzoate. The first example has an additional hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring, which might slightly increase the property value compared to a simple ester. The second example is ethyl benzoate, which is very similar to methyl benzoate, differing only by one carbon in the alkyl chain.

Given the structural similarity between methyl benzoate and ethyl benzoate, we can expect the property value for methyl benzoate to be close to that of ethyl benzoate. Since methyl benzoate has a slightly smaller alkyl group, it might have a slightly lower property value than ethyl benzoate.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate) would be slightly lower than -0.30775339. A predicted value could be around -0.35.

True Property: -1.0968799290807412
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the overall molecular structure.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, also known as 1,3-butadiene. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons and molecules with similar unsaturation levels tend to have negative property values. For instance, CC/C=C/C has a property value of -1.07749268, and C=Cc1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.75036165.

Given this trend, it is reasonable to predict that C=CCC=C will also have a negative property value, likely in a similar range to these examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C is approximately -1.0.

True Property: 0.6784768784543612
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular structure.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is tribromomethane, also known as bromoform. It is a small, symmetrical molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples, halogenated compounds, particularly those with multiple halogen atoms, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1.3872848, and FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br has a property value of 0.14619296.

Given the high degree of halogenation in BrC(Br)Br and its similarity to other halogenated compounds with positive property values, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value for BrC(Br)Br. However, due to its small size and lack of additional functional groups, the property value might not be as high as those of larger, more complex halogenated compounds.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around 0.5.

- An amide linkage (N-C=O) within a cyclic structure, similar to the example CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O, which has a property value of 0.55318099.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is present in several examples with varying effects on the property value.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the cyclic amide linkage suggests a positive contribution to the property value. The chlorinated carbon may also contribute positively, as seen in some examples.

Based on these observations and comparisons, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 1.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Functional Groups and Structural Features:**
   - The molecule contains an amide group (N(C)C(=O)N), which is present in several examples with varying property values.
   - It has a chloro-substituted aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-0.23679182) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (0.32422678).
   - The molecule also contains a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen atoms, which can influence the property value.
   - The presence of a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C) can increase hydrophobicity, potentially affecting the property value.

2. **Comparison with Examples:**
   - Molecules with chloro-substituted aromatic rings and additional electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro groups) tend to have property values around -0.2 to 0.3.
   - The presence of an amide group and a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen atoms can contribute to a more positive property value, as seen in examples like CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O (0.3853601).

3. **Prediction:**
   - Considering the balance of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, along with the structural complexity, the property value is likely to be slightly positive.
   - The tert-butyl group and the heterocyclic ring may contribute to a more positive value compared to simpler chloro-substituted aromatics.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C is approximately **0.35**.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with three chlorine atoms attached to the rings. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, which has a property value of 0.47808424. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in the examples.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of chlorine atoms, the predicted property value for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is likely to be slightly higher than the example with four chlorines due to the ether linkage, which can also contribute to the property value. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.5.

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -1.0774926773095086
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC/C=C\C, we can look at the examples provided and identify the most similar structure. The molecule CC/C=C\C is a linear alkene with four carbon atoms, also known as 2-butene. 

In the examples, the molecule CC/C=C/C, which is also 2-butene but with a different stereochemistry (trans-2-butene), has a property value of -1.07749268. Since the stereochemistry (cis vs. trans) can affect the property value, but the core structure is the same, we can reasonably predict that the property value for CC/C=C\C (cis-2-butene) will be very close to that of trans-2-butene.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C is approximately -1.07749268.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCCOCC is a linear chain with an ether functional group, similar to some of the simpler aliphatic compounds in the examples.

Looking at the examples, simple aliphatic chains and ethers tend to have negative property values. For instance:
- CC(C)O has a property value of -1.17403465.
- CCC(O)CC has a property value of -0.90424796.
- CC(C)Cl has a property value of -0.99664514.

Given that CCCOCC is a simple ether with no additional complex functional groups or aromatic rings, it is reasonable to predict a property value in the negative range, similar to other simple aliphatic ethers and alcohols.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be approximately -0.9.

This molecule is a tertiary amide with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. It is similar in structure to some of the examples given, particularly those with aromatic rings and amide linkages. For instance, the molecule CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 has a property value of 1.11734425, and it also contains aromatic rings and an amide linkage.

Considering the structural similarities, particularly the presence of aromatic rings and the amide group, the property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be in a similar range to those examples with aromatic and amide features.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 1.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-), which is a common feature in several molecules with moderate property values.
- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1), which is present in some examples with varying property values depending on the context.

From the examples:
- Molecules with bromine substitution on benzene rings, such as Fc1cccc(Br)c1 (-0.06903823) and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.08818507), have property values close to zero.
- The presence of an acetamide group, as seen in CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (0.54948818), tends to increase the property value.

Considering these observations, the combination of the acetamide group and the bromobenzene moiety suggests a property value that is slightly positive, but not as high as those with more complex or multiple functional groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around 0.1 to 0.3. Given the examples and the structural analysis, a specific predicted value could be:

True Property: -0.4611877148774779
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is isobutylbenzene, which consists of an isobutyl group (CC(C)C) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1).

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with alkyl chains attached to benzene rings, such as Cc1ccccc1N (-0.72147311) and CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.59608106), tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of a benzene ring generally contributes to a negative property value, as seen in several examples.
- The addition of an alkyl group to a benzene ring, as in CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.46118771), results in a property value that is less negative compared to a simple benzene derivative.

Considering these observations, the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is similar to CCc1ccc(C)cc1, but with an additional methyl group, which might slightly increase the property value (make it less negative).

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 would be slightly less negative than -0.59608106, perhaps around -0.55. However, given the examples and the trends, a more precise prediction would be:

-0.55000000

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.7313975364390304
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with benzene rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro groups) tend to have positive property values.
- Molecules with benzene rings and electron-donating groups (like methoxy groups) tend to have negative property values.
- Simple hydrocarbons or those with small polar groups tend to have negative property values.

Benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, but not as strongly as nitro groups. It is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero, as it is less polarizing than nitro-substituted benzenes but more polar than simple hydrocarbons.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) would be slightly negative, around -0.1 to -0.2. Therefore, a specific predicted value could be:

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group and an oxazole ring. The presence of a nitro group (N(=O)=O) is often associated with higher property values in the examples, as seen in molecules like Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 (0.98012367) and COc2ccc(Oc1ccc(NC(=O)N(C)C)cc1)cc2 (1.00159774). Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings and heteroatoms like oxygen and nitrogen can also influence the property value.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is likely to be positive and relatively high, similar to other molecules with nitro groups and aromatic systems.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 0.95.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.019839236311533896
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group (N-N linkage).

From the examples, we have:

- Nc1ccccc1 with a property value of -0.85636645.
- N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 with a property value of 0.00045198.

The molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, but instead of a double-bonded nitrogen (N=), it has a single-bonded nitrogen (N-N). The presence of the N-N linkage instead of N= might slightly affect the property value, but it is likely to be in a similar range.

Given the similarity to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can predict that the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 will be close to 0.00045198. However, due to the change from N= to N-N, the value might be slightly lower, as the N-N bond could introduce a different electronic effect compared to the N= bond.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be slightly below 0.00045198, but still close to zero. A predicted value could be approximately -0.05.

True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. 

Looking at the examples, we can find a similar structure: O=C1N(COC(=O)CC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 1.50197348. This molecule also contains a diketopiperazine core, but with additional aromatic rings attached, which likely increases its property value.

The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is simpler, lacking the aromatic rings and additional substituents. Therefore, we can expect its property value to be lower than 1.50197348.

Another similar structure is C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1, which is also a cyclic dipeptide with a property value of 0.02931168. This molecule is more similar in complexity to the target molecule, as it lacks the aromatic rings and has a simpler structure.

Considering these comparisons, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be close to that of the simpler cyclic dipeptide, around 0.02931168. However, due to the slight structural differences, a reasonable estimate would be slightly higher, but still below 1.0.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately 0.1.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, tend to have higher property values (1.65707149).
- Simpler chlorinated aromatic compounds, like Clc1ccccc1Cl, have a lower property value (-0.33826715).

The given molecule, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is more complex than Clc1ccccc1Cl due to the additional chlorine and the biphenyl structure, but less complex than the highly chlorinated example with a value of 1.65707149.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would likely be between these two examples. A reasonable estimate would be around 0.5, reflecting the increased complexity and chlorination compared to Clc1ccccc1Cl, but not as high as the more heavily chlorinated example.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.4611877148774779
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically 1,3-diethylbenzene. 

Looking at the examples, we notice that simple aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions, such as Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) and CCc1ccccn1 (ethylpyridine), have property values of -0.72147311. These examples suggest that simple aromatic compounds with alkyl groups tend to have negative property values around this range.

Given the structure of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, which is similar in complexity and functional group presence to the examples mentioned, it is reasonable to predict a property value close to those examples. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is approximately:

-0.72147311

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is a para-substituted aniline with a sulfonamide group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a nitro group instead of a sulfonamide group. The property value for the nitro-substituted aniline is -0.42364415.

The sulfonamide group is less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group, which might result in a slightly less negative property value. However, both groups are electron-withdrawing and can have similar effects on the overall property.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be slightly less negative than -0.42364415. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.35.

- c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 with a property value of 0.67448595

Both of these examples are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with similar structures to the given molecule. The property values for these examples are in the range of approximately 0.57 to 0.67.

Given the structural similarity, the predicted property value for c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 is likely to be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 0.65.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the more complex aromatic structures in the examples, particularly those with multiple aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups.

From the examples, molecules with multiple aromatic rings and oxygen functionalities, such as OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5 (3.32001878) and Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 (1.30930305), tend to have higher property values.

Given the structural complexity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, which can contribute to a higher property value, I would predict that the property value for Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 is likely to be in the higher range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 1.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)O)
- An amide linkage (NC(C)=O)
- A thioester linkage (SC)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, tend to have positive property values.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1, have slightly negative property values.
- Molecules with thioester linkages are not directly represented, but sulfur-containing groups can contribute to a range of property values depending on the context.

Considering these factors, the presence of the phosphorothioate group is likely to have a significant positive influence on the property value, while the amide linkage might slightly reduce it. The overall structure suggests a balance between these influences.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be slightly positive, around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, symmetrical molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, while smaller, simpler molecules with fewer functional groups tend to have negative property values.

Given that Cl\C=C/Cl is a small molecule with two chlorine atoms and no aromatic rings, it is likely to have a property value that is negative but not as low as those of very simple alkanes or alcohols. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around -0.5.

True Property: -0.9912597970353813
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and their properties. Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle similar to benzene but with a nitrogen atom replacing one of the carbon atoms in the ring. 

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23, have a property value of -0.01893527. Pyridine is a simpler structure compared to this example, but it shares the feature of having a nitrogen atom in an aromatic ring.

Considering the examples and the nature of pyridine, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccncc1 would be close to that of other aromatic nitrogen-containing compounds. Therefore, I would predict the property value for pyridine (c1ccncc1) to be approximately -0.02.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has several key features:
1. An ester linkage (OC(=O)) connected to an aromatic ring, similar to some of the examples.
2. A secondary amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23), which is also present in some examples.
3. A chlorinated aromatic ring, which is a feature in several examples with positive property values.
4. A polycyclic aromatic system, which tends to increase the property value.

Based on the examples:
- Molecules with ester and amide linkages, such as CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2 (0.3947556) and CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1OC(C)C (0.2602854), have positive property values.
- Chlorinated aromatic rings, like Clc1ccc(I)cc1 (0.54118898) and Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (0.47808424), also tend to have positive values.
- The presence of a polycyclic aromatic system, as seen in c1cc2ccc3cccc4ccc(c1)c2c34 (0.19307433), contributes positively.

Considering these factors, the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 is likely to have a positive property value, influenced by the ester, amide, chlorinated aromatic, and polycyclic features.

A reasonable prediction for the property value, considering the examples and structural features, would be around 0.35.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.9042479646811592
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a terminal hydroxyl group, making it a primary alcohol (1-pentanol).

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Linear alkanes and simple alcohols tend to have negative property values. For instance, CC(C)CC(C)(C)O (a branched alcohol) has a property value of -0.63446128, and OC1CCCCCCC1 (a cyclic alcohol) has a property value of -0.51895519.
- The presence of an alcohol group (OH) in a linear or slightly branched chain tends to result in a negative property value, likely due to the polar nature of the hydroxyl group and its effect on the overall molecular interactions.

Given these observations, CCCCCO, being a linear alcohol, is expected to have a negative property value. Considering the trend from the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be around -0.5. However, since it is a simple linear alcohol, it might be slightly more negative than the cyclic alcohol example.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCCCO could be approximately -0.55.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is often associated with polar and electron-withdrawing characteristics.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which can also contribute to polarity and hydrogen bonding.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which is common in many of the examples and can influence the property depending on its substitution pattern.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can contribute to polarity.

From the examples, molecules with polar functional groups like sulfonyl and amide tend to have positive property values, especially when combined with aromatic rings. For instance, the molecule CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C has a property value of 1.56965576, and it contains both a sulfonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to other molecules with sulfonyl and aromatic features. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 1.2.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:

1. **Ester Groups (COC(=O))**: These are present in the molecule and are known to contribute to positive property values in some examples, such as CCCCCC(=O)OC (2.00397443) and COC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC (1.42504956).

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The presence of a nitro group is often associated with positive property values, as seen in CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O (1.47234445) and Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-0.43314544).

3. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: Aromatic rings are common in many of the examples and can contribute to both positive and negative property values, depending on the substituents.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring with Nitrogen (C1=C(C)NC)**: This feature is similar to some structures in the examples, such as CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O (0.47237193).

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the molecule likely has a positive property value due to the combination of ester and nitro groups, along with the aromatic system.

Based on the analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately **0.8**.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two carbonyl groups (C=O) and two nitrogen atoms in a six-membered ring. This structure is somewhat similar to amides and other cyclic compounds in the examples.

Looking at the examples, molecules with amide groups and cyclic structures tend to have property values around the range of -0.5 to 0.5, depending on additional substituents and aromaticity. For instance, the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of 0.15842539, and it contains an amide group and an aromatic ring.

Given that the diketopiperazine structure is less complex and lacks additional aromatic rings or halogen substituents, it is reasonable to predict a property value closer to the lower end of the range for amide-containing compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.3.

SMILES: ClCC
True Property: -1.1315384882987578
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The property values seem to be influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the degree of saturation or aromaticity.

In the examples, small aliphatic hydrocarbons like CCCCC and CCC1CCCCC1 have negative property values, while molecules with halogens, especially multiple halogens, tend to have positive property values. For instance, Clc1ccccc1I has a positive value of 0.54118898, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a positive value of 0.32422678.

ClCC is a small molecule with a single chlorine atom attached to a short carbon chain. Based on the examples, the presence of a single chlorine atom in a small molecule like ClCC is likely to result in a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero, as seen with Clc1ccccc1, which has a value of -0.66951412.

Considering these observations, I would predict the property value for ClCC to be slightly negative, around -0.5.

- Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.72479087.
- Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a property value of 1.65707149.

Given the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and the aromatic nature of the molecule, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. Considering the examples, a value around 1.0 to 1.5 seems plausible.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is approximately 1.2.

1. CCCCC(O)CCC, -0.63446128
2. CCC(C)CCO, -0.76935462
3. CCC(CC)CO, -0.76935462

These examples show that alcohols with similar carbon chain lengths tend to have negative property values. The property values for these alcohols are in the range of approximately -0.63 to -0.77.

Given that CCCCC(C)O is structurally similar to these examples, particularly CCC(C)CCO and CCC(CC)CO, we can predict that its property value will also be negative and likely fall within this range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCC(C)O would be approximately -0.70.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values, especially when multiple halogens are present.
- For instance, Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O has a property value of 1.28418425, and it contains multiple halogens and aromatic rings.
- The molecule ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 has a property value of 1.32582452, and it also contains multiple chlorines and aromatic rings.

Considering these observations, 1,4-dibromobenzene is expected to have a positive property value due to the presence of two bromine atoms on an aromatic ring. However, bromine is less electronegative than chlorine, which might slightly reduce the property value compared to similar chlorinated compounds.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around 0.5 to 1.0. Given the examples and trends, a specific prediction could be:

Considering the pattern that more chlorination tends to increase the property value, and given that the example with more chlorines has a value of 3.04351964, we can estimate that the property value for the given molecule will be somewhat lower due to having fewer chlorine atoms.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately 2.5.

- An aromatic ring, which is common in many of the examples and tends to have a neutral to slightly positive effect on the property value.
- A piperidine-like ring with two chlorine atoms and a ketone group, which can increase the property value due to the presence of electronegative atoms and the potential for increased molecular interactions.

Comparing with similar structures in the examples:
- Molecules with multiple halogens, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, have high property values (e.g., 2.04977874).
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1, have moderate property values (e.g., 0.54118898).

Considering these factors, the presence of the trifluoromethyl group, the aromatic ring, and the halogenated piperidine-like ring, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O is likely to be moderately high.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately **1.5**.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.27928797913697107
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring, with a nitro group (NO2) also attached to the ring.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.13531648, which is relatively close to zero but slightly negative.
- The presence of a methoxy group (OCH3) on an aromatic ring, as seen in the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2, which has a property value of 1.0440939, suggests that methoxy groups can contribute to a positive property value.

Considering these observations, the combination of a methoxy group and a nitro group on a benzene ring in COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is likely to result in a property value that is slightly positive, but not as high as those with multiple electron-withdrawing groups or additional complex structures.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around 0.1.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 1.04488247. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in the examples.

Given the high degree of chlorination and the structural similarity to the example with a high property value, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl will also be relatively high.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 1.2.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. Esters generally have moderate to low property values, often slightly negative or close to zero, depending on the specific structure and substituents.

Looking at the examples, simple aliphatic chains like CCC#C and CCCCC#C have negative property values (-1.23177327 and -0.96198659, respectively). The presence of an ester group (OC=O) might increase the property value slightly compared to a simple alkane or alkyne.

Considering the examples and the nature of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be slightly negative, around -0.5 to -0.7. Therefore, a specific predicted property value could be:

True Property: 0.17447564924874528
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is a linear aliphatic ester, specifically decanoate ester. It has a long hydrophobic alkyl chain (10 carbons) and an ester functional group.

- CCCCCCc1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.19140103.
- CCCCOC has a property value of -1.03914131.

Given the structure of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, it is likely to have a property value in the negative range, similar to other long-chain aliphatic compounds with ester or carbonyl groups.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be approximately -0.6.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to the aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.23679182.
- Molecules with phenol groups, such as Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1, have a property value of -0.36549201.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, have a property value of -0.5870029.

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro and chloro groups generally increases the property value, while the phenol and amide groups tend to decrease it. Balancing these effects, the property value is likely to be slightly negative but closer to zero compared to the examples with only one type of these groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be around -0.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- Two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are similar to the phosphorothioate group in the example molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 1.78563705.
- Aromatic rings with sulfur linkages, similar to the example molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, which has a property value of -0.09587842.

The presence of multiple phosphorothioate groups, which are electron-withdrawing and can increase the property value, suggests that the property value will be relatively high. The aromatic rings and sulfur linkages also contribute to the overall property value, but the phosphorothioate groups are likely the dominant factor.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property value, I would predict that the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 is approximately 1.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

In the examples, we have the following relevant molecules:
- Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, with a property value of -0.52511949. This is a chlorinated aniline, which has a similar aromatic structure with an electron-withdrawing group.
- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, with a property value of -0.43314544. This is nitrotoluene, which has a nitro group attached to a benzene ring, similar to our target molecule.
- Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1, with a property value of 1.79053195. This is a more complex molecule with multiple aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups.

The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is most similar to Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, as both have a nitro group attached to a benzene ring. The presence of the hydroxyl group in Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O can influence the property value, but given the similarity in structure, we can expect the property value to be in a similar range.

Therefore, based on the comparison with similar molecules, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.43314544.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a sugar-like structure with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, which is characteristic of polysaccharides or complex carbohydrates.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, such as sugars, tend to have property values that are negative or close to zero. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, which is a sugar-like structure, has a property value of -0.30820537.

Given the complexity and the number of hydroxyl groups in the molecule OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative or close to zero, similar to other sugar-like structures.

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne. It has a terminal alkyne group (C#C) and a relatively small carbon chain. In the examples, molecules with small carbon chains and unsaturated bonds (like triple bonds) tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule N#Cc1ccccc1C#N, which contains triple bonds, has a property value of -0.51973414. Similarly, CCC(C)C(=O)C, which is a small ketone, has a property value of -0.78874187.

Considering these observations, the property value for CCC#C is likely to be negative and in a similar range to other small unsaturated or ketone-containing molecules. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around -0.6 to -0.8.

Given this analysis, I would predict the property value for CCC#C to be approximately:

- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of 0.72479087 and Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl with a property value of 1.03250579.

Considering these structural similarities, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the chlorinated aromatic ring suggests a relatively high property value. The examples with similar features have property values ranging from approximately 0.7 to 1.8.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl would be around 1.5.

True Property: -0.43310697322470026
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a pyridine derivative with a hydrazide group attached to the carbonyl.

1. **Aromatic Ring**: The molecule contains a pyridine ring, which is similar to the aromatic rings in many of the examples. Aromatic rings generally contribute to a slightly negative or near-zero property value.

2. **Carbonyl Group**: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) is common in several examples, such as COc1ccc(C=O)cc1 (-0.44264673) and CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C (1.56965576). The effect of the carbonyl group can vary depending on its context, but it often contributes to a more positive property value.

3. **Hydrazide Group**: The hydrazide group (C(=O)NN) is a polar functional group, which can influence the property value towards a more positive direction due to its potential for hydrogen bonding and increased polarity.

4. **Comparison with Similar Structures**: The molecule Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2 (-0.2985983) has a similar nitrogen-containing heterocycle and a carbonyl group, resulting in a slightly negative property value. However, the additional nitrogen in the hydrazide group of our molecule might shift the property value slightly more positive.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is likely to be slightly negative to near zero, but slightly more positive than Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2 due to the additional nitrogen in the hydrazide group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around:

True Property: 1.647445182629765
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, have relatively high property values (0.91415316).
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, tend to have negative property values (-0.63484595).
- The presence of aromatic rings or complex cyclic structures often increases the property value, as seen in several examples.

Considering these factors, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the piperidine ring might increase the property value, while the amide linkage might decrease it. However, the overall complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups suggest a moderately positive property value.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around 0.5.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.6534253948908392
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (octane), we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The examples suggest that aliphatic hydrocarbons, particularly linear alkanes, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the property values for similar linear alkanes like CCCCCCCO (heptanol) and CCCCCCC (heptane) are -0.63446128 and -0.63446128, respectively.

Given that octane is a straight-chain alkane similar to heptane but with one additional carbon, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and close to those of similar alkanes. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (octane) would be approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbon-carbon triple bond (C#C). The presence of multiple rings and a hydroxyl group suggests some degree of complexity and potential for a higher property value, similar to other polycyclic compounds with oxygen functionalities in the examples.

For instance, the molecule CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO has a property value of 2.022275, and it also contains multiple rings and oxygen functionalities. Another example, CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, has a property value of 1.0217928, and it shares some structural similarities with the target molecule, such as the presence of multiple rings and an oxygen atom.

Considering these comparisons, the target molecule is likely to have a property value in a similar range. Given the structural complexity and the presence of the hydroxyl group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C would be around 1.0 to 1.5.

Therefore, a specific predicted property value for this molecule could be approximately 1.2.

Predicting the property value for the given molecule, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups.

From the examples, it seems that larger, more complex molecules with multiple rings and heteroatoms tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21 has a high property value of 2.23540975, likely due to its large, complex structure with multiple rings and oxygen atoms.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups in the target molecule, it is reasonable to predict a relatively high property value. However, without a precise model or further context on what the property represents, this prediction is based on qualitative analysis.

Therefore, I would predict the property value for the given molecule to be approximately 2.5, considering its structural complexity and the trends observed in the examples.

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.515656660329988
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their properties. The molecule in question is a chlorophenol, which is a phenol (Oc1ccccc1) with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) on an aromatic ring, as in phenol (Oc1ccccc1), tends to have a negative property value. For example, Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.41418132.
- The presence of a chlorine atom on an aromatic ring can increase the property value. For instance, Clc1ccccc1I has a property value of 0.54118898, and Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl has a property value of 0.3935439.

Considering these trends, the combination of a hydroxyl group and a chlorine atom on a benzene ring should result in a property value that is likely between the negative influence of the hydroxyl group and the positive influence of the chlorine atom.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be slightly negative, but closer to zero than a simple phenol due to the presence of chlorine. A predicted value could be around -0.2.

The molecule contains:
- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C), which is a linear and polarizable group.
- An ester linkage (OC(=O)), which is polar and can contribute to a positive property value.
- An amide group (NC(=O)), which is also polar and can contribute to a positive property value.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1), which is similar to other chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples that tend to have positive property values.

Based on the examples:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (2.04977874) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (1.71853177), have positive property values.
- Molecules with ester and amide groups, such as O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (1.77176016), also have positive property values.

Considering these factors, the presence of polar groups, and the chlorinated aromatic ring, the predicted property value for ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 is likely to be positive. A reasonable estimate, considering the examples, would be around 1.5.

True Property: 1.4331083436033603
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has:
- Two chlorophenyl groups, which are present in several examples with positive property values.
- A hydroxyl group attached to a carbon, which is a feature seen in some molecules with negative property values.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2), which is a heterocyclic aromatic ring. Heterocycles can contribute to both positive and negative property values depending on their context.

From the examples:
- Molecules with multiple chlorophenyl groups, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (1.65707149) and Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc2Cl (1.71853177), tend to have positive property values.
- Molecules with hydroxyl groups, such as Oc1ccc(O)cc1 (-0.69304617), tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of heterocycles like pyrimidine can vary, but in the example Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2 (-0.32748684), it contributes to a negative value.

Considering these factors, the presence of multiple chlorophenyl groups suggests a positive contribution, while the hydroxyl group and pyrimidine ring suggest a negative contribution. Balancing these influences, the property value is likely to be slightly positive, but not as high as those with multiple chlorophenyl groups and no negative features.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl is approximately 0.5.

The presence of the ester functional group (OC=O) and the linear alkyl chain suggests that the property value will be similar to other linear alkyl esters or ketones. Given the examples, linear alkyl chains and simple esters tend to have negative property values, often in the range of -0.6 to -0.8.

Therefore, based on the structural similarity to CCCCCCC=O and other linear alkyl compounds, I would predict the property value for CCCCCOC=O to be approximately -0.7.

To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we can look at the example ClCCCl, which has a property value of -0.80029152. The molecule ClCCl is similar to ClCCCl but with one less carbon atom. Given that the property values seem to be influenced by the size and structure of the molecule, and considering that ClCCl is a smaller and simpler molecule than ClCCCl, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for ClCCl would be slightly more negative than that of ClCCCl.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be approximately -0.85.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- Oc1cccc(O)c1, with a property value of -0.69304617, which is a simple phenol.
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, with a property value of -0.30733025, which is a methylated phenol similar to p-cresol but with an additional methyl group.

The structure of Cc1cccc(C)c1O is closer to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O than to Oc1cccc(O)c1, as it has a methyl group on the benzene ring. Given that the property value for CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O is -0.30733025, and considering that Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a simpler structure with one less methyl group, we can predict that its property value will be slightly more negative than -0.30733025.

True Property: -1.0774926773095088
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple alkene with a branched structure. It is similar to other small hydrocarbons and alkenes in the list, such as CCCCCCCC=C, which has a property value of -0.40302596, and CCCCCCCC, which has a property value of -0.65342539. These examples suggest that small hydrocarbons and alkenes tend to have negative property values.

Considering the size and structure of isoprene, which is smaller and less complex than the longer chain alkenes and alkanes, we can predict that its property value will also be negative, but likely closer to zero than the longer chains due to its smaller size and less complex structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C is approximately -0.5.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.9351848639609482
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane), we can analyze the trends in the provided examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

In the examples, simple aliphatic hydrocarbons and small alcohols tend to have negative property values, while more complex aromatic compounds and those with multiple functional groups, especially halogens, tend to have positive values.

Dichloromethane is a small, simple molecule with two chlorine atoms. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl and Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, have positive property values. However, these are more complex than dichloromethane.

Given the simplicity of ClCCl compared to the more complex chlorinated compounds with positive values, and considering that small, simple molecules often have negative values, I would predict a slightly negative property value for ClCCl.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCCl is approximately -0.2.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.14683727544392286
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

In the examples, we have a similar molecule: Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which is 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, with a property value of 0.14683728. The structure of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is identical to this example, as both represent the same chemical compound.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is 0.14683728.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 3.9080602859864895
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known molecules.

The molecule in question appears to have a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups. These features are similar to some of the molecules in the examples that have relatively high property values, such as those with multiple rings and oxygen functionalities.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen atoms, which can contribute to higher property values due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, I would predict a relatively high property value. Based on the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 1.5.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.30884007471881475
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(=O)n1N) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of sulfur and nitrogen atoms, along with the carbonyl group, suggests potential for moderate polarity and hydrogen bonding, similar to some of the examples provided.

Comparing with the examples:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a property value of 0.71309697. This molecule also contains a similar heterocyclic structure with nitrogen and sulfur, and a tert-butyl group.
- C1SC(=S)NC1(=O) has a property value of -0.47104482, which also contains sulfur and nitrogen but lacks the tert-butyl group.

Considering these comparisons, the presence of the tert-butyl group, and the overall structure, the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is likely to be positive but not as high as 0.71309697 due to the absence of additional polar groups like hydroxyl or ether groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be around 0.5.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.30775338848362166
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ester group (COOC) attached to a benzene ring. Let's compare this structure with similar molecules from the examples:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 has a property value of 2.23730424. This molecule is more complex due to the presence of additional functional groups like sulfonamide and a heterocyclic ring, which likely increases its property value.

2. CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of -0.09612846. This molecule is a diketone with a benzene ring, which is somewhat similar to the ester group in ethyl benzoate.

3. O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 has a property value of -0.11509257. This is a diphenyl ether, which is structurally different but still contains aromatic rings.

4. CCOC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C has a property value of 0.93432898. This molecule is an ester with additional functional groups, which increases its complexity and property value.

Considering these comparisons, the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is less complex than the first and fourth examples but more similar to the second example. Therefore, its property value is likely to be closer to that of CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, which is -0.09612846.

Thus, the predicted property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.09612846.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.029600179043578156
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the trends and characteristics of the given examples. The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom at the end. 

From the examples, we observe that:
- Linear alkyl chains tend to have negative property values, as seen with CCCCCCCCO (-0.63446128) and CCCCCCC=C (-0.67281265).
- The presence of a halogen, such as bromine, can increase the property value slightly, as seen with Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (0.23936909).

Considering these observations, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be slightly higher than that of a similar alkane without the bromine, but still negative due to the linear alkyl chain. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around -0.6.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is a small, non-polar molecule with no additional functional groups or complex structures. In the given examples, smaller and simpler molecules, such as alkanes and small functionalized compounds, tend to have negative property values. For instance, simple hydrocarbons like CCC (propane) and CC#C (propyne) have negative values.

Considering the simplicity and small size of CO, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would also be negative, similar to other small molecules in the examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO would be:

-1.0
