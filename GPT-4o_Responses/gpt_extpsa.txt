SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 0.9037883267852259
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxygen and a nitrogen atom. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings and heteroatoms.

From the examples, we observe that chlorinated aromatic compounds, especially those with multiple chlorine atoms, tend to have negative property values. For instance, compounds like ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl have property values of -0.67449076. However, these examples have multiple chlorine atoms, which might contribute to their more negative values.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 has a single chlorine atom and a heterocyclic structure, which might make it less negative compared to the highly chlorinated examples. Additionally, the presence of the heterocyclic structure with an oxygen and nitrogen might influence the property value towards a less negative or slightly positive value, as seen in some heterocyclic examples.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is likely to be slightly negative, but not as negative as the highly chlorinated examples. A reasonable prediction would be around -0.19820115, which is a common value for less chlorinated aromatic compounds with additional functional groups.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.7426361867889417
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is a nitro compound, specifically 2-nitropropane. 

From the examples, we can observe that nitro-containing compounds tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO has a property value of 4.243668. This suggests that the presence of the nitro group significantly increases the property value.

Given this trend, we can predict that the property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O will also be relatively high. However, since the molecule is simpler and smaller than the example with a value of 4.243668, we can expect a slightly lower value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O would be around 3.5.

Both molecules have a similar polycyclic structure with carbonyl groups. The presence of multiple rings and carbonyl groups suggests that the property value might be positive, as seen in the example.

Considering the structural similarities and the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be close to the example with a similar structure. Therefore, I predict the property value for the molecule CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO to be approximately:

- A chlorinated benzene ring (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -0.67449076.

The presence of the amide linkage suggests a potential increase in the property value, while the halogenated benzene rings (fluorine and chlorine) are associated with lower property values. Balancing these factors, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is not as low as the simple halogenated benzenes but not as high as the amide-containing heterocycles.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be around 0.5.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. The presence of a pyrrole ring, carbonyl groups, and a bromine atom suggests that the molecule might have a property value that is influenced by these functional groups.

Looking at the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents, such as Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl and Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, tend to have property values around -0.67449076. However, the presence of carbonyl groups and the specific substitution pattern in the pyrrole ring could shift the property value.

Considering the examples with carbonyl groups and aromatic systems, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 with a property value of 0.10235926, and the influence of the pyrrole ring, the property value for the given molecule is likely to be slightly positive but not very high.

In the examples, molecules with similar aromatic structures, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tend to have a property value of -0.67449076. This value appears frequently for molecules that are primarily hydrocarbon-based and lack polar functional groups or significant heteroatom content.

Given that biphenyl is a simple aromatic hydrocarbon without additional functional groups, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar to those of other hydrocarbon-based aromatic compounds in the examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 (biphenyl) is -0.67449076.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic urea, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of 3.45223486. The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the given molecule, which could potentially increase the property value due to increased hydrophobic interactions or steric effects.

Considering the structural similarity and the effect of the additional alkyl chain, the property value for the given molecule is likely to be slightly higher than 3.45223486. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be approximately:

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with chloro-substituted aromatic rings, such as "Clc1cccc2ccccc12" and "Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1", tend to have a property value of -0.67449076.

Considering the presence of the phosphorothioate group, which is not directly represented in the examples, and the combination of a chloro-substituted aromatic ring with a heterocyclic structure, the property value is likely influenced by both the electron-withdrawing effects of the chlorine and the complexity of the heterocyclic system.

Given these considerations, the predicted property value for "CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12" is likely to be positive and somewhat higher than the simple chloro-substituted aromatic compounds, but not as high as the most complex heterocyclic examples.

The property value for phenol (c1ccccc1O) is given as -0.19820115. The addition of a methyl group (as in toluene, Cc1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.67449076) typically does not significantly increase the property value compared to the base aromatic structure, but it can slightly alter it due to changes in hydrophobicity and electronic effects.

Considering the examples, the presence of the hydroxyl group (O) in phenol contributes to a higher property value compared to simple hydrocarbons or halogenated aromatics. The methyl group in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 may slightly increase the property value compared to phenol due to increased hydrophobicity, but not drastically.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be slightly higher than that of phenol, but not as high as the more complex or highly functionalized molecules. A predicted value could be around -0.1 to 0.0, considering the slight increase due to the methyl group.

Let's predict a specific value: -0.1.

True Property: 0.04989549488446643
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S) with methoxy groups (OC) and a substituted aromatic ring. The examples with similar phosphorothioate structures, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, all have a property value of 0.04989549.

The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has a similar core structure with a phosphorothioate group and an aromatic ring, but with different substituents (SC and C). The presence of these substituents does not significantly deviate from the pattern observed in the examples with halogen substitutions, which also have a property value of 0.04989549.

Therefore, based on the structural similarity and the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is 0.04989549.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, especially those that are aromatic and heavily chlorinated, tend to have a property value of -0.67449076. The given molecule, Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, fits this pattern as it is an aromatic compound with multiple chlorine substituents. Therefore, the predicted property value for this molecule is -0.67449076.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.7426361867889417
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group attached to the end. 

From the examples, we observe that simple aliphatic chains like CCC (propane) and C1CCCCC1 (cyclohexane) have property values of -0.67449076. However, the presence of a nitro group (N(=O)=O) can significantly alter the property value, as seen in molecules with nitro groups, which tend to have higher property values.

For instance, the molecule CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a property value of 5.58181493, and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O has a property value of 17.98069823. These examples suggest that the presence of nitro groups increases the property value.

Considering the simplicity of CCCN(=O)=O compared to the more complex structures with multiple nitro groups, we can expect its property value to be lower than those with multiple nitro groups but higher than simple aliphatic chains without nitro groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 1.5.

- Molecules with halogen substituents like Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, CCCBr, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl have a property value of -0.67449076.
- The presence of a single halogen substituent, such as in Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, results in a property value of -0.67449076.

Given that Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar in structure to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, with the only difference being the substitution of a chlorine atom with a fluorine atom, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be similar to those molecules with halogen substituents.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is -0.67449076.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. This molecule is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group, similar to some of the examples given.

Looking at the examples, we notice that:

- Bicyclic structures with tertiary alcohols, such as CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, tend to have property values around the range of -0.19820115 to 0.44809815.
- The presence of a tertiary alcohol group, as seen in examples like CCC(C)(C)O and CC(C)(C)CO, tends to result in a property value of -0.19820115.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is likely to be close to -0.19820115. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is:

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC) and a cyclic imide structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O). This structure is somewhat similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 1.55789029. The main difference is the substitution of the thioester group (SC(CCl)) with a direct connection to the cyclic imide.

Given the structural similarity, particularly the presence of the phosphorothioate and cyclic imide, the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is likely to be close to that of the similar example. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 1.5.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzodiazepine-like structure, featuring a carbonyl group attached to a nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring, and a phenyl group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule CN2C(=C(O)c1ccccc1S2(=O)=O)C(=O)Nc3ccccn3, which has a high property value of 7.6340499, due to its complex structure and multiple functional groups.

However, the given molecule is simpler and lacks the additional functional groups and complexity that contribute to the high property value in the example. It is more similar to simpler aromatic structures with carbonyl groups, such as O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -0.28979861.

Considering the structural features and comparing with similar examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around -0.28979861, reflecting its aromatic and carbonyl characteristics without additional complex functional groups.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which is similar in structure to other esters and aliphatic chains in the examples.

Looking at the examples, we see that simple aliphatic chains like CCCCC and CCCCCCCCI have a property value of -0.67449076. Esters like CCCCCC(=O)OC have a property value of 0.0. The presence of the ester functional group tends to increase the property value compared to simple alkanes.

Given that CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is an ester with a longer aliphatic chain, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar to other esters, likely around 0.0. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is 0.0.

- The ester CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of 0.0.

Given that COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is structurally similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of 0.0, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is also 0.0.

In the examples, molecules with simple halogenated aromatic rings, such as Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 and Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1, have a property value of -0.67449076. These molecules are relatively simple and contain multiple halogen atoms.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is a simple, small molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. This structure is even simpler than the halogenated aromatic rings mentioned above. Given the trend that simpler, heavily halogenated molecules tend to have a property value of -0.67449076, it is reasonable to predict that BrC(Br)Br will have a similar property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br is -0.67449076.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), similar to the example "COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1" with a property value of 0.51813545.
- A thioester linkage (SC(CCl)), which is not directly present in the examples but is somewhat similar to the thioamide in the example "COCCCNc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(SC)n1" with a property value of 3.05937983.
- A cyclic imide structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O), similar to the example "CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O" with a property value of 0.11912312.

Considering these structural similarities and the range of property values in the examples, the molecule is likely to have a property value influenced by the presence of the phosphorothioate and cyclic imide groups. The presence of the thioester linkage might increase the property value slightly compared to the cyclic imide example.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of "CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O" would be around 0.5 to 1.0. Given the examples and the structural features, a specific prediction could be:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A dimethylamide group (CN(C)C(=O)), which is similar to the structure in CN(C)C(=O)C with a property value of -0.19578452.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O with a property value of 0.74263619.
- A heterocyclic ring with a nitrogen and oxygen, similar to structures like Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2 with a property value of 6.65416582.
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C), which is a common hydrophobic group.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of the chlorinated aromatic ring and the heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen suggests a positive contribution to the property value. The dimethylamide group and tert-butyl group may have a neutral or slightly negative contribution.

Based on these considerations, the predicted property value for CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to the values of other complex aromatic and heterocyclic structures with positive contributions.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which is structurally similar to some of the examples given. Specifically, it resembles the structure of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a property value of -0.19820115. The presence of an ether linkage and an additional chlorine atom in the biphenyl structure could influence the property value, but based on the examples, the presence of chlorine and aromatic rings tends to result in negative property values.

Given the structural similarities and the influence of chlorine atoms, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be close to -0.19820115. However, the additional chlorine and ether linkage might slightly alter this value. Therefore, a predicted property value could be slightly more negative, but still close to the example value.

From the examples, we see that simple alkyl chains like C (methane) and CCC#C (propyne) have a property value of -0.67449076. However, molecules with alcohol groups like CCC(O)CC have a property value of -0.19820115. The presence of an ether group in CCCOCC suggests it might have a property value closer to those with alcohol groups, as ethers and alcohols can have similar polar characteristics.

Given the examples, CCCOCC is most similar to CCC(O)CC, which has a property value of -0.19820115. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOCC is likely to be -0.19820115.

The molecule in question, CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, contains an amide linkage (C(=O)N), a tertiary amine (N(C)(C)), and two phenyl rings. Comparing this structure to the examples:

1. CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 has a property value of 0.70442805. This molecule also contains an amide linkage and two phenyl rings, similar to the molecule in question.

2. Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl has a property value of 1.96512586. This molecule contains an amide linkage and a phenyl ring, but also has additional heteroatoms and a chlorine substituent.

3. Cc1cccc(C)n1 has a property value of -0.40010115. This molecule contains a phenyl ring and a nitrogen atom, but lacks the amide linkage.

Considering these comparisons, the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is most similar to the first example, CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, due to the presence of an amide linkage and two phenyl rings. Therefore, the predicted property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be close to 0.70442805.

Thus, the predicted property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is approximately 0.70442805.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is an acetanilide derivative with a bromine substituent on the phenyl ring. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Acetanilide Core (CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1):** This part of the molecule is similar to the structure CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -0.19578452. The acetanilide core contributes to a slightly negative property value.

2. **Bromine Substituent (Br):** The presence of a bromine atom on the phenyl ring is similar to the structure Fc1cccc(Br)c1, which has a property value of -0.67449076. Bromine tends to contribute to a more negative property value.

Considering these observations, the combination of the acetanilide core and the bromine substituent suggests a property value that is likely negative and possibly more negative than the acetanilide core alone due to the influence of the bromine.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be approximately -0.67449076, as the presence of bromine tends to dominate the property value towards the negative side.

- CCc1ccc(C)cc1: -0.67449076
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1: -0.67449076

These examples suggest that the presence of a benzene ring with alkyl substituents tends to have a property value around -0.67449076. The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is similar to these examples, particularly CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1, which has a property value of -0.67449076.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.28979861021885145
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have higher property values. For instance, molecules like NC(=O)c1ccccc1O and O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O have higher property values due to the presence of electron-withdrawing groups.

Benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, attached to a benzene ring. This suggests that its property value might be higher than those of simple hydrocarbons or halogenated benzenes, which tend to have lower or negative property values.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 would be around 2.0, as it is likely to be higher than simple aromatic hydrocarbons but not as high as molecules with multiple strong electron-withdrawing groups. Therefore, the predicted property value for benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, similar to the first example (Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2) which has a property value of 1.3081747.
- An aromatic ring with a heteroatom (oxygen), similar to the example Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 with a property value of 0.90378833.
- A cyclic amide structure (lactam), which is a feature not directly seen in the examples but can be related to other amide-containing structures.

Considering these features, the molecule has a combination of electron-withdrawing groups (nitro group) and aromaticity, which tend to increase the property value. The presence of a heterocyclic structure with an amide linkage might moderate this effect.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be around 1.0. This value reflects the influence of the nitro group and aromaticity, balanced by the cyclic amide structure.

To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a diaryl hydrazine, which is structurally similar to the example N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -0.05459722. The main difference between the two is the presence of a double bond in the example molecule, which is absent in the molecule we are predicting for.

Given the structural similarity and the fact that the presence or absence of a double bond in such aromatic systems might not drastically change the property value, we can reasonably predict that the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 will be close to that of N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2.

Therefore, the predicted property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is approximately -0.05459722.

- A pyridine ring fused with a chlorinated aromatic ring.
- A glycerol-like moiety (OCC(O)CO).

From the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups, such as acetophenone derivatives, tend to have property values around 0.0 to 1.3. The presence of an amide group, as seen in some examples, can increase the property value, often above 0.5. The presence of a pyridine ring and a chlorinated aromatic ring might slightly decrease the property value, as seen in some examples with chlorinated aromatics.

Considering these factors, the molecule has structural similarities to those with property values in the range of 0.5 to 1.5. Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 1.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is a bicyclic compound with two amide groups. It resembles a diketopiperazine structure, which is a cyclic dipeptide. The presence of carbonyl groups and nitrogen atoms suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and polar interactions, which can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar functional groups and cyclic structures, such as diketopiperazines or other amide-containing compounds, tend to have property values that are not extremely high or low. For instance, the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of 0.23035109, and it contains an amide group.

Considering the structural features and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around 0.2. This value reflects the moderate influence of the amide groups and the cyclic structure on the property in question.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3) attached to a phenyl ring, which is a common feature in several molecules with moderate to high property values.
- A ketone group (C=O) within a cyclic structure, which is also present in some molecules with higher property values.
- Chlorine atoms, which are present in several molecules with lower property values, but in this case, they are part of a more complex structure.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) and aromatic rings tend to have higher property values, but this molecule lacks a nitro group.
- The presence of a trifluoromethyl group and a ketone in a cyclic structure suggests a moderate to high property value.
- The presence of chlorine atoms in a complex structure can lower the property value, but not significantly in this context.

Based on these considerations, the predicted property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O is likely to be moderate, around 0.5 to 1.0. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction would be:

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, have relatively high property values (5.02712633).
- Molecules with methoxy groups, such as CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2, have moderate property values (0.65906989).

The combination of a methoxy group and a nitro group on a benzene ring suggests a property value that is likely to be higher than those of simple aromatic compounds without these groups, but potentially lower than compounds with multiple nitro groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around 1.0.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of -0.67449076. Both molecules are heavily chlorinated, which typically leads to similar properties due to the electron-withdrawing nature of chlorine atoms and the overall non-polar character of the molecule.

Given the structural similarity and the pattern observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl will also be around -0.67449076. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCOC=O is a simple ester, specifically propyl formate.

From the examples, we observe that simple aliphatic hydrocarbons and small halogenated hydrocarbons tend to have property values around -0.67449076. For example, molecules like CCC#C, C1CCCCCC1, and CCCCCC#C all have this value. 

However, when a functional group like an ester is present, the property value tends to be slightly higher. For instance, CC(O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.19820115, and CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 has a property value of 1.30473643. These examples suggest that the presence of an ester group increases the property value compared to simple hydrocarbons.

Given that CCCOC=O is a small ester, we can expect its property value to be slightly higher than -0.67449076 but not as high as the more complex esters or those with additional functional groups. Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be around -0.19820115, similar to other small molecules with oxygen-containing functional groups.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with long alkyl chains, such as CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 and CCC1CCCCC1, tend to have property values around -0.67449076.
- Esters like CCCOC and CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C have property values of -0.48743469 and 2.66313341, respectively. However, the latter is a more complex structure with additional functional groups.

Given that CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is a relatively simple ester with a long alkyl chain, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be closer to those of simple alkyl chains and esters. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately -0.48743469.

The molecule in question contains two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O) attached to aromatic rings. In the examples, molecules with similar functional groups and aromatic systems tend to have higher property values, especially when they contain multiple electron-withdrawing groups or complex aromatic systems.

For instance, the molecule CC(=O)N(S(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1)c2onc(C)c2C has a property value of 5.56577641, which is relatively high due to the presence of sulfonamide and nitro groups attached to aromatic rings. Similarly, Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O has a property value of 5.01072878, also due to the presence of electron-withdrawing groups on an aromatic system.

Given the presence of two phosphorothioate groups and the aromatic structure in the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, it is reasonable to predict a higher property value compared to simpler aromatic compounds without such groups.

Therefore, I predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 to be approximately 5.0.

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 2.182632885973122
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can see that molecules with nitro groups attached to aromatic rings, such as Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (nitrotoluene), have a property value of 0.74263619. Additionally, molecules with phenol groups, such as Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, have a property value of -0.19820115.

Considering the combination of these functional groups in Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, the property value is likely influenced by both the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group and the electron-donating effect of the hydroxyl group. The presence of both groups suggests a property value that might be slightly higher than that of a simple phenol but lower than that of a nitrotoluene.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be around 0.74263619, similar to the nitrotoluene example, as the nitro group has a significant impact on the property value.

OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O

This molecule is a complex sugar, likely a polysaccharide or a derivative, given the multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic ether structures. In the examples provided, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic structures, such as C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, have relatively high property values. The example C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O has a property value of 5.69512707.

Considering the structural similarity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, which typically increase the property value due to their polar nature and potential for hydrogen bonding, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be in a similar range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and structural features.

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne with a terminal triple bond, also known as 1-butyne. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons and molecules with similar structural simplicity tend to have property values around -0.67449076, which is a common value for aromatic hydrocarbons and simple alkanes/alkenes/alkynes.

True Property: -0.2504201961823305
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule "CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl", we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S) similar to the example "COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1" which has a property value of 0.51813545.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring, similar to "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" and "Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl", both of which have a property value of -0.67449076.

The presence of multiple chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring tends to lower the property value, as seen in the examples with chlorinated rings. However, the presence of the phosphorothioate group, which is associated with a positive property value, could increase the overall property value.

Balancing these factors, the predicted property value for "CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl" is likely to be slightly positive, but not as high as the example with the phosphorothioate group and fewer chlorines.

A reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately 0.2.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is a pyridine derivative with a carbonyl group attached to a hydrazine moiety. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2, which has a high property value of 7.83259275. Both molecules contain nitrogen heterocycles and carbonyl groups, which might contribute to a higher property value.

Considering the presence of the carbonyl and hydrazine groups, which can introduce significant electronic effects, and the similarity to the high-value example, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 will also be relatively high.

Therefore, I predict the property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 to be approximately 7.0.

- Molecules with amide linkages, such as "CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C", have moderate property values (-0.09362476).
- Molecules with piperidine rings, such as "CCN2c1cc(N(C)C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23", have moderate to high property values (1.05280156).

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of the phosphorothioate group is likely to increase the property value, while the amide linkage and piperidine ring contribute to a moderate increase.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of "CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C" would be around 1.5.

2. CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 0.44809815. This molecule is also a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group and a ketone group.

The molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C has a similar complexity and functional group arrangement to these examples, particularly the second one, which suggests that its property value might be closer to 0.44809815. However, the presence of the alkyne group could slightly alter the property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C would be around 0.5.

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings. Based on the examples provided, molecules with complex polycyclic structures and multiple functional groups, such as esters and ethers, tend to have positive property values. 

For instance, the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 has a property value of 1.52349525, and it contains multiple ether linkages and aromatic rings. Similarly, the molecule CCCCC(C)C1(CC)C(=O)NC(=S)NC1=O has a property value of 1.74087645, and it also contains multiple functional groups and a cyclic structure.

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.19820115285127862
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to the structure of phenol (Oc1ccccc1) with an additional chlorine atom. In the examples, phenol derivatives with nitro groups (Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O and Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O) have higher property values (2.18263289), while halogenated benzenes like Clc1ccccc1I and Fc1ccccc1 have lower property values (-0.67449076).

Given that Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorinated phenol, it is reasonable to expect its property value to be influenced by both the hydroxyl group and the chlorine atom. The presence of the hydroxyl group might increase the property value compared to simple halogenated benzenes, but not as much as the nitro group does.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be slightly higher than the halogenated benzenes but lower than the nitro-substituted phenols. Therefore, a predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl could be around 0.11606106, similar to COc1c(O)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, which also contains both hydroxyl and chlorine substituents.

- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C), which is a small, linear, and polarizable group.
- An ester linkage (OC(=O)), which is polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.
- An amide group (NC(=O)), which is also polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1), which is similar to some of the chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, tend to have a property value of -0.67449076.
- Molecules with ester and amide functionalities, such as COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC and O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3, have positive property values.

Considering the combination of these functional groups, the presence of polar and hydrogen-bonding groups, and the chlorinated aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be positive but not extremely high.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around 0.9.

To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2) attached to the central carbon.
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents often have negative property values, such as Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (-0.67449076) and Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.67449076).
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen, such as Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2 (3.04008934) and Cn1cnc2n(C)c(=O)[nH]c(=O)c12 (3.14201958), tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of a phenol group, as in Oc1ccc(O)cc1 (0.60198581), also contributes to a positive property value.

Considering these observations, the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl has a combination of features that suggest a positive property value, primarily due to the pyrimidine ring and the phenol group, despite the presence of chlorine-substituted phenyl rings which typically contribute negatively.

Based on these structural considerations and the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 1.5.

For the molecule "ClCCl", which is dichloromethane, we can compare it to similar structures in the examples. The molecule "ClCCCl" (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of -0.67449076. Given that dichloromethane is a smaller molecule with similar chlorine content, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would be similar or slightly different due to its smaller size.

The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl fits this pattern, as it is a dichlorinated biphenyl structure with symmetry and multiple chlorine atoms.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is -0.67449076.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the examples provided and look for patterns or similarities. The molecule CC=C(C)C is a simple alkene, specifically 2-methyl-1-butene.

From the examples, we can observe that simple hydrocarbons, particularly alkanes and alkenes, tend to have negative property values. For instance:

- CCCCCCCC (octane) has a property value of -0.67449076.
- CCCCCCCC=C (1-octene) also has a property value of -0.67449076.
- Cc1ccccc1C (toluene) has a property value of -0.67449076.

These examples suggest that simple hydrocarbons, whether saturated or unsaturated, tend to have similar negative property values. Given that CC=C(C)C is a small, simple hydrocarbon similar to those mentioned, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be in the same range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC=C(C)C is -0.67449076.

Predicting the property value for the given molecule involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule in question, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, including methoxy groups, hydroxyl groups, and cyclic ethers.

From the examples, molecules with high property values often contain multiple functional groups, especially those with oxygen and nitrogen, and complex ring systems. For instance, the molecule OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O has a very high property value of 89.05399284, likely due to its multiple hydroxyl groups and complex cyclic structure.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups in the target molecule, it is reasonable to predict a relatively high property value. However, it is unlikely to be as high as the example with the highest value, as the target molecule does not have as many hydroxyl groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 10.0.

From the examples, molecules with heterocyclic rings and carbonyl groups, such as CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C (2.79467923) and Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2 (3.04008934), tend to have positive property values. The presence of a tert-butyl group, which is a bulky alkyl group, might also contribute to a positive property value, as seen in some examples.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be around 2.8 to 3.0. Therefore, a specific predicted property value could be:

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with ester groups and aromatic rings tend to have property values around 0.0 to 1.0. For instance, the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 has a property value of 17.1882552, but it contains additional functional groups that significantly increase its value. The molecule CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, which is a diketone with an aromatic ring, has a property value of 0.30618981.

Considering the structure of ethyl benzoate and the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be around 0.3. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached. In the examples, linear alkyl chains such as CCCCCCCCO have a property value of -0.19820115, and aromatic compounds with halogens like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 have a property value of -0.67449076. However, the presence of a bromine atom in a non-aromatic, linear alkyl chain context is not directly represented in the examples.

Considering the examples, the presence of a halogen in a non-aromatic context, such as CI, has a property value of -0.67449076. However, the linear alkyl chain context might reduce the impact of the halogen compared to aromatic systems.

Given these considerations, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be closer to the linear alkyl chain values, but slightly influenced by the presence of the bromine atom. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around -0.67449076, similar to other halogenated compounds in the examples.

Given this pattern, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CO would also be around -0.67449076. Therefore, the predicted property value for CO is:
