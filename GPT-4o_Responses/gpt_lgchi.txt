SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.4379343166126474
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the trends and patterns from the given examples. The molecule in question is a long-chain ester, specifically a decanoate ester.

From the examples, we observe that:

1. Long-chain hydrocarbons, such as alkanes and alkenes, tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCCCCCC(C)O has a property value of -1.98603165, and CCCCCCCC(C)O has a property value of -2.59160892.

2. Esters, such as COC(=O)c1cccnc1, have a property value of -0.1319181, and CCOC(=O)CC has a property value of 0.14103779. These values are closer to zero compared to long-chain hydrocarbons.

3. The presence of an ester functional group seems to slightly increase the property value compared to a similar hydrocarbon chain without the ester group.

Given these observations, the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is expected to have a property value that is negative but closer to zero than the long-chain hydrocarbons without the ester group. Considering the trend, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be around -1.0. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is approximately -1.0.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.7747640143780357
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxo group and a nitrogen atom. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings, heteroatoms, and carbonyl groups.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl and carbonyl groups) tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of heteroatoms like nitrogen and oxygen in a ring can also contribute to a more negative property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is likely to have a negative property value due to the electron-withdrawing effects of the chlorine and carbonyl groups, as well as the presence of the nitrogen atom in the heterocycle.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around -0.5.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.5334515877445639
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O). The presence of the nitro group is significant as it is an electron-withdrawing group, which can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have property values around -0.80611042. The presence of the nitro group tends to lower the property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

Considering the structural similarity and the influence of the nitro group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O would be around -0.8. However, given the specific examples and the need for a precise prediction, I would estimate the property value to be approximately:

-0.750

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 1.520098495299088
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples. The molecule in question appears to be a polycyclic compound with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and alcohols.

From the examples provided, it seems that larger, more complex polycyclic structures with multiple rings and functional groups tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C has a property value of 1.4621774, which is relatively high and is also a polycyclic compound with ketone groups.

Given the structural complexity and the presence of similar functional groups in the molecule CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would also be relatively high. Therefore, a predicted property value for this molecule could be around 1.4.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.2125270721156721
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A difluorobenzene moiety (Fc1cccc(F)c1), which is similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 with a property value of -0.05079107.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N), which is a common feature in several molecules but not directly comparable to any specific example.
- A chlorobenzene moiety (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), which is similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of -0.24554587.

The combination of these features suggests a balance between electron-withdrawing groups (fluorine and chlorine) and the amide linkage, which can influence the overall property value. The presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups typically results in a more negative property value.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be around -0.3.

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.18307360498508976
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with an alkyl chain, similar to some of the examples given.

Looking at the examples, we can see that simple aliphatic ethers and alcohols tend to have property values around zero or slightly negative. For instance, CCCCCO has a property value of 0.10080568, and CCCCCC(O)CC has a property value of -2.14402992, which is more negative due to the longer chain and additional functional groups.

Given that CCCOC(C)C is a relatively small ether with a branched structure, it is likely to have a property value closer to zero, but slightly negative due to the presence of the ether group and the branching.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C would be around -0.2.

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: -0.5385914519827391
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. The presence of a bromine atom and carbonyl groups suggests that the molecule might have a relatively low property value, as seen in some of the examples with halogens and carbonyls.

Looking at the examples:
- CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of -2.22938832, which is a bromine-substituted aromatic with a carbonyl group.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of -0.24554587, which is a chlorinated aromatic compound.
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of -1.00727542, which is an ester with an aromatic ring.

Considering these examples, the presence of the bromine atom and the carbonyl groups in the pyrrole ring likely contribute to a negative property value. The alkyl chain (CCC(C)) might slightly increase the property value compared to more polar or aromatic systems.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O would be around -1.5.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -2.5798880090938194
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups, aromaticity, and overall molecular size and complexity.

Biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic compound consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples provided, aromatic compounds with multiple rings or complex structures tend to have positive property values, while simpler or aliphatic compounds often have negative values.

For instance, the molecule c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67, which is a highly aromatic and complex structure, has a positive property value of 1.17103697. On the other hand, simpler aromatic compounds like Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34 have a positive value of 0.36918409.

Given that biphenyl is a simple aromatic compound with two phenyl rings, it is likely to have a positive property value, but not as high as the more complex aromatic structures. Based on the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around 0.3 to 0.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for biphenyl is approximately 0.4.

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.004703355839935056
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of molecular structures with different functional groups and sizes, and their property values range from highly negative to positive.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a sulfur atom at the end. This structure is similar to simple alkanes and alkyl chains, which tend to have negative property values in the examples provided. For instance, the molecule CCCCCCC=C has a property value of -2.30878216, and CCCCCCC(C)O has a value of -2.59160892. These examples suggest that linear or slightly branched alkanes with or without simple functional groups tend to have negative property values.

Considering the structure of CCCCCS, which is a simple alkyl chain with a sulfur atom, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. The presence of sulfur might slightly alter the value compared to a pure alkane, but it is unlikely to shift it to a positive value based on the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be around -2.0, considering the trend observed in similar structures.

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.5323237830605594
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with a tertiary carbon attached to an alcohol group. In the examples, similar structures include:

- CCC(C)(C)C, which has a property value of 0.07448592.
- CC(C)CC(C)O, which has a property value of -0.11499536.
- CCCC(C)(O)CC, which has a property value of -0.67499262.

The presence of the alcohol group generally tends to lower the property value compared to alkanes without functional groups. Given the examples, the property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is likely to be slightly negative, as the alcohol group introduces some polarity and potential hydrogen bonding.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO would be around -0.2.

Iteration: 11
SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -1.5475366566517652
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a naphthalene derivative, specifically 1-methyl-naphthalene.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds, particularly those with fused benzene rings like naphthalene, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (a similar naphthalene derivative) has a property value of -5.09261679, which is quite negative.

Given that Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is structurally similar to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 but lacks the additional methyl group on the second benzene ring, we can expect its property value to be in the same negative range, but likely less negative due to the absence of the additional methyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 would be around -4.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a cyclic compound with a urea-like structure, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -1.46118461. The main difference between the two structures is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the new molecule.

The addition of an alkyl chain generally increases hydrophobicity, which might slightly increase the property value. However, the core structure remains similar, and the property value is likely to be in the same range as the example.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be slightly higher than -1.46118461, but still negative due to the overall structure.

A predicted property value could be around -1.3.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.05079107348863629
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group is known to be electron-withdrawing due to the high electronegativity of fluorine atoms. This can influence the overall electronic properties of the molecule.

Looking at the examples, we can see that molecules with electron-withdrawing groups, such as halogens (Cl, Br, I) or nitro groups, tend to have negative property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of -1.1775318, and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of -0.31397969.

Given that the trifluoromethyl group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, we can expect the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 to be negative. However, the exact value will depend on the balance between the electron-withdrawing effect and the aromatic nature of the benzene ring.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around -0.5. This accounts for the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the trifluoromethyl group while also considering the stabilizing effect of the benzene ring.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a sugar alcohol, specifically a form of glucose, which is a polyol. It has multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups, which are polar and can form hydrogen bonds. This is similar to the example OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, which also contains multiple hydroxyl groups and has a property value of -0.87093697.

Given the structural similarity, particularly the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, we can predict that the property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O will be similar to that of the example with multiple hydroxyl groups.

Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately -0.87093697.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule appears to be a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters.

From the examples, we can observe that complex cyclic structures with multiple rings and functional groups tend to have positive property values, especially when they contain ketone groups and are relatively large. For instance, the molecule CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C has a property value of 1.61388474, which is a similar complex cyclic structure with ketone groups.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for the given molecule, CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C, is likely to be positive and in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 1.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic compound with multiple cyclohexane rings and a ketone group. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with multiple ring systems and ketone functionalities.

For instance, the molecule CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O has a property value of 1.05878181. This molecule also contains multiple cyclohexane rings and a hydroxyl group, similar to the target molecule.

Considering the structural similarities, particularly the presence of multiple rings and a ketone group, the property value for the target molecule is likely to be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O would be approximately 1.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O contains an acetamide group (CC(=O)N) attached to a nitro-substituted benzene ring. The presence of the nitro group (N(=O)=O) on the benzene ring is a significant feature, as it is known to be electron-withdrawing and can influence the overall property value.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with nitro groups on aromatic rings tend to have negative property values. For instance:
- O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of 0.11736052.
- O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12 has a property value of -1.83665571.
- COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.31547652.

The molecule in question is similar to COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which has a property value of -0.31547652, but with an acetamide group instead of a methoxy group. The acetamide group is less electron-donating than the methoxy group, which might lead to a slightly more negative property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O would be slightly more negative than -0.31547652. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.35.

True Property: 1.7292589465498827
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)SC)
- A chloro-substituted aromatic ring
- A heterocyclic structure with a naphthyridine-like moiety

From the examples, we observe:
- Molecules with halogenated aromatic rings, such as Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 and Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with heterocyclic structures, such as Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2 and COc2ncc1nccnc1n2, also tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of sulfur, as in CSSC, results in a significantly negative property value.

Considering these observations, the combination of a phosphorothioate group, a chloro-substituted aromatic ring, and a heterocyclic structure suggests a negative property value. The presence of sulfur and chlorine, both of which are associated with negative values in the examples, further supports this prediction.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be a negative value, likely in the range of -0.5 to -1.0. Given the structural complexity and the presence of multiple features associated with negative values, a specific prediction could be around -0.75.

True Property: 0.32530335428222756
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)(C)CO is tert-butanol, which is a simple alcohol with a tertiary carbon. In the examples, we have several alcohols and hydrocarbons with varying chain lengths and branching:

- CCC (propane) has a property value of 0.69923148.
- CC(C)CO (isobutanol) has a property value of 0.48304156.
- CCCCCCC(C)O (a longer chain alcohol) has a property value of -2.59160892.
- CCCCC(CC)CO (another longer chain alcohol) has a property value of -2.00283833.
- CCCCO (butanol) is not directly listed, but we can infer from the trend that longer chain alcohols tend to have more negative property values.

Given that tert-butanol (CC(C)(C)CO) is similar to isobutanol (CC(C)CO) but with an additional methyl group, we can expect its property value to be slightly more positive than isobutanol due to increased branching, which often leads to less negative or more positive property values.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO would be slightly higher than 0.48304156. Considering the trend and the structural similarity, a predicted property value could be around 0.55.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is a bicyclic compound with two nitrogen-containing heterocycles, specifically a purine-like structure. This type of structure is similar to nucleobases, which are generally polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding due to the presence of nitrogen atoms and carbonyl groups.

Looking at the examples, we can find some molecules with similar features:
- Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F has a property value of 0.30392071. This molecule contains a nitrogen heterocycle with a carbonyl group and an additional electronegative atom (fluorine).
- COc2ncc1nccnc1n2 has a property value of -0.71818185. This molecule is also a nitrogen-containing heterocycle with an oxygen atom.

Considering the structural similarities and the range of property values for nitrogen-containing heterocycles, the predicted property value for O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is likely to be in the range of these examples. Given the lack of additional electronegative atoms or large hydrophobic groups, the property value might be slightly negative.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is approximately -0.5.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.49185007490663585
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, an ester. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with ester groups (e.g., CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC, CCC(C)C(=O)C) tend to have negative property values.
- Smaller esters like CC(C)O (0.69979101) and CC(O)C(C)(C)C (0.02830637) have positive values, but they are alcohols rather than esters.
- The presence of an ester group in CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C (1.57611844) is associated with a positive value, but this is a complex structure with multiple rings.

Given that CC(C)OC=O is a simple ester, it is likely to have a negative property value, similar to other simple esters. However, it is smaller and less complex than some of the other esters with negative values.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around -0.2. This value reflects the negative trend seen in esters while accounting for the simplicity and small size of the molecule.

True Property: -0.8974398577359847
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diphenylurea, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a urea linkage.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with phenyl rings (aromatic rings) tend to have property values that are slightly positive or negative, depending on the presence of additional functional groups.
- The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) and amide linkages (N-C=O) often results in negative property values, as seen in several examples.
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings, as in biphenyl structures, tends to result in more negative property values, as seen in examples like Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (-5.09261679) and c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3 (-1.6302796).

Considering these observations, the molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 has two phenyl rings and a urea linkage, which is similar to an amide linkage. This suggests that the property value is likely to be negative, influenced by the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl groups and the aromatic rings.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 would be around -1.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13, which is triphenylene, we can analyze the given examples and their properties. The examples include a variety of aromatic compounds, some with additional functional groups and others that are purely hydrocarbon-based.

Triphenylene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) with a structure consisting of four fused benzene rings. It is similar to other aromatic compounds in the list, such as biphenyl (c1ccc2ccccc2c1) with a property value of 0.24116833. However, triphenylene is more complex due to its additional ring, which may affect its electronic properties and interactions.

Considering the examples, aromatic compounds with more complex structures or additional functional groups tend to have property values that are slightly positive or close to zero. Given that triphenylene is a larger aromatic system without additional functional groups that significantly alter its electronic nature, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly positive, reflecting its aromatic stability and electronic characteristics.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of triphenylene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13) is approximately 0.25.

True Property: -0.751005800956054
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N), an aromatic ring, and amine groups, which can influence its electronic and steric properties.

From the examples, molecules with similar functional groups, such as sulfonamides and aromatic amines, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O has a property value of -1.70264245, and it contains a nitro group and a heterocyclic ring, which are somewhat similar in electronic nature to the sulfonamide and amine groups in the target molecule.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is likely to be negative. A reasonable estimate, based on the trends observed, would be around -1.5.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.3624700293157193
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is known to generally increase the electron-withdrawing character and can lead to a more negative property value.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which is also a strong electron-withdrawing group, contributing to a more negative property value.
- An alkene group (C=C) and an amine group (CCN), which can have varying effects depending on the context but are generally less impactful than the nitro and trifluoromethyl groups.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (0.0212474) and Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O (0.56836266), show a range of property values, but the presence of multiple nitro groups and a trifluoromethyl group in the target molecule suggests a more negative value.
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like trifluoromethyl and nitro groups in other examples tends to result in negative property values.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative and more negative than those with fewer electron-withdrawing groups. A reasonable estimate would be around -1.5 to -2.0, given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents.

Therefore, the predicted specific property value is approximately -1.8.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl acetate, an ester. Esters in the examples provided have varying property values, but we can look for similar structures to make a prediction. For instance, the molecule CC(C)CCOC=O (an ester with a similar functional group) has a property value of -0.12864119. 

Considering the structural similarity and the presence of the ester functional group, the property value for CC(C)OC=O is likely to be close to that of other esters. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around -0.1. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O is approximately -0.1.

True Property: -0.24591436406590253
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples.

1. **Aromatic Ring**: The molecule contains a benzene ring, which is common in several examples. Aromatic rings often contribute to a moderate property value, typically around -0.7 to 0.3 in the examples.

2. **Substituents**: The molecule has two methyl groups and one hydroxyl group attached to the benzene ring. The presence of hydroxyl groups, as seen in some examples, tends to lower the property value, often resulting in negative values. Methyl groups, on the other hand, can slightly increase the property value, but their effect is generally less pronounced than that of hydroxyl groups.

3. **Comparison with Examples**: 
   - The molecule Cc1ccccc1O (phenol) has a property value of 0.34570381.
   - The molecule c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC has a property value of -0.58981051, indicating that additional hydroxyl groups can significantly lower the property value.
   - The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1 (1,3-dimethylbenzene) has a property value of -0.73334879, suggesting that methyl groups alone do not significantly increase the property value.

Considering these factors, the presence of the hydroxyl group is likely to have a more substantial impact than the methyl groups, leading to a negative property value. However, the effect may not be as pronounced as in molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be around -0.5.

- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl: 0.91432163

These examples suggest that the presence of the phosphorothioate group tends to contribute positively to the property value. Additionally, the molecule has a methoxy group (OC) and a thiomethyl group (SC) attached to a benzene ring, which can influence the property value.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of the phosphorothioate group, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be positive and in a similar range to the examples provided. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately:

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with multiple chlorine atoms attached to the aromatic rings. In the examples, similar chlorinated aromatic compounds, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, have property values around 0.6 to 0.8.

Given the structural similarity and the degree of chlorination, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be approximately 0.7.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group attached to the terminal carbon. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have negative property values, such as O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O with a value of -0.89696702.
- Simple aliphatic chains like CCC (propane) have a positive property value of 0.69923148, but the presence of a nitro group is likely to decrease this value.

Considering these observations, the presence of the nitro group in CCCN(=O)=O will likely result in a negative property value, but not as negative as molecules with multiple nitro groups or more complex aromatic systems.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around -0.5.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.28044722361783236
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent. 

Looking at the examples, we have:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 with a property value of -0.70901166
- COc1cccc(Cl)c1 with a property value of -0.28845559
- COc1ccccc1Cl with a property value of -0.29422212
- Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O with a property value of -0.20436043

The presence of halogens (Cl, Br) in aromatic rings tends to result in negative property values. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but with a fluorine atom instead of a chlorine atom. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which might slightly increase the negativity of the property value compared to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be slightly more negative than -0.70901166. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.75.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with an additional hydroxyl group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CC1CCCO1, which is a cyclopentanol, and has a property value of 0.11008826. However, the bicyclic structure and the presence of a tertiary alcohol group might increase the property value due to increased steric hindrance and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 would be slightly higher than that of CC1CCCO1. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.15.

- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)
- An amide linkage (N2C(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)

Comparing this structure to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 1.86871553, we notice that both molecules share the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage with a phenyl ring. However, the example molecule has an additional thioether linkage (SC(CCl)), which is absent in the target molecule.

Given the structural similarities and the absence of the thioether linkage, the property value for the target molecule is likely to be slightly lower than 1.86871553. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be approximately:

This molecule is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, specifically a methylated benzotriazole.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings and heterocycles tend to have a range of property values, often influenced by the presence of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups. The presence of a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle suggests a potential for moderate to slightly positive property values, as seen in some of the examples with similar functional groups.

Considering the examples and the structural features of the given molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around 0.2. This value reflects the influence of the aromatic and heterocyclic components, along with the carbonyl group, on the overall property.

Looking at the examples, we can find similar structures:

1. CCCCCCC(=O)OC, which is a similar ester with a slightly different alkyl group, has a property value of -1.15946146.
2. CCCCC, a simple alkane with 5 carbon atoms, has a property value of 0.17462922.
3. CCCCCCCCI, a linear alkane with an iodine atom, has a property value of -0.93871071.

Considering the structural similarity to CCCCCCC(=O)OC and the fact that esters tend to have negative property values in this dataset, we can predict that CCCCCCC(=O)OCC will also have a negative property value, likely close to that of CCCCCCC(=O)OC.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately -1.1.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with ester groups tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 has a property value of -1.26670695, and CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of -1.00727542. Both of these examples are esters with aromatic rings, similar to methyl benzoate.

Given this pattern, we can predict that the property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 will also be negative and likely close to the values of similar compounds. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -1.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are likely related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some aspect of the molecule's electronic or steric properties.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear conjugated diene, which is a relatively simple structure. In the examples, simple alkenes and aromatic compounds tend to have property values around zero, with some variation depending on the presence of additional functional groups or substituents.

For instance, the molecule C=Cc1ccccc1 (styrene) has a property value of 0.04054965, which is close to zero. Similarly, the molecule C1CCCC1 (cyclopentane) has a property value of 0.11697428, also near zero. These examples suggest that simple hydrocarbons without strong electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups tend to have property values near zero.

Given that C=CCC=C is a simple conjugated diene without additional functional groups, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be close to zero. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C is approximately:

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: -0.7524670757257472
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br, also known as tribromomethane or bromoform, is a simple halogenated compound with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the provided examples, halogenated aromatic compounds like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 have a property value of -4.62521034, indicating a strong negative value. However, this is for an aromatic system, which is more complex than a simple alkane derivative like BrC(Br)Br.

Considering the simplicity of BrC(Br)Br and the presence of multiple bromine atoms, we can expect the property value to be negative, but not as extreme as the aromatic halogenated compound. The presence of multiple bromine atoms, which are heavy and electronegative, likely contributes to a more negative property value compared to simpler alkanes or less halogenated compounds.

Based on this reasoning and the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around -2.5. This accounts for the significant influence of the bromine atoms while considering the simplicity of the molecule compared to more complex aromatic systems.

- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 1.72016123.
- A thioester linkage (SC(CCl)), which is not directly present in the examples but can be considered similar to other sulfur-containing groups.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is present in several examples with varying effects on the property value.
- A bicyclic lactam structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O), which is similar to the example CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O, with a property value of -0.24762004.

Considering these features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a positive contribution, while the bicyclic lactam and chlorinated carbon may have a neutral to slightly negative effect.

Balancing these influences, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 0.8.

- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C), which is present in the example CC=C(C)C with a property value of 0.48971682.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of electron-withdrawing groups (like the chlorine and the heterocyclic ring) and electron-donating groups (like the dimethylamide and tert-butyl) will have competing effects on the property value.

Balancing these influences, the predicted property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C is likely to be slightly positive, but close to zero due to the mixed effects of the groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately 0.15.

Given the structural similarity and the influence of chlorine atoms, the predicted property value for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is likely to be in the negative range, similar to the example with multiple chlorines. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately -2.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCOCC is a simple linear ether, similar to other small aliphatic compounds in the list.

For instance, CCC(O)CC has a property value of 0.12458433, and CC(C)O has a property value of 0.69979101. These values suggest that small aliphatic compounds with oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have positive property values, but not very high.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

This molecule is a tertiary amide with a central carbonyl group (C=O) connected to a nitrogen atom, which is further connected to a bulky tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)c1ccccc1) and a phenyl group (c2ccccc2). The presence of aromatic rings and the tert-butyl group suggests some degree of hydrophobicity, while the amide group introduces some polar character.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar structural features, such as aromatic rings and amide groups, tend to have property values around the range of 0.5 to 1.0. For instance, the molecule CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 has a property value of 0.79932696, and it shares the amide linkage and aromatic rings.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be around 0.7 to 0.9. Given the specific examples and their values, I would predict a property value of approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-), which is a common feature in several molecules.
- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1), which is also present in some of the examples.

From the examples:
- Molecules with bromine, such as Fc1cccc(Br)c1 (-0.28044722) and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.31397969), tend to have slightly negative property values.
- The presence of an acetamide group, as seen in CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (0.10691465), can contribute to a slightly positive or neutral property value.

Considering these observations, the combination of the acetamide group and the bromobenzene moiety in CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 suggests a property value that is likely slightly negative, influenced by the bromine atom, but not as negative as molecules with multiple bromine atoms or other strongly negative features.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around -0.2.

The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is structurally similar to cumene (CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1), which has a property value of -1.417283. However, the isobutyl group in CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is slightly different from the isopropyl group in cumene, which might affect the property value slightly.

Considering these similarities and the trend in the examples, the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is likely to be close to that of cumene but slightly less negative due to the additional carbon in the isobutyl group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 would be around -1.2.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have negative property values. However, benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which is less electron-withdrawing compared to nitro groups. Additionally, benzaldehyde is a relatively simple aromatic compound without additional substituents that might significantly alter its electronic properties.

Considering the examples, simple aromatic compounds like COc1ccccc1 (anisole) have a slightly positive property value (0.10099994), while more complex or substituted aromatic compounds tend to have more negative values. Given that benzaldehyde is a simple aromatic compound with a moderately electron-withdrawing group, we can predict its property value to be slightly negative, but not as negative as those with strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) would be around -0.1.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -2.5580835433305533
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is often associated with negative property values in the examples.
- An oxazole ring, which is a five-membered heterocyclic compound containing an oxygen and a nitrogen atom. This is similar to some of the heterocyclic structures in the examples.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is present in several examples with varying property values.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2, tend to have negative property values.
- Heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen and oxygen, like Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, also show negative values.
- The presence of an amide linkage can contribute to a range of values, but in combination with the other features, it might lean towards a negative value.

Based on these observations, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is likely to be negative. A reasonable estimate, considering the structural similarities and trends, would be around -0.5.

True Property: -1.9932012939027386
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group. This structure is similar to the example N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -2.48309048. The main difference between the two is the presence of a double-bonded nitrogen in the example, which is not present in the molecule we are analyzing.

The removal of the double bond in the hydrazine group typically results in a less electron-withdrawing effect compared to the azo group (N=N). This could lead to a less negative property value compared to the example with the azo group.

Considering these structural differences and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would likely be less negative than -2.48309048. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around -2.0.

True Property: -4.035429314986975
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a relatively small and rigid structure with two carbonyl groups and a cyclohexane ring. In the examples, similar cyclic structures with carbonyl groups, such as O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, have property values around -0.16862193. Another example, O=C1CCCN1, has a property value of 0.33024958.

Considering the structural similarity to these examples, particularly the diketopiperazine structure, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be close to these values. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.3. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately 0.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, tend to have higher property values (0.79484712).
2. Simple chlorinated benzenes, like Clc1ccccc1Cl, have a property value of -0.25111149.
3. The presence of additional aromatic rings or complex structures can increase the property value, as seen in Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl.

Given that Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a more complex structure than Clc1ccccc1Cl and has multiple chlorine atoms, we can expect its property value to be higher than -0.25111149. However, it is likely lower than the highly chlorinated and more complex structure with a value of 0.79484712.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 0.3 to 0.5. Let's choose a specific value within this range:

True Property: -1.954419294143413
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Simple aromatic compounds like Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) have a property value of 0.0343626.
- Linear alkanes and simple ethers like CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 (dodecylbenzene) have a property value of -0.98666393.
- The presence of additional alkyl groups tends to slightly increase the property value compared to the base aromatic compound.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a diethylbenzene, it is structurally similar to the simpler aromatic compounds but with additional alkyl groups. This suggests that its property value might be slightly higher than that of aniline but not as high as more complex or functionalized aromatic compounds.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be around 0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is a sulfonamide derivative, which contains a benzene ring (phenyl group) attached to a sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values, likely due to their electron-withdrawing nature and potential for resonance stabilization.

For instance, the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.02821266, and Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.78077233. Both contain nitro groups attached to aromatic rings, similar to the sulfonamide group in the target molecule.

Considering these structural similarities and the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O will also be negative, likely in a similar range to the nitro-substituted aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is approximately -0.05.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically triphenylene. It consists of three fused benzene rings forming a planar structure. In the examples, similar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 (with a property value of 0.48192417) and c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 (with a property value of 0.64085624), have positive property values.

Given the structural similarity to these examples, particularly the second one, which is also a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a similar number of rings and aromatic character, we can predict that the property value for triphenylene (c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34) will also be positive and likely in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 is approximately 0.6.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the more complex aromatic structures in the examples, particularly those with multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings, which tend to have higher property values.

For instance, the molecule OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5 has a property value of 1.93321048, and it contains multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups. Another example, Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4, has a property value of 0.86599669, and it also features multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings, the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 is likely to be relatively high. However, it may not be as high as the most complex examples due to the absence of additional substituents like bromine or chlorine, which can further increase the property value.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 0.9.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphoric acid ester group (P=O with OC and NC).
- A thioester linkage (SC).
- An acetyl group (C=O with CH3).

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with phosphoric acid ester groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (0.91432163) and CCN(CC)C(=O)C(=CCOP(=O)(OC)OC)Cl (0.77133528), tend to have positive property values.
- Molecules with thioester linkages, such as CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C (1.92412818), also have positive property values.
- The presence of an acetyl group (C=O with CH3) is common in several molecules, but its influence on the property value is less clear without additional context.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is likely to have a positive property value. Given the presence of both a phosphoric acid ester and a thioester linkage, the property value is expected to be moderately positive.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is approximately 0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is a simple alkene with two chlorine atoms attached to the carbon-carbon double bond. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, tend to have positive property values. However, the complexity and size of the molecule also play a role in determining the property value.

Given that Cl\C=C/Cl is a relatively small and simple molecule with two chlorine atoms, it is likely to have a property value that is positive but not as high as more complex chlorinated compounds. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around 0.5.

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 0.49793681758437297
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and their properties. Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle similar to benzene but with a nitrogen atom replacing one of the carbon atoms in the ring. 

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as CNc1ccccc1 (aniline), have a property value of 0.00100279, and c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 (a more complex nitrogen-containing aromatic compound) has a property value of -2.14499717. The presence of nitrogen in an aromatic ring seems to have a varying effect on the property value, depending on the structure and additional substituents.

Considering pyridine's structure, which is simpler than the more complex nitrogen-containing aromatic compound but more similar to aniline, we can predict that its property value will be closer to that of aniline, but slightly more negative due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitrogen atom in the ring.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of pyridine (c1ccncc1) would be slightly negative, around -0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has several key features:
1. An ester linkage (OC(=O)).
2. A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1).
3. An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23).
4. A pyridine-like structure (ccnc).
5. A chlorine substituent on an aromatic ring.

From the examples:
- Molecules with ester linkages, such as CCCCCC(=O)OC (-0.17514143) and CCCOC(=O)CC (-0.25432933), tend to have slightly negative property values.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2 (-0.89480355) and O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 (-0.89743986), also tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of a chlorine atom on an aromatic ring, as seen in Clc1ccc(I)cc1 (-1.1775318) and Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl (0.39793562), can influence the property value, often making it more negative.

Considering these factors, the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 is likely to have a negative property value due to the combination of ester and amide linkages, as well as the presence of a chlorine atom on an aromatic ring.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -1.0.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 0.10080568274970574
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the trends in the given examples. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear aliphatic alcohol, specifically 1-pentanol. In the examples, we observe that linear aliphatic hydrocarbons and alcohols tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule CCCCC(=O)CCCC has a property value of -3.91556748, and OC1CCCCCCC1 has a property value of -2.60124395. 

Given that CCCCCO is a smaller molecule compared to these examples, we can expect its property value to be less negative. However, it is still likely to be negative due to its aliphatic nature and the presence of the alcohol group, which is less polar than other functional groups like carbonyls or nitro groups that tend to have more positive values.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be around -2.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and functional groups present in the molecule and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is often associated with polar and electron-withdrawing characteristics.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which can also contribute to polarity and hydrogen bonding.
- An aromatic ring (phenyl group), which can influence the electronic distribution and overall stability of the molecule.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can add to the molecule's polarity.

Based on the examples provided, molecules with polar functional groups and aromatic rings tend to have property values that are not extremely high or low, often around the range of -1 to 1. Considering the presence of both electron-withdrawing and polar groups, along with the aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be slightly positive or close to neutral.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be around 0.5.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:

1. **Aromatic Ring**: The presence of a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) is a common feature in many of the examples, often associated with negative property values.

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The presence of a nitro group is known to influence the property value, often making it more negative, as seen in examples like Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-0.20436043).

3. **Ester Groups (C(=O)OC)**: The presence of ester groups can contribute to a positive property value, as seen in examples like CCCCCC(=O)OC (-0.17514143) and CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC (1.49791371).

4. **Heterocyclic Ring with Nitrogen**: The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring can also influence the property value, as seen in examples like c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2 (-0.27635057).

5. **Substituents on the Aromatic Ring**: The presence of substituents like methyl groups (C) on the aromatic ring can also affect the property value, as seen in examples like CC(C)c1ccccc1C (-1.43196288).

Considering these features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the molecule in question is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative due to the presence of the nitro group and the aromatic ring, but not as negative as some of the more heavily substituted aromatic compounds.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two carbonyl groups (C=O) and two nitrogen atoms in a six-membered ring. This structure is relatively small and compact, with no large hydrophobic or aromatic groups, which suggests it might have a property value closer to those of smaller, less complex molecules in the examples.

Looking at the examples, smaller molecules with carbonyl groups and nitrogen atoms, such as CCNC(=S)NCC (-0.53615244) and CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (-4.16563914), tend to have negative property values. However, the diketopiperazine structure is more stable and less polar than some of these examples, which might result in a less negative value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.5. This value reflects the molecule's small size, presence of carbonyl groups, and lack of large hydrophobic or aromatic groups.

SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 0.658225216317875
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of molecular structures with different functional groups and sizes, and their property values range from negative to positive.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure consisting of a chloroethane group. In the examples, simpler aliphatic hydrocarbons like CCCCC have a small positive property value (0.17462922), while aromatic compounds with halogens, such as Clc1ccccc1, have a slightly positive value (0.13227455). However, more complex halogenated compounds can have negative values, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (-1.90159521).

Given the simplicity of ClCC and its similarity to small aliphatic compounds, it is reasonable to predict a small positive property value, but the presence of chlorine, which can sometimes lead to negative values, suggests caution.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be slightly positive, around 0.1.

The molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a pyridine ring and a trichloromethyl group. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms and a nitrogen atom in the aromatic ring suggests that the molecule might have a property value similar to other chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.

Looking at the examples:
- Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -0.29539329.
- Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of -1.07138348.
- Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2 has a property value of -2.05921827.

The presence of the pyridine nitrogen might slightly alter the property compared to a purely chlorinated benzene ring. However, the overall electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine atoms and the aromatic nature of the compound suggest a negative property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl would be around -0.5 to -1.0. Given the examples, a specific prediction could be:

The molecule CCCCC(C)O is a primary alcohol with a five-carbon chain and a hydroxyl group attached to the second carbon. This structure is similar to the example molecule CCCC(O)CCC, which has a property value of -0.88211929. Both molecules are alcohols with similar carbon chain lengths, although the position of the hydroxyl group differs slightly.

Considering the structural similarity and the influence of the hydroxyl group, the property value for CCCCC(C)O is likely to be close to that of CCCC(O)CCC. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCC(C)O would be approximately -0.88.

To predict the property value for the molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is 1,4-dibromobenzene, which is a simple aromatic compound with two bromine atoms attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Simple aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have property values around the range of -0.8 to 0.6.
2. The presence of multiple halogen atoms, especially heavier ones like bromine, tends to increase the property value compared to lighter halogens like chlorine.

For instance:
- ClCCl (dichloromethane) has a property value of 0.61578385.
- ClC(Cl)Cl (chloroform) has a property value of 0.43910176.
- ClC(=C)Cl (1,1-dichloroethylene) has a property value of 0.66763506.

Considering the above examples and the fact that bromine is heavier than chlorine, we can expect the property value for 1,4-dibromobenzene to be slightly higher than those of similar chlorinated compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around 0.7.

Considering the pattern from the examples, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value. However, since the molecule in question has fewer chlorine atoms than the example, we can expect the property value to be somewhat lower than 1.29582297.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately 1.0.

The presence of aromatic rings and a phosphate ester linkage suggests that the molecule might have a property value similar to other aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups.

Looking at the examples, aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1 (1.17308551) and COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (0.83008854), tend to have positive property values. The presence of the phosphate group, which is electron-withdrawing, might increase the property value further.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1 is likely to be positive and in the range of similar aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 1.0.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.4073827995930236
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to be electron-withdrawing and can increase the lipophilicity of the molecule.
- An aromatic ring, which is common in many of the examples.
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle, which is similar to some of the examples.
- Chlorine atoms, which are also present in several examples and can influence the electronic properties.

Looking at the examples, molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (NO2) or trifluoromethyl (CF3) often have negative property values, indicating a potential decrease in some property (possibly related to solubility or electronic effects). However, the presence of chlorine and aromatic rings can sometimes lead to positive values, as seen in some examples.

Considering these factors, the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero, due to the balance between the electron-withdrawing effects and the presence of aromatic and chlorine groups.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.1.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.315476517468166
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring, with a nitro group (NO2) also attached to the ring.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of electron-donating groups, such as methoxy groups, can influence the property value, often making it less positive or even negative, depending on the overall structure.

In the examples, the molecule O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which is dinitrobenzene, has a property value of -0.28671763. The presence of two nitro groups makes it more electron-withdrawing, leading to a slightly negative value.

The molecule c1ccccc1O, which is phenol, has a property value of 0.34570381. The hydroxyl group is an electron-donating group, which increases the property value.

Considering the structure of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, the methoxy group is electron-donating, while the nitro group is electron-withdrawing. The balance between these groups will determine the property value. Given the examples, the presence of both groups suggests a property value that is likely close to neutral but slightly positive due to the influence of the nitro group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is approximately 0.15.

Predicting the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. This molecule is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 0.04889528.

The given molecule has a similar structure but with more chlorine atoms, which generally increases the electron-withdrawing effect and could potentially affect the property value. However, without specific details on how the property is calculated, it's challenging to predict the exact value. Based on the trend observed in the examples, the property value for this molecule is likely to be slightly higher than 0.04889528 due to the increased chlorination.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl would be approximately 0.1.

The presence of the ester group in CCCOC=O suggests it might have a property value in a similar range.

Considering the relatively simple structure of CCCOC=O compared to the more complex esters in the examples, it is likely to have a property value closer to the lower end of the range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be around -0.5.

For instance, CCCCC(CC)C=O has a property value of -1.50580041, and CCCCCCc1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.98666393. These examples suggest that the presence of a long aliphatic chain contributes to a more negative property value.

Given that CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is a decanoate ester, it is likely to have a property value in the negative range, similar to other long-chain aliphatic compounds. Considering the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around -1.0. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately -1.0.

- Molecules with phenol groups, such as Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, also have negative property values. The example given has a property value of -1.03264228.

Considering these observations, the presence of both a nitro group and a phenol group in the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O suggests that the property value will likely be negative. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.2 to -0.3.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.25.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a pyridine derivative with a carbonyl group attached to a hydrazine moiety.

1. **Aromatic Ring**: The molecule contains a pyridine ring, similar to some of the examples. Pyridine rings often contribute to negative property values, as seen in examples like c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 (-2.14499717) and Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2 (-0.25041243).

2. **Carbonyl Group**: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) can influence the property value. In the examples, carbonyl groups are present in molecules with both positive and negative property values, so the effect can vary depending on the context.

3. **Hydrazine Moiety**: The hydrazine group (NN) is less common in the examples, but it can introduce additional electron-donating or withdrawing effects, potentially leading to a more negative property value.

4. **Overall Structure**: The combination of a pyridine ring with a carbonyl and hydrazine group suggests a potential for a moderately negative property value, as the electron-withdrawing nature of the pyridine and carbonyl could dominate.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be around -0.5. This accounts for the electron-withdrawing effects and the overall structural similarity to other negatively valued examples.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Several alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, have a positive property value (0.70934776).
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, have a positive property value (0.15745717).
- Molecules with piperidine rings, such as Cn2c(=O)n(C)c1ncn(CC(O)CO)c1c2=O, have a negative property value (-0.44808268).

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property value, the presence of both positive and negative contributing groups suggests a property value that is likely close to neutral but slightly positive due to the presence of the phosphorothioate group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is approximately 0.15.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -1.8508374576453257
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (octane), we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The examples suggest that aliphatic hydrocarbons, particularly linear alkanes, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCO (heptanol) has a property value of -0.93736184, and CCCCCC/C=C/C (a linear alkene) has a property value of -0.3130807. 

Given that octane is a simple linear alkane, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and likely similar to other linear hydrocarbons. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (octane) would be around -1.0, considering the trend of decreasing property values with increasing chain length in linear alkanes. 

Thus, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCC is approximately -1.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbonyl group (C=O), as well as an alkyne group (C#C). The presence of these functional groups and the overall structure can influence the property value.

From the examples, we observe that polycyclic compounds with hydroxyl and carbonyl groups tend to have positive property values. For instance:
- CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C has a property value of 1.48278867.
- CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O has a property value of 1.28275978.

The presence of an alkyne group (C#C) might slightly reduce the property value compared to similar structures without it, but the overall influence of the polycyclic structure and the functional groups is likely to result in a positive property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C would be around 1.2.

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups. Based on the examples provided, molecules with complex polycyclic structures and multiple oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule with the highest property value in the examples is a large polycyclic structure with multiple oxygen atoms.

True Property: 0.0329777834225451
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which consists of a phenol group (a benzene ring with an -OH group) and a chlorine atom attached to the benzene ring. Let's consider the examples:

1. Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (nitrophenol) has a property value of 0.0212474.
2. Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (another nitrophenol) has a property value of 0.0167828.
3. Clc1ccccc1I (iodochlorobenzene) has a property value of -1.18956549.
4. Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) has a property value of 0.36528105.
5. Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (dichlorobiphenyl) has a property value of -1.76373558.

The presence of the hydroxyl group (-OH) in phenols generally increases the polarity and can affect the property value. The chlorine atom, being electronegative, also influences the property value, but its effect can vary depending on the overall structure.

Considering the examples, the presence of both an -OH group and a halogen (Cl) on a benzene ring suggests a property value that might be slightly negative or close to zero, as seen in the nitrophenol examples. However, the specific combination of -OH and Cl might lead to a slightly more negative value compared to the nitrophenols due to the electron-withdrawing nature of chlorine.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be slightly negative, around -0.1 to -0.2. Therefore, a specific predicted property value could be:

-0.15

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 contains:
- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C)
- An ester linkage (OC(=O))
- An amide linkage (NC(=O))
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens (e.g., Cl, F) tend to have positive property values, especially when multiple halogens are present.
- The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) in esters and amides can influence the property value, often making it more negative.
- The presence of alkyne groups is not directly represented in the examples, but they can contribute to a more negative property due to their electron-withdrawing nature.

Considering these factors, the molecule has both electron-withdrawing groups (carbonyl, alkyne) and electron-donating groups (aromatic ring with halogens). The presence of two chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring suggests a potential for a positive contribution, but the overall structure with the alkyne and carbonyl groups may lead to a more negative value.

Based on these considerations, I would predict a property value slightly negative, balancing the effects of the electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups.

- Molecules with phenyl rings and halogen substituents tend to have negative property values, such as Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (-0.24554587) and Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.70901166).
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings like pyrimidine (e.g., Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2, -0.27655245) also tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings and halogens generally results in negative values, as seen in Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc2Cl (0.6341406), which is an exception due to its high degree of chlorination.

Considering these observations, the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of multiple aromatic rings, halogen substituents, and a heterocyclic ring.

Based on the trends from the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.5.

The structure of CCCCCOC=O is similar to CCCCCCC=O, but with one fewer carbon in the chain and an ether linkage. The presence of the ether oxygen might slightly alter the property value compared to a simple ketone or aldehyde. However, given the similarity in structure and the trend observed in the examples, the property value is likely to be close to that of CCCCCCC=O.

- ClCCCl (1,2-dichloroethane) with a property value of 0.36309076.
- CCBr (bromoethane) with a property value of 0.3674267.

Both of these molecules are small halogenated hydrocarbons, similar to ClCCl. Given that ClCCl is even smaller and more symmetrical than ClCCCl, we can expect its property value to be in a similar range, but potentially slightly lower due to its smaller size and higher symmetry.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around 0.35.

From the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with phenol groups (e.g., Oc1cccc(O)c1) tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of additional electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups can influence the property value.

The molecule Oc1cccc(O)c1 has a property value of 0.26663563, and it is a simple phenol. The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is similar but has an additional methyl group, which is an electron-donating group. This could slightly increase the property value compared to phenol alone.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be slightly higher than that of Oc1cccc(O)c1. Therefore, a predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O could be around 0.3.

- Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.40445131.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.63682616.
- Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of -2.56331657.

The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a biphenyl with four chlorine atoms, similar to the second example, which has a property value of 0.63682616. The first example, with a similar structure but more chlorine atoms, has a slightly lower property value of 0.40445131.

True Property: 0.4897168248292955
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple hydrocarbon with a branched structure and a double bond. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons and alkenes tend to have negative property values. For instance, the linear alkenes and alkanes like CCCCCCCC=C (-2.19663011) and CCCCCCCC (-1.85083746) have negative values. The presence of a double bond and a branched structure in isoprene might slightly affect the property value compared to linear alkenes.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC=C(C)C is likely to be negative, similar to other simple hydrocarbons. A reasonable estimate for the property value of isoprene could be around -1.5, given its structural similarity to other hydrocarbons with negative values.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC=C(C)C is approximately -1.5.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.6157838526221131
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of organic molecules with different functional groups and structural features. The property values seem to be related to some physicochemical property, possibly related to solubility, partition coefficient, or another molecular descriptor.

The molecule ClCCl is dichloromethane, a simple chlorinated hydrocarbon. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl and ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl), have positive property values. This suggests that the presence of chlorine atoms might contribute positively to the property value.

Given the simplicity of ClCCl compared to the more complex chlorinated compounds in the examples, and considering the trend of positive values for chlorinated compounds, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be slightly positive.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCCl is approximately 0.1.

True Property: 2.162292055250614
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as aromatic rings. The presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters, and phenols) suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and polar interactions, which can influence the property value.

From the examples provided, molecules with complex polycyclic structures and multiple oxygen functionalities tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O has a property value of 0.68601454, and O=c2c(C3CCCc4ccccc43)c(O)c1ccccc1o2 has a property value of 0.88447333.

Given the structural complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing groups in the target molecule, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. Considering the examples and the structural features, a predicted property value for the molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 could be approximately:

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.41989385649545286
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A thioether group (CS-)
- A pyrazole ring (1,2,4-triazole-like structure)
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- A tertiary butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with bulky alkyl groups (like tertiary butyl) can have positive or slightly negative values depending on other functional groups.
- The presence of heteroatoms like sulfur and nitrogen in rings can influence the property value, often leading to negative values.

Considering these factors, the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C has a combination of features that suggest a slightly negative property value due to the presence of the carbonyl group and the heterocyclic ring, despite the bulky alkyl group.

Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be around -0.2.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -1.0072754241941122
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ester group (COOC) attached to a benzene ring. In the examples, we have several molecules with aromatic rings and ester groups, such as:

- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2, which has a property value of 1.39067613.
- CCCCCC(=O)OC, which is a simple ester, has a property value of -0.71838083.
- CCCCCC(=O)OCC, another ester, has a property value of -0.84471038.

The presence of the aromatic ring in CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 suggests that the property value might be influenced by the aromaticity, similar to other aromatic compounds in the examples. However, the ester group tends to have a negative influence on the property value, as seen in the examples with esters.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is likely to be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the ester group, but not as negative as the more complex or highly substituted aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.5.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -1.9008609657090523
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, chain length, and aromaticity.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached, making it a bromoalkane. In the examples, linear alkanes and their derivatives tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCCCCCCCO has a property value of -0.93736184, and CCCCCCC=C has a value of -0.93780326. The presence of a bromine atom, which is more electronegative than carbon and hydrogen, might slightly alter the property value compared to a simple alkane.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be slightly negative, similar to other linear alkanes and their derivatives. A reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around -0.9.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.0537880379128517
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for carbon monoxide (CO) based on the examples provided is challenging due to the lack of direct correlation between the molecular structure of CO and the examples given. However, we can make an educated guess by considering the nature of CO as a small, simple molecule.

Carbon monoxide is a diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen, making it quite stable and non-polar. In the context of the examples, smaller and simpler molecules tend to have property values closer to zero, often slightly positive or negative depending on their specific characteristics.

Given this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO could be around 0.0, with a slight positive or negative deviation. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately:

0.05
