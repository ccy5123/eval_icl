From the examples, we observe that:
- Long-chain hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values (e.g., CCCCCCC, -1.40536612; CCCCCCCC(C)O, -0.94699574).
- Esters with aromatic rings tend to have positive property values (e.g., COC(=O)c1cccnc1, 0.40710363; CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, 0.58137788).

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is similar to CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which has a property value of 0.58137788. Given that the molecule in question is slightly shorter, we might expect a slightly lower value, but still positive due to the ester functional group.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxo group and a nitrogen atom. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings, heteroatoms, and halogen substituents.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have positive property values, especially when multiple halogens are present.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.5354017162645509
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O). The presence of the nitro group is significant because it is an electron-withdrawing group, which can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have positive property values (0.84021327). This suggests that the presence of a nitro group tends to increase the property value.

Considering the structural similarity and the influence of the nitro group, I would predict that the property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is likely to be positive, but not as high as the example with an aromatic ring, which provides additional stabilization.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O would be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples. The molecule in question appears to be a polycyclic compound with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and alcohols.

From the examples provided, it seems that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and complex cyclic structures tend to have positive property values, especially when they contain multiple rings and functional groups like ketones. For instance, the molecule Cc1cc2c3ccccc3ccc2c4ccccc14 has a property value of 1.17512216, and the molecule CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C has a property value of 0.90216431.

Given the structural complexity and the presence of ketone groups, which are common in molecules with positive property values, I would predict that the property value for the molecule CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO is likely to be positive and similar to those of other complex cyclic structures.

Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as functional groups, molecular size, and electronic effects. The molecule in question, CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, contains several notable features:

1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P=S)**: This group can influence the electronic properties of the molecule, potentially affecting its reactivity and interactions.

2. **Thioether Linkage (SC)**: This linkage can contribute to the molecule's lipophilicity and stability.

The presence of the hydroxyl group (-OH) tends to increase the property value, likely due to its polar nature and ability to form hydrogen bonds.

Given that tert-butanol is a small, simple alcohol, we can expect its property value to be similar to that of other small alcohols. Considering the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO would be slightly higher than that of CC(C)CO, due to the increased steric bulk and branching, which might slightly affect the property.

- An alkylamine group (CCN(CC(C)=C)), which can have a neutral to slightly negative influence on the property value.

Based on the examples provided, molecules with nitro groups and electron-withdrawing groups like trifluoromethyl tend to have property values that are less negative or even positive. For instance, the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.05137674, and the presence of additional electron-withdrawing groups like trifluoromethyl could push the value further positive.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O is likely to be slightly positive. A reasonable estimate would be around 0.1.

True Property: 0.5970641349456857
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. Esters generally have a range of property values depending on their specific structure. In the examples, we have a few esters and similar functional groups:

True Property: -1.1226690853760035
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the structures in the examples.

1. **Structural Analysis**: The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a phenol derivative with two methyl groups. This structure is similar to simple aromatic compounds with hydroxyl groups, like phenol (c1ccccc1O), which has a property value of -0.04326442.

2. **Substituent Effects**: The presence of methyl groups generally increases hydrophobicity and can affect electronic properties. In the examples, methyl groups in aromatic systems tend to have a small impact on the property value, often slightly increasing or decreasing it depending on the context.

3. **Comparison with Similar Molecules**: The molecule c1ccccc1O (phenol) has a property value of -0.04326442. The addition of methyl groups, as seen in other examples, often results in a slight decrease in the property value due to increased hydrophobicity and potential steric effects.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is likely to be slightly lower than that of phenol due to the additional methyl groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be around -0.1.

- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, 0.821786

These examples suggest that the presence of the phosphorothioate group contributes positively to the property value. Additionally, the molecule has a methoxy group (OC) and a thiomethyl group (SC) attached to the aromatic ring, which are not present in the examples but can be considered to have a neutral or slightly positive effect based on the overall structure.

Considering these factors and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be in the range of the examples with similar phosphorothioate groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 0.8.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we can observe that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have higher property values. For instance:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1.64461406.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1.77155333.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is similar in structure to these examples, with multiple chlorine atoms attached to an aromatic system. Given the trend observed, we can predict that the property value for this molecule will also be relatively high, likely in the same range as the examples provided.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be approximately 1.6.

True Property: 0.5344205368783032
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to the end. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with nitro groups and simple aliphatic chains.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with nitro groups tend to have property values around the range of -0.1 to 0.6, depending on the complexity and additional functional groups present. For instance, CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.62040896, and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.06399791.

Given the simplicity of CCCN(=O)=O compared to these examples, it is reasonable to predict a property value closer to the lower end of this range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be approximately -0.1.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -1.3988268872051055
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, which can be compared to similar structures in the examples.

From the examples, we have:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 with a property value of -0.2594673
- c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12 with a property value of 0.25399859
- Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl with a property value of 1.3305898

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but with a fluorine atom instead of a chlorine atom. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which could influence the property value. However, the presence of bromine, a heavier halogen, might also play a role in the property value.

Considering the examples and the potential influence of the electronegativity and size of the substituents, the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is likely to be close to that of Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but slightly more negative due to the presence of fluorine.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be approximately -0.3.

True Property: -1.964587709669982
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with an additional methyl group and a hydroxyl group. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with bicyclic or polycyclic frameworks and alcohol functionalities.

Looking at the examples, we see that molecules with alcohol groups, such as CCC(C)(C)O (0.29201915) and CCCCCCCCC(C)O (0.17478429), tend to have positive property values. Additionally, the presence of a bicyclic structure, as seen in some examples, can influence the property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is likely to be positive and in the range of the examples with similar features. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately 0.25.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -1.4323709366315613
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)
- An amide linkage (N2C(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)

Comparing this structure to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 0.45550747, we notice that both molecules share the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage with a phenyl ring. The main difference is the presence of a thioether (SC(CCl)) in the example, which is replaced by a direct connection to the amide in the target molecule.

Given the structural similarities and the absence of the thioether group, which might slightly affect the property, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is likely to be close to 0.45550747. However, due to the absence of the thioether, the value might be slightly lower.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is approximately 0.40.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzodiazepine-like structure, featuring a phenyl group attached to a diazepine ring with a carbonyl group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of -0.4024703. Both molecules contain aromatic rings and nitrogen atoms in a heterocyclic structure, but the example molecule has an additional aromatic ring and a more complex structure.

Given the structural similarities and the presence of aromatic and heterocyclic features, we can infer that the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C might be in a similar range, but likely slightly less negative due to its simpler structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be approximately -0.35.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -1.5906298723332992
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which is a linear chain with a total of 9 carbon atoms.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCC, a linear alkane with 5 carbons, has a property value of -1.98608135.
- CCCCCCCCI, a linear alkane with 8 carbons and an iodine atom, has a property value of 0.0680988.
- CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, a linear ester with 9 carbons, has a property value of -0.55548869.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar to CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, but with one less carbon in the chain. The presence of the ester functional group tends to increase the property value compared to simple alkanes, as seen in the examples.

Given these observations, the property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is likely to be slightly higher than that of CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC due to the shorter chain length, but still negative due to the overall structure. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around -0.5.

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.13474082305391352
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is methyl benzoate, which is an ester derived from benzoic acid.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Esters like CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) have a property value of -0.74771194.
2. Other aromatic esters, such as COC(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)Nc2cccc(C)c2)c1, have a property value of 0.39123448.

Given that methyl benzoate is structurally similar to ethyl benzoate but with a slightly smaller alkyl group, we can expect its property value to be close to that of ethyl benzoate. However, the presence of the methoxy group instead of an ethoxy group might slightly increase the property value due to the smaller size and potentially different electronic effects.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate) would be slightly higher than -0.74771194, but still negative. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.7.

True Property: -0.5263380146910369
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the overall molecular structure.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear conjugated diene, which is similar to the example C=Cc1ccccc1, which has a property value of -4.92435414. This suggests that conjugated systems, particularly those with multiple double bonds, tend to have more negative property values.

Considering the structure of C=CCC=C, which is a simple conjugated diene without additional functional groups or aromatic rings, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative, likely in the range of the more negative values observed in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C would be approximately -4.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular size and complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is a simple compound with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. This structure is similar to other halogenated compounds in the examples, such as FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br, which has a property value of -1.78959896. The presence of multiple halogen atoms, especially bromine, tends to increase the property value due to their electronegativity and size.

Considering the simplicity of BrC(Br)Br compared to more complex structures in the examples, and the fact that it is heavily halogenated, we can predict that its property value will be in the negative range, similar to other halogenated compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be approximately -1.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is present in the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 0.71908789.
- A thioester linkage (SC(CCl)), which is similar to the thioester linkage in the example CCN2c1ncccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23 with a property value of -2.21297821.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is present in several examples with varying property values.
- A bicyclic lactam structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O), which is similar to the structure in the example CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O with a property value of -1.20699655.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a positive contribution, while the thioester and chlorinated carbon may contribute negatively. The bicyclic lactam structure may also contribute negatively based on the examples.

Balancing these influences, the predicted property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is likely to be slightly positive, but not as high as the example with the phosphorothioate group alone.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A tertiary amide group (CN(C)C(=O)N), which is similar to the structure in CN(C)C(=O)C (0.83908483) and CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C (0.77564777).
- A chlorinated aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 (0.87479412) and Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (1.3305898).
- A nitro group (n2nc(oc2=O)), which is similar to the nitro groups in Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-2.45235544) and O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-0.17056974).
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C), which is similar to CCC(C)C (-1.26722538).

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of the tertiary amide and chlorinated aromatic ring suggests a positive contribution, while the nitro group and tert-butyl group might contribute negatively.

Balancing these influences, the predicted property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C is likely to be slightly positive, around 0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with chlorine atoms attached to each ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, which has a property value of 0.53676344. However, the example molecule has more chlorine atoms and no ether linkage.

The presence of the ether linkage in the target molecule might slightly alter the property value compared to the fully chlorinated phenyl ring. Additionally, the presence of three chlorine atoms in the target molecule suggests that the property value might be influenced by the electron-withdrawing nature of chlorine, similar to the example Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 0.87479412.

Considering these factors, the property value for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is likely to be positive and somewhat close to the values of the chlorinated aromatic compounds provided. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 0.6.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC/C=C\C, we can look at the example provided for a similar molecule, CC/C=C/C, which has a property value of -1.01496402. The only difference between the two molecules is the stereochemistry around the double bond, which is unlikely to have a significant impact on the property value in this context.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their corresponding property values.

The molecule CCCOCC is a linear chain with an ether functional group. Let's consider similar structures from the examples:

1. **CC(C)O**: This molecule has a property value of 0.69634631. It is a small alcohol with a branched structure.
2. **CCC(O)CC**: This molecule has a property value of 0.17467688. It is a linear alcohol with a similar chain length to CCCOCC.
3. **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**: This molecule has a property value of -0.74771194. It is an ester with an aromatic ring, which is quite different from CCCOCC.

The molecule CCCOCC is an ether, which is generally less polar than alcohols and esters. The property values for alcohols and esters in the examples vary, but ethers are not explicitly listed. However, given the linear structure and the presence of an ether group, the property value is likely to be closer to that of linear alcohols like CCC(O)CC.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be slightly positive, similar to CCC(O)CC, but potentially lower due to the ether group being less polar than the alcohol group.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCOCC could be approximately **0.1**.

The molecule in question is a tertiary amide with two phenyl rings and a tert-butyl group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 0.01471204. Both molecules contain an amide linkage and phenyl rings, but the example molecule has an additional heterocyclic component, which might slightly affect the property value.

Considering the structural similarities and the absence of strongly electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups that would significantly alter the property, the predicted property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be close to that of the example with a similar structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is approximately 0.01.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-), which is a common feature in several molecules with varying property values.
- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1), which is similar to the structure in Fc1cccc(Br)c1 with a property value of -1.39882689 and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 with a property value of -1.72101169.

Considering the presence of the bromobenzene moiety, which tends to have negative property values, and the acetamide group, which can have a stabilizing effect, the property value is likely to be negative but not as low as the bromobenzene examples due to the additional acetamide group.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around -1.2.

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6009015370260021
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples. This molecule is isobutylbenzene, which consists of an isobutyl group (CC(C)C) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1).

From the examples, we have:
- CC(C)CO (isobutanol) with a property value of 0.5577125
- CC(C)CCO (isopentanol) with a property value of 0.29201915
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (cumene) with a property value of -0.23843301
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethylbenzene) with a property value of -1.53261719

Isobutylbenzene is structurally similar to cumene (isopropylbenzene), but with an additional methylene group in the side chain. The property value for cumene is -0.23843301. The addition of a methylene group typically has a small effect on the property value, often making it slightly more negative due to increased hydrophobicity and molecular size.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 (isobutylbenzene) is likely to be slightly more negative than that of cumene. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of isobutylbenzene is approximately -0.3.

True Property: -0.16580861116309184
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have positive property values, while those with electron-donating groups or less polar groups tend to have negative or lower positive values. Benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which is moderately electron-withdrawing.

Comparing benzaldehyde to similar structures in the examples, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (0.64038984) and Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (0.05137674), we can infer that the presence of the carbonyl group in benzaldehyde will likely result in a property value that is positive but not as high as those with stronger electron-withdrawing groups like nitro.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) would be around 0.3.

- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, similar to the first example (Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2) which has a property value of 0.88941634.
- An oxazole ring (c1ccc(o1)), which is a heterocyclic aromatic compound.
- A cyclic urea moiety (O=C2CN...C(=O)N2), which is a common structural motif in pharmaceuticals.

The presence of the nitro group and the aromatic ring suggests that the property value might be positive, as seen in the first example. However, the cyclic urea and the oxazole ring might introduce some electron-withdrawing effects, potentially lowering the property value.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be around 0.5. This value reflects the balance between the electron-withdrawing effects and the aromatic character of the molecule.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.22908638306419438
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is a diarylamine, specifically a diphenylamine derivative, which is structurally similar to the example molecule N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 with a property value of 0.59401467.

The key difference between the two molecules is the presence of a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond in the example molecule, which is replaced by a nitrogen-nitrogen single bond in the target molecule. This change could slightly affect the electronic properties and steric factors, but the overall aromatic character and the presence of two phenyl rings remain consistent.

Given the structural similarity and considering the potential impact of the nitrogen-nitrogen bond difference, the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be close to that of the example molecule. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be approximately 0.59.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a bicyclic compound with two amide groups, similar to a diketopiperazine structure. In the examples, we have a few cyclic and bicyclic compounds with amide groups:

1. C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1, with a property value of 0.70151652.
2. O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, with a property value of 0.15911332.

Both of these examples have cyclic structures with amide groups, and their property values are positive, suggesting that the presence of amide groups in a cyclic structure tends to contribute positively to the property value.

Considering the structural similarity of the given molecule to these examples, particularly the diketopiperazine-like structure, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is positive and within the range of the examples provided.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 would be approximately 0.5.

True Property: 1.1279135881234439
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have negative property values. For instance, Clc1ccccc1Cl has a property value of -0.41660317, and Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a property value of 1.4693542, which is an exception due to its high degree of chlorination and specific structure.
- The presence of aromatic rings generally contributes to a more negative property value, especially when combined with electronegative substituents like chlorine.

Given these observations, the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, with its three chlorine atoms and biphenyl structure, is likely to have a negative property value. However, it is not as heavily chlorinated as the molecule with a positive property value, and it is more similar to Clc1ccccc1Cl.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around -0.5, considering the influence of the chlorine atoms and the biphenyl structure.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.7485238569551214
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is an alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically a diethylbenzene. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Aromatic compounds with simple alkyl substitutions, such as Cc1ccccc1N (-0.26568449) and Cc1ccccn1 (-0.35956281), tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of additional functional groups, such as carbonyls or nitro groups, often results in more negative values, but this molecule lacks such groups.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a relatively simple aromatic compound with alkyl groups, it is reasonable to predict a property value similar to other simple alkyl-substituted aromatics. 

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be around -0.3.

To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is a sulfonamide derivative, which contains a benzene ring (phenyl group) attached to a sulfonamide group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a nitro group attached to a benzene ring and has a property value of 0.16617708.

The sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is electron-withdrawing, similar to the nitro group (N(=O)=O), but it is generally less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group. This could suggest a slightly lower property value compared to the nitro-substituted benzene.

Considering these structural similarities and differences, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be slightly lower than 0.16617708. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.1.

These molecules have high property values, likely due to their extended conjugated systems and aromaticity.

Based on this comparison, the predicted property value for c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 is likely to be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 1.2.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the structures in the examples, particularly those with aromatic rings and multiple hydroxyl groups, which tend to have positive property values.

For instance, the molecule Oc1cccc(O)c1 has a property value of 0.23359206, and it contains a single aromatic ring with two hydroxyl groups. The given molecule has a more complex structure with additional aromatic rings and functional groups, which could increase the property value.

Considering these factors and the trend observed in the examples, I would predict a positive property value for the given molecule. A reasonable estimate, based on the complexity and functional groups, would be around 0.5. Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 is approximately 0.5.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, symmetrical molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, tend to have positive property values. This suggests that the presence of chlorine atoms contributes positively to the property value.

Considering the examples and the structure of Cl\C=C/Cl, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value, but not as high as those with more complex aromatic systems or additional functional groups. A reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around 0.5.

- Molecules with amide linkages, such as O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, have property values around 0.00702861.
- Chlorinated aromatic rings, such as Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, have higher property values, like 1.49962534.
- The presence of a pyridine-like structure, as seen in c1ccc2cnccc2c1, results in a property value of -2.30964014.

Considering these observations, the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 has a combination of features that could lead to a moderate property value. The ester and amide linkages suggest a value close to zero, while the chlorinated aromatic ring and pyridine-like structure could increase or decrease the value, respectively.

Balancing these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be slightly negative, but not as low as the pyridine example. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of molecular structures with different functional groups and chain lengths, and their property values range from negative to positive.

The molecule CCCCCO is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a terminal hydroxyl group, making it a primary alcohol (1-pentanol). In the examples, linear alkanes and simple alcohols tend to have property values around zero or slightly negative. For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCCI (a linear alkane with an iodine atom) has a property value of 0.0680988, and OC1CCCCCCC1 (a cyclic alcohol) has a property value of -1.41825219.

Considering the structure of CCCCCO and its similarity to simple alkanes and alcohols, we can predict that its property value will be slightly negative, reflecting the presence of the hydroxyl group and the linear carbon chain.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a sulfonamide with a cyclic structure, which includes a benzene ring and a sulfonyl group. The presence of the sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) and the amide linkage (C(=O)N) are significant features that can influence the property value.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with sulfonyl groups and aromatic rings tend to have property values around the range of -0.5 to 0.5. For instance, the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.05606613, and it contains a sulfonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is likely to be around -0.1 to 0.1. Given the structural complexity and the presence of both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, a reasonable prediction would be:

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:

1. **Aromatic Ring**: The presence of an aromatic ring (c2ccccc2) is a common feature in many of the examples, often associated with negative property values.
2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The presence of a nitro group is also seen in some examples, such as CCCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, which has a positive property value.
3. **Ester Groups (C(=O)OC)**: The molecule has ester groups, which are present in some examples with both positive and negative property values.
4. **Heterocyclic Ring with Nitrogen**: The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring can influence the property value, as seen in some examples.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule has a mix of features that could lead to either a positive or negative property value. However, the presence of the nitro group and the aromatic ring, which are often associated with negative values, might dominate.

Based on the structural analysis and comparison with the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be slightly negative. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two carbonyl groups (C=O) and two nitrogen atoms in a six-membered ring. This structure is relatively small and lacks significant functional groups that would contribute to a high positive or negative property value, such as extensive aromatic systems or highly electronegative atoms like multiple halogens.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar small cyclic structures and carbonyl groups, such as CCC(C)C(=O)OC2CC(C)C=C3C=CC(C)C(CCC1CC(O)CC(=O)O1)C23 (0.64674297) and CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C (0.95088776), tend to have property values around 0.5 to 1.0. However, these examples also have additional structural complexity and functional groups that could increase their property values.

Given the simplicity and lack of additional functional groups in O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, it is reasonable to predict a property value closer to zero, but slightly negative due to the presence of carbonyl groups, which can contribute to a more negative value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule ClCC is a simple chloroalkane, specifically chloroethane. In the examples, molecules with chlorine atoms tend to have negative property values, especially when the chlorine is attached to an aromatic ring or when multiple chlorines are present. However, in simpler aliphatic structures, the effect might be less pronounced.

Given the simplicity of ClCC compared to the more complex structures in the examples, and considering the trend of negative values for chlorinated compounds, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be slightly negative.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCC is approximately -0.5.

1. Chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values, as seen in Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2 (0.53749772) and Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (1.4693542).
2. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (1.12791359).
3. The presence of a pyridine ring, as in Clc1cccc(n1), might slightly reduce the property value compared to a benzene ring, but the effect is not very pronounced.

Considering these points, the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is expected to have a positive property value, likely in the range of 0.5 to 1.5. Given the examples and the structural features, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 1.2.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCC(O)CCC, which is a similar alcohol with a longer carbon chain, has a property value of -0.94731798.
- CCC(C)CCO, another alcohol with a similar structure but shorter chain, has a property value of -0.06808492.
- CCC(CC)CO, which is structurally similar to CCC(C)CCO, also has a property value of -0.06808492.

Given that CCCCC(C)O is structurally between CCC(C)CCO and CCCCC(O)CCC, we can predict that its property value will be closer to that of CCC(C)CCO, but slightly more negative due to the longer carbon chain.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCC(C)O would be around -0.1.

   - ClCCl (dichloromethane) has a property value of -0.07541613.
   - ClC(Cl)Cl (chloroform) has a property value of -1.0546086.
   - ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl (carbon tetrachloride) has a property value of -1.3762638.
   - ClC(=C)Cl (1,1-dichloroethylene) has a property value of -0.91561186.

2. The presence of multiple halogen atoms generally results in more negative property values.

3. Aromatic compounds with halogen substituents, such as Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.34985704.

Considering these observations, 1,4-dibromobenzene is expected to have a negative property value due to the presence of two bromine atoms on an aromatic ring. The property value is likely to be more negative than that of simple halogenated alkanes but less negative than highly halogenated compounds like carbon tetrachloride.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 (1,4-dibromobenzene) would be approximately -0.5.

Considering the pattern from the examples, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value. However, since the given molecule has fewer chlorine atoms than the example, we can expect the property value to be slightly lower than 2.07852304.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be around 1.5.

- Aromatic rings (phenyl groups)
- Phosphate ester linkage

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with ester or phosphate groups also tend to have positive property values, as seen in examples like CCOC=O (0.7997293) and CCOC(=O)CC (0.34159334).

Given these observations, the presence of multiple aromatic rings and the phosphate ester group in the molecule suggests a positive property value. The structural similarity to other aromatic ester compounds in the examples supports this.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Fluorinated Aromatic Ring**: The presence of a trifluoromethyl group (CF3) attached to an aromatic ring is a significant feature. In the examples, molecules with multiple halogens or electron-withdrawing groups like CF3 tend to have higher property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a high property value of 1.77155333.

2. **Chlorinated Cyclohexanone**: The molecule also contains a chlorinated cyclohexanone moiety. Chlorine atoms and carbonyl groups can influence the property value. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2, have a property value of 1.31978548.

3. **Overall Structure**: The combination of a trifluoromethyl group, chlorinated cyclohexanone, and an aromatic ring suggests a relatively high property value due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents and the potential for increased molecular interactions.

Considering these factors and comparing with the examples, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O is likely to be positive and relatively high. A reasonable estimate would be around 1.2.

To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitrobenzene derivative with a methoxy group attached to the benzene ring. 

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have a negative impact on the property value, as seen in O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O with a property value of -0.17056974.
- Methoxy groups (OCH3) can have varying effects, but in the example of COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC, the property value is 0.09058966, which is slightly positive.
- The presence of a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) tends to have a small negative or near-zero impact, as seen in c1ccccc1O with a property value of -0.04326442.

Considering these observations, the methoxy group might slightly increase the property value, while the nitro group will likely decrease it. The overall effect of the benzene ring is relatively neutral. Therefore, the property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is expected to be slightly negative, but not as negative as molecules with multiple nitro groups or other strongly negative substituents.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is approximately -0.1.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. This molecule is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to hexachlorocyclohexane derivatives.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, especially those that are cyclic or polycyclic, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl has a property value of 0.28743721. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value due to their electron-withdrawing nature and the impact on molecular stability and reactivity.

Given the high degree of chlorination and the structural complexity of the molecule in question, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. Considering the examples and the structural similarities, a predicted property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl would likely be around 0.3 to 0.5.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately 0.4.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.5961404749810381
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with carbonyl groups (C=O) often have negative property values, such as CC(O)c1ccccc1 (-0.51153642) and CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O (1.1998999).
- Simple aliphatic chains, like CCC#C (0.28827837) and CCCCC#C (-0.63855681), have property values that are closer to zero, but can be either slightly positive or negative.
- The presence of an ester group (COC=O) in the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 (-0.1025277) suggests a slightly negative property value.

Considering these observations, CCCOC=O is a relatively simple ester with a short aliphatic chain. Based on the examples and trends, I would predict a slightly negative property value for CCCOC=O, likely around -0.1 to -0.2.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC=O is approximately -0.15.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is a long-chain ester, specifically decanoate ester. It has a long hydrophobic alkyl chain (10 carbon atoms) and an ester functional group. In the examples, molecules with long alkyl chains and ester groups tend to have property values that are slightly positive or close to zero, indicating a balance between hydrophobic and polar characteristics.

For instance, the molecule CCCCOC has a property value of 0.27791998, and it is a smaller ester. The molecule CC, which is a simple alkane, has a property value of 0.29092951. These examples suggest that the presence of an ester group and a long alkyl chain might result in a property value that is slightly positive.

Considering these observations, I would predict that the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is likely to be slightly positive, around 0.3 to 0.4. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately:

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to the aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with phenol groups, such as Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1, also tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of chlorine atoms in aromatic rings, as seen in several examples, does not significantly alter the trend towards negative values.

Considering these observations, the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O is likely to have a negative property value. Given the structural similarities to the example Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of -2.45235544, and considering the additional phenol group, a reasonable prediction would be a slightly more negative value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O is approximately -2.5.

Additionally, the molecule has aromatic rings and ether linkages, which are common in several examples with positive property values.

Considering these structural similarities and the presence of multiple phosphorothioate groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for this molecule will be positive and likely in a similar range to the example with a phosphorothioate group.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol. It contains a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to the benzene ring. 

From the examples, we can identify some relevant patterns:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, have negative property values. The example Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.8375071.
- Molecules with phenol groups, such as Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, also have negative property values. The example Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 has a property value of -1.12266909.

Given that Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has both a nitro group and a phenol group, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative. Considering the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be around -0.9, as it combines the effects of both functional groups.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.9.

True Property: 2.356164620242675
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a complex sugar-like structure with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, resembling polysaccharides or oligosaccharides.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, such as sugars, tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, which is a sugar-like structure, has a property value of 1.64116951.

Given the complexity and the number of hydroxyl groups in the molecule OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar or slightly higher due to the increased number of hydroxyl groups and the overall complexity.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be approximately 1.7.

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne. It has a terminal alkyne group (C#C) and a relatively small carbon chain. In the examples, molecules with small carbon chains and unsaturated bonds (like triple bonds) tend to have property values around the range of small negative values.

For instance, the molecule N#Cc1ccccc1C#N, which contains triple bonds, has a property value of -0.08489103. Similarly, CCC(C)C(=O)C, which is a small molecule with a carbonyl group, has a property value of -0.32695922.

Considering these observations, the property value for CCC#C is likely to be a small negative value. Based on the trends in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be approximately -0.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 0.71908789.
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl with a property value of 0.28931086 and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of 1.64461406.

Considering these structural similarities, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring tends to increase the property value, as seen in the examples. The phosphorothioate group also contributes positively, as seen in the example with a similar group.

Taking these factors into account, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be positive and somewhat close to the values of similar structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.8.

True Property: 1.0102845974112975
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 contains a pyridine ring (c1nccc1) with a carbonyl group (C=O) and a hydrazine moiety (NN) attached to it. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2, which has a property value of 1.17251661. Both molecules contain nitrogen heterocycles and carbonyl groups, which can contribute to similar electronic properties.

However, the presence of the hydrazine group (NN) in c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 might influence the property value differently compared to the example with the imidazole ring. The hydrazine group can introduce additional electron-donating effects, potentially altering the overall property value.

Considering these factors and the range of property values in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be around 0.8. This value accounts for the electronic effects of the pyridine ring, carbonyl group, and hydrazine moiety, while being slightly lower than the example with the imidazole ring due to the different electronic contributions of the hydrazine group.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Functional Groups and Structural Features**:
   - The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1 with a property value of -0.77489419.
   - It has an amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is present in several molecules with varying property values, such as CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1 (-0.06783803) and CCN2c1cc(N(C)C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23 (-0.16125981).
   - The molecule also contains a piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1), which is a saturated heterocyclic amine. This feature is not directly present in the examples, but similar cyclic structures like C/C1CCC(\C)CC1 (-0.70382971) can provide some insight.

2. **Overall Molecular Structure**:
   - The molecule is relatively large and complex, with multiple functional groups that can influence the property value.
   - The presence of both polar (amide, phosphorothioate) and non-polar (alkyl chains) groups suggests a balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions.

3. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - The molecule's complexity and the presence of a phosphorothioate group suggest a property value that might be slightly negative, similar to other complex molecules with polar functional groups.
   - Considering the examples with similar functional groups and structural complexity, a property value in the range of -0.5 to -0.8 seems reasonable.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be approximately:

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.04359139073475705
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (n-octane), we can analyze the trends in the provided examples. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of functional groups, aromatic rings, and the overall size of the molecule.

In the examples, linear alkanes and simple alcohols tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCCCCCCO (1-octanol) has a property value of -0.95151566, and CCCCCC/C=C/C (1-octene) has a property value of -0.88357311. These values are negative, likely due to the non-polar nature and lack of functional groups that significantly alter the property.

Given that CCCCCCCC (n-octane) is a simple, linear alkane without any functional groups, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and similar to those of other linear alkanes or simple hydrocarbons in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (n-octane) is approximately -0.9.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbonyl group (C=O), as well as an alkyne (C#C). The presence of these functional groups and the overall complexity of the structure can influence the property value.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with multiple rings and carbonyl groups, such as CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, have property values around 0.45617008.
- The presence of a hydroxyl group in a polycyclic structure, as seen in CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO, results in a property value of -0.81997712.
- The presence of an alkyne group (C#C) is not directly represented in the examples, but it can be considered to have a neutral to slightly negative effect on the property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative due to the combination of the hydroxyl group, carbonyl group, and the alkyne. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.5.

Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples. The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as aromatic and heterocyclic components.

From the examples provided, it seems that the property values are influenced by the presence of aromatic rings, heteroatoms (such as oxygen, nitrogen, and halogens), and functional groups like carbonyls, nitro groups, and ethers. The presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups and aromatic rings in the molecule suggests a potential for a higher property value, similar to other complex polycyclic structures in the examples.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen atoms, which often contribute to higher property values in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 1.2. This is based on the trend observed in the examples where complex structures with multiple functional groups and aromatic systems tend to have higher property values.

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of specific functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to some of the examples provided. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccccc1I has a property value of -0.49556078, and Fc1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.66979668. Both of these molecules are halogenated benzenes, similar to Oc1ccccc1Cl.

Additionally, the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, which is a nitrophenol, has a property value of 0.05137674. This suggests that the presence of a hydroxyl group on a benzene ring can have a positive influence on the property value.

Considering these observations, the presence of both a hydroxyl group and a chlorine atom on the benzene ring in Oc1ccccc1Cl suggests that the property value might be slightly negative, similar to other halogenated phenols. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around -0.5.

The molecule contains:
- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C), which is a relatively small and polarizable group.
- An ester linkage (OC(=O)), which is polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.
- An amide group (NC(=O)), which is also polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1), which is similar to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, especially on aromatic rings, tend to have higher property values (e.g., Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl with 1.77155333).
- Molecules with polar functional groups like amides and esters can have a range of property values, but they often contribute to a moderate increase in the property value compared to hydrocarbons.

Considering these factors, the presence of the chloroalkyne, ester, and amide groups, along with the chlorinated aromatic ring, suggests that the property value will be positive and likely moderate, but not as high as those with multiple chlorines on aromatic rings.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around 0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A central carbon atom bonded to an -OH group and three aromatic rings.
- Two of these rings are chlorinated phenyl rings, and one is a pyrimidine ring.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings, especially those with halogen substitutions, tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles (like pyrimidine) can also influence the property value, often increasing it.
- The presence of multiple chlorine atoms in aromatic systems tends to increase the property value.

Given these observations, the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl has features that suggest a relatively high property value due to the presence of multiple aromatic rings, chlorine substitutions, and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 1.2.

The presence of the ester functional group (OC=O) in CCCCCOC=O is similar to the ketone group (=O) in CCCCCCC=O, and both have a similar alkyl chain length. The ester group might slightly alter the property value compared to the ketone, but given the similarity in structure and the examples provided, we can expect the property value to be in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be approximately -0.55.

The molecule ClCCl is a simpler structure, being dichloromethane, compared to ClCCCl, which is 1,2-dichloroethane. Given the trend that smaller and simpler molecules tend to have slightly less negative or more positive property values, we can predict that ClCCl will have a property value slightly less negative than ClCCCl.

True Property: -1.1226690853760035
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a methylphenol, specifically p-cresol, which is a phenol derivative with a methyl group attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that phenol derivatives tend to have property values around the range of -0.7 to 0.2. For instance, Oc1cccc(O)c1 has a property value of 0.23359206, and CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O has a property value of -0.72168322. The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) in phenols generally contributes to a more positive property value compared to hydrocarbons without such polar functional groups.

Considering the structure of Cc1cccc(C)c1O, which is similar to phenol but with an additional methyl group, the property value is likely to be slightly more positive than that of a simple phenol due to the electron-donating effect of the methyl group, which can increase the electron density on the aromatic ring.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be around -0.5. However, given the specific examples and the influence of the methyl group, a more precise prediction would be:

- Simple hydrocarbons with linear or branched chains, such as CCCCCCCC (0.04359139) and CCCCCCCCCC=C (0.4847784), tend to have property values around 0.0 to 0.5.
- Molecules with more complex structures or additional functional groups tend to have more extreme property values, either positive or negative.

Given that isoprene is a relatively simple hydrocarbon with a branched structure, it is likely to have a property value similar to other simple hydrocarbons. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around 0.1 to 0.5.

Therefore, I would predict the property value for CC=C(C)C to be approximately 0.2.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.07541612524712053
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane), we can analyze the trends in the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have positive property values, especially when the chlorine atoms are part of larger, more complex structures. However, smaller molecules with chlorine, such as Oc1cccc(Cl)c1, have negative property values.

Given that ClCCl is a small molecule with two chlorine atoms, it is likely to have a negative property value, similar to other small chlorinated compounds in the examples.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value for ClCCl to be approximately -1.0.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.029203489184442787
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the data. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, similar to the example Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a property value of 0.02920349.

The structure of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is very similar to the example, with the only difference being the position of the chlorine atoms. Given the similarity in structure, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be close to that of the example.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is approximately 0.02920349.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.013054140792928923
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known molecules.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether linkages, aromatic rings, and oxygen-containing functional groups. The presence of methoxy groups (OC) and hydroxyl groups (O) suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and increased polarity. The polycyclic nature and the presence of multiple oxygen atoms could contribute to a higher property value, similar to other complex structures with multiple rings and oxygen atoms in the examples.

Given the examples, molecules with high oxygen content and complex ring systems tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule OCC(O)CO has a property value of 1.43124154, and OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O has a property value of 2.10320098. These examples suggest that the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages can significantly increase the property value.

Considering these factors, I would predict that the property value for the given molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 is likely to be relatively high, possibly around 1.5 to 2.0. However, without precise computational tools or empirical data, this prediction is an estimation based on structural analysis and comparison with the provided examples.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.7044814712288847
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of a sulfur atom and a tert-butyl group can influence the property value. 

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar heterocyclic structures and functional groups, such as CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C, have a property value of 0.29124095. This molecule also contains a sulfur atom and a tert-butyl group, which are similar features to the molecule in question.

Considering these similarities, the predicted property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is likely to be close to 0.29124095. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is approximately:

0.29

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.7477119363392154
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is an ester, specifically ethyl benzoate, which consists of a benzene ring attached to an ester functional group.

Looking at the examples, we have:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 with a property value of 0.17091766. This molecule is more complex due to additional functional groups, but it shares the ester linkage and benzene ring.

2. CCCCCC(=O)OCC with a property value of -0.51119474. This is a simple ester with a longer alkyl chain but lacks the aromatic ring.

3. CCCCC(=O)OCC also with a property value of -0.51119474. This is another simple ester with a similar structure to the previous example.

4. Cc1cccc2c1Cc3ccccc32 with a property value of 0.2244435. This molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, which shares the aromatic character but lacks the ester group.

Given these comparisons, the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is expected to have a property value influenced by both the ester group and the aromatic ring. The presence of the aromatic ring might increase the property value compared to simple esters, but it is less complex than the first example with additional functional groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be slightly higher than the simple esters but lower than the more complex aromatic compounds. A predicted value could be around -0.3.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.028498883904885614
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the length of carbon chains, and the presence of halogens.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached. In the examples, we have:

- CCCCCCCCO, which has a property value of -0.95151566. This molecule is similar to CCCCCCCBr, but with an oxygen atom instead of bromine.
- Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which has a property value of 0.25399859. This molecule contains a bromine atom in an aromatic ring, which is different from the linear alkyl chain in CCCCCCCBr.

Considering the linear alkyl chain nature of CCCCCCCBr and the presence of a bromine atom, we can expect the property value to be somewhat similar to CCCCCCCCO, but potentially slightly higher due to the presence of bromine, which is more electronegative than oxygen and can influence the property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be slightly higher than -0.95151566. A predicted value could be around -0.8.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.039357704477799
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide), we need to consider the nature of the molecule and compare it to the examples provided. Carbon monoxide is a small, simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is non-polar and has a relatively low molecular weight.

Looking at the examples, smaller and simpler molecules like CCC (propane) and CC#C (propyne) have property values around -0.06963563 and 0.55482989, respectively. These values suggest that small hydrocarbons and simple molecules tend to have property values close to zero, with slight variations depending on their specific structure and functional groups.

Given that CO is a small, non-polar molecule with a triple bond, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would be close to zero, similar to the small hydrocarbons. However, due to the presence of the polar C≡O bond, it might be slightly more positive than a simple hydrocarbon like propane.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO would be around 0.1.
