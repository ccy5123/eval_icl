SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.7551473960638355
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The molecule is a long-chain ester, specifically a decanoate ester. 

From the examples, we observe that:
- Long-chain hydrocarbons and esters tend to have positive property values.
- The property value seems to increase with the length of the carbon chain in esters.

For instance:
- CCCCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of 1.81193603.
- CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which is one carbon longer, is expected to have a slightly higher property value.

Given that CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is one carbon longer than CCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can predict that its property value will be slightly higher than 1.81193603. 

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is approximately 2.0.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.3791152644729596
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a fused heterocyclic structure, specifically a chlorinated benzoxazole. The presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in several examples. The heterocyclic structure with an oxygen and nitrogen atom can also influence the property value, often leading to a moderate increase or decrease depending on the specific arrangement and additional substituents.

Comparing with similar structures:
- The molecule Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 0.16646894, which is a chlorinated aromatic compound.
- The molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 has a property value of -0.49122827, which is a simpler chlorinated aromatic compound.

Considering the additional heterocyclic structure in Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, which may slightly increase the property value compared to simpler chlorinated aromatics, I would predict a property value slightly above the average of the simpler chlorinated aromatics.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be approximately 0.1.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.820211913946483
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O). The presence of the nitro group is significant because it is an electron-withdrawing group, which generally contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in some of the examples with nitro groups or other electron-withdrawing groups.

Looking at the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have negative property values.
- Simple hydrocarbons or those with electron-donating groups tend to have less negative or positive values.

Given the presence of the nitro group and the relatively simple structure of the isopropyl group, the property value is likely to be negative, but not as negative as some of the more complex or highly substituted nitro compounds.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O would be around -0.5.

CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO

This molecule appears to be a polycyclic compound with multiple rings and carbonyl groups, similar to some of the more complex structures in the examples. Notably, it resembles the structure of steroids or terpenes, which are often associated with higher property values due to their complexity and the presence of multiple rings and functional groups.

Looking at the examples, the molecules with high property values (e.g., 10.70049755 and 10.19029481) are also complex polycyclic structures with multiple rings and carbonyl groups. Given the structural similarity, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for this molecule will also be relatively high.

Therefore, based on the structural complexity and comparison with similar examples, I would predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:

- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N), which is a common feature in several molecules with negative property values.
- A chlorobenzene moiety (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), which is similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of -0.53553963.

Considering these structural components and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of electron-withdrawing groups like fluorine and chlorine, and the amide linkage, the property value is likely to be negative.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be approximately -0.55.

True Property: -0.5564173707858278
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with a linear chain and a branching methyl group. It is similar in structure to other small aliphatic ethers and alcohols in the examples, such as CCCCCCO (-0.65665073) and CCCCCC(O)CC (-0.13841648). These molecules have negative property values, likely due to their relatively simple and non-polar nature.

Given the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that CCCOC(C)C will also have a negative property value, but slightly less negative than CCCCCCO due to the presence of the ether group, which can slightly increase the property value compared to a simple alkane.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C would be around -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a substituted pyrrole with two carbonyl groups and a bromine atom. The presence of carbonyl groups typically contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in several examples. The bromine atom can also influence the property, but its effect is less pronounced compared to carbonyl groups.

Looking at the examples, molecules with carbonyl groups and halogens, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.12958668) and Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (-0.53553963), tend to have negative property values. The presence of an alkyl chain (CCC(C)) might slightly increase the property value, but not significantly.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O is likely to be slightly negative, similar to the examples with carbonyl and halogen groups.

Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately -0.2.

True Property: -0.09866057817518414
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a physicochemical property such as hydrophobicity or a related measure.

Biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic compound consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples, aromatic compounds with multiple rings tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67, which is a highly fused polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a high property value of 6.14030235. On the other hand, simpler aromatic compounds like Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O have lower values, such as 0.09096644.

Given that biphenyl is less complex than the highly fused aromatic hydrocarbons but more complex than simple benzene derivatives, its property value is likely to be moderate. The molecule Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34, which is naphthalene, has a property value of 1.88298841. Biphenyl, being similar in complexity to naphthalene, might have a similar property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around 1.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, ring structures, and overall molecular size.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a sulfur atom at the end. This structure is similar to linear alkanes, which generally have negative property values in the examples provided. For instance, CCCCCCC=C has a property value of -0.12185715, and CCCCCCC(C)O has a property value of 0.10321747. The presence of sulfur, which is less common in the examples, might slightly alter the property value compared to a simple alkane.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCCCS is likely to be slightly negative, similar to other linear alkanes. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS is approximately -0.1.

True Property: -0.44607158917844475
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with a tertiary carbon attached to an alcohol group. This structure is similar to the example CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O, which has a property value of 0.31292979. Both molecules contain a tertiary alcohol group, but CCCC(C)(C)CO is a simpler structure with fewer rings and less steric hindrance.

Considering the examples, simpler alcohols and alkanes tend to have negative property values, such as CCC(C)(C)C with -0.64703192 and CCCC(C)(C)C with -0.17220643. The presence of the alcohol group in CCCC(C)(C)CO might increase the property value slightly compared to a simple alkane.

Taking these observations into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO would be slightly positive, but closer to zero due to its simplicity and lack of complex functional groups.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is approximately 0.1.

The structure of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is a naphthalene ring system, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. In the examples, similar aromatic systems tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative. Given the similarity to the example Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, we can predict that the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 will be close to that of the example.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately -0.01.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic urea, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -0.23212192. The main difference in the new molecule is the presence of a longer alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) attached to the cyclic urea structure.

Longer alkyl chains generally increase hydrophobicity, which can affect the property value. However, the examples suggest that the property values for similar structures are relatively low and close to zero, often negative, especially for cyclic urea derivatives.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is likely to be slightly more negative than -0.23212192 due to the increased hydrophobicity from the longer alkyl chain. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately:

To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have negative property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of -0.28558223, and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of -0.51321898. These examples suggest that the presence of halogens on an aromatic ring generally results in a negative property value.

Considering the electronegative nature of the trifluoromethyl group and its effect on the aromatic ring, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 will also be negative. Given the examples and the structural similarity, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around -0.3 to -0.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.4.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a property value of -0.35480017. This suggests that the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups tends to result in a negative property value, likely due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding potential.

Given the structural similarity of OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O to the example with a similar polyol structure, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will also be negative and close to the example provided.

Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately -0.35480017.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. It resembles some of the larger, more complex molecules in the examples, such as CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of 14.88020125.

Given the structural complexity and the presence of multiple rings and functional groups, the property value is likely to be relatively high. The presence of additional oxygen-containing functional groups (like the ester) might slightly lower the value compared to the example with a similar structure but without the ester.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 13.5.

It resembles some of the more complex structures in the examples, such as CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 5.06853283. This suggests that the presence of multiple rings and a hydroxyl group can contribute to a higher property value.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of functional groups, the predicted property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O is likely to be in a similar range to the example with a similar structure. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 5.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an acetanilide derivative with a nitro group attached to the aromatic ring. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to contribute negatively to the property value, as seen in molecules like O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (-0.66272979) and COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (-0.51273736).
- The presence of an amide group (C(=O)N) can also influence the property, as seen in molecules like CNC(=O)C=C(C)OP(=O)(OC)OC (0.64427092) and CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1 (1.02709307).

Considering these factors, the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is likely to have a property value that is negative due to the influence of the nitro group, but not as negative as some of the simpler nitrobenzene derivatives due to the presence of the amide group.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O would be around -0.5.

- An aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent, similar to some of the chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.
- A heterocyclic structure with a carbonyl group, similar to some of the heterocyclic compounds in the examples.

Based on the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have property values around -0.3 to 0.5. The presence of additional functional groups like carbonyls and heterocycles can increase the property value, as seen in some examples with similar features.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be around 0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)(C)CO is a simple alcohol, specifically tert-butanol. It has a tertiary carbon attached to a hydroxyl group. In the examples, we have several alcohols and hydrocarbons with varying chain lengths and branching, such as:

- CCC (propane), with a property value of -0.88323941
- CC(C)CO (isobutanol), with a property value of -0.80090966
- CCCCCCCC(C)O (nonanol), with a property value of 0.10321747

The property values for alcohols tend to be slightly higher than those for alkanes of similar size, likely due to the presence of the hydroxyl group, which can introduce polarity and hydrogen bonding.

Given that tert-butanol (CC(C)(C)CO) is similar in size to isobutanol (CC(C)CO) but with more branching, we can expect its property value to be close to that of isobutanol. The branching might slightly increase the property value due to increased steric effects and potential changes in solubility or other interactions.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO would be slightly higher than that of isobutanol, which is -0.80090966. A predicted value could be around -0.75, considering the effect of increased branching.

These examples suggest that nitrogen heterocycles, especially those with carbonyl groups, often have negative property values.

Given the structure of O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12, which is a bicyclic nitrogen heterocycle with carbonyl groups, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Based on the examples, a value around -0.7 to -0.8 seems plausible.

For instance, CC(C)O (isopropanol) has a property value of -0.88345001, and CCC(C)C (isopentane) has a property value of -0.64703192. Esters like CCC(C)C(=O)C (isopropyl acetate) have a property value of -0.61373905.

Given that CC(C)OC=O is a small ester, similar to the examples with negative values, we can predict that its property value will also be negative. Considering the trend and the size of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around -0.7.

For instance, NC(=O)c1cccnc1 has a property value of -0.66177344, and Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.62775889. These examples suggest that the presence of aromatic rings and carbonyl groups contribute to a negative property value.

Given the structure of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, which is similar in terms of functional groups and aromaticity to the examples with negative values, we can predict that the property value will also be negative.

From the examples, we observe that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 (a larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon), have a property value of 1.60790108. Smaller aromatic compounds, like benzene derivatives, tend to have negative or small positive property values.

Given that triphenylene is a smaller polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compared to the example with a property value of 1.60790108, we can expect its property value to be somewhat lower but still positive due to its aromatic nature and structural similarity.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (triphenylene) would be around 1.0.

- CCN(CC)c1nc(Cl)nc(n1)N(CC)CC has a property value of 1.90656222.

Considering the presence of the sulfonamide and guanidine groups, which are polar and can contribute to a higher property value, the predicted property value for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is likely to be in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is approximately 1.5.

- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) attached to the aromatic ring, which can also contribute to a negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
- An alkylamine group (CCN(CC(C)=C)), which can contribute to a positive property value, as seen in examples like CCN(CC)c1ccccc1 (-0.04364086).

Considering these factors, the presence of two nitro groups and a trifluoromethyl group suggests a strong electron-withdrawing effect, which would likely result in a negative property value. The alkylamine group may offset this to some extent, but the overall effect is expected to be negative.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around -0.5.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.8042836084713485
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, an ester. Esters in the examples tend to have negative property values, often around -0.2 to -0.6. For instance, CCC(C)(C)O has a property value of -0.71480085, and CC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of -0.57498192. These examples suggest that the presence of an ester group contributes to a negative property value.

Considering the structure of isopropyl formate, which is a relatively simple ester, and comparing it to similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be around -0.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O is approximately -0.5.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.535417881009983
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the other aromatic compounds in the list.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is structurally similar to c1ccccc1O (phenol), which has a property value of -0.74840423. The presence of additional methyl groups in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 could slightly alter the property value, but given the examples, the effect of methyl groups on aromatic rings tends to be relatively small.

Considering the examples and the structural similarity to phenol, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be slightly less negative than that of phenol due to the electron-donating effect of the methyl groups. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.6.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 5.889114067377353
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is present in several examples with relatively high property values, such as:

- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl: 5.02840833
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl: 5.83265494
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl: 4.01979966

These examples suggest that the presence of the phosphorothioate group contributes significantly to the property value. Additionally, the molecule has a methoxy group (OC) and a thiomethyl group (SC) attached to the aromatic ring, which are not present in the examples with the highest values but are similar to the structure of the examples with moderate values.

Considering these structural similarities and the influence of the phosphorothioate group, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be in the range of 4 to 6. Given the specific structure and the presence of the thiomethyl group, a reasonable prediction would be:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a chlorinated biphenyl, similar to some of the examples given. Specifically, it resembles the structure Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 2.67890972. The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has fewer chlorine atoms than the example, which might suggest a slightly lower property value due to reduced electron-withdrawing effects and possibly lower molecular weight.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be slightly lower than 2.67890972. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 2.5.

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7990917444403222
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group attached to the terminal carbon. The presence of the nitro group (N(=O)=O) is a significant factor, as it is an electron-withdrawing group that can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have positive property values, especially when they are attached to aromatic systems or when there are multiple nitro groups. However, in this case, the nitro group is attached to a simple aliphatic chain, which might not have as strong an effect as in aromatic systems.

For example, the molecule CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a property value of 2.60064465, but it has multiple nitro groups and additional electron-withdrawing groups, which likely contribute to the higher value.

Considering the simpler structure of CCCN(=O)=O, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly positive but not as high as those with more complex structures or multiple nitro groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 0.1.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.5240828504208642
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's consider the examples with similar structures:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1: -0.39647216
- c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12: 0.01764665
- Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl: 1.35361886

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is structurally similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, which has a property value of -0.39647216. The presence of a fluorine atom, which is more electronegative than chlorine, might slightly affect the property value. However, given the examples, the property values for halogenated benzenes tend to be negative or slightly positive.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be slightly negative, similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1. Therefore, a predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 could be approximately -0.35.

True Property: 0.23143161173141066
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with an additional methyl group and a hydroxyl group. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with bicyclic or polycyclic frameworks and alcohol functionalities.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with polycyclic structures and alcohol groups tend to have positive property values, often influenced by the presence of additional functional groups or the complexity of the structure. For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCCC(C)O has a property value of 0.8188109, and it is a linear chain with an alcohol group. More complex structures like CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO have much higher values due to their complexity and functional groups.

Given the structure of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, it is less complex than the highly polycyclic examples but more complex than simple linear alcohols. Therefore, we can expect its property value to be positive but not as high as the most complex examples.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 would be around 0.5 to 1.0. However, without exact calculations or a more detailed model, this is an estimation. Let's choose a value within this range:

True Property: 6.294245028094351
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC) and a cyclic imide structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O). This structure is somewhat similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 28.02989825. The main difference is the presence of a sulfur atom in the example, which is replaced by a nitrogen atom in the target molecule.

Given the structural similarity, but considering the absence of the sulfur atom, which might contribute to a slightly lower property value, we can predict that the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O will be somewhat lower than 28.02989825.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 25.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of 1.62336425. Both molecules contain a benzene ring and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, but the example molecule is more complex with additional aromatic rings and a different substitution pattern.

Given the structural similarities and the presence of aromatic and heterocyclic features, we can expect the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C to be positive, but likely lower than 1.62336425 due to its simpler structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around 0.8 to 1.2. However, without exact calculations or a more detailed model, this is an estimation based on structural analogy.

True Property: -0.14983336857785562
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which is a linear chain with a total of 9 carbon atoms.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCCCC(=O)OC, which is a similar ester with a slightly shorter chain, has a property value of 0.37192072.
- CCCCCCCI, which is a linear alkane with an iodine atom, has a property value of 0.45870258.

Given that the molecule in question is an ester with a similar structure to CCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can expect the property value to be in a similar range. The presence of the ethyl group (OCC) instead of a methyl group (OC) might slightly increase the property value due to the additional carbon and hydrogen atoms.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be slightly higher than 0.37192072, possibly around 0.4 to 0.5. A specific predicted value could be approximately:

To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is methyl benzoate, an ester formed from benzoic acid and methanol.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and ester groups tend to have property values around the range of -0.3 to 2.0.
- For instance, CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 has a property value of -0.26772778, and CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.32248511.

Given that COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is structurally similar to these examples, particularly CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can predict that its property value will be close to these values.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.322.

To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a physicochemical property such as hydrophobicity, solubility, or a similar characteristic.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, also known as 1,3-butadiene. It is a relatively simple, small, and non-polar molecule. In the examples provided, small hydrocarbons and non-polar molecules tend to have negative property values. For instance, CC/C=C/C (a similar small hydrocarbon) has a property value of -0.77137404, and CCC(C)(C)CC (another small hydrocarbon) has a property value of -0.48279405.

Based on this pattern, we can predict that the property value for C=CCC=C will also be negative and likely in a similar range to these small hydrocarbons. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C would be approximately -0.7.

To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups, halogens, and the overall complexity of the molecule.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br, also known as tribromomethane or bromoform, is a simple halogenated compound with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples, molecules with multiple halogens, especially bromine, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of 0.01764665, and Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1.9526865.

Given the simplicity of BrC(Br)Br compared to the more complex aromatic structures with halogens, we can expect its property value to be positive but not as high as those with more complex structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 19.12365378.
- An amide linkage (N-C=O), which is present in several examples with varying property values.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is also present in the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1.
- A phenyl ring, which is a common feature in many examples with both positive and negative property values.

Given the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the structural similarity to the example with a high property value, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for this molecule will also be relatively high. However, the exact value will depend on the specific interactions and contributions of each functional group.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 18.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A tertiary amide group (CN(C)C(=O)N), similar to CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, which has a property value of -0.67754096.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of -0.52882109.
- A heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen, similar to Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2, which has a property value of 0.52357323.
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C), which is a bulky substituent.

Considering these features, the molecule has a combination of electron-withdrawing groups (chlorine and carbonyl) and electron-donating groups (tertiary amine), along with a bulky tert-butyl group that can influence the overall property.

Based on the examples, the presence of electron-withdrawing groups tends to lower the property value, while electron-donating groups and bulky groups can increase it. The molecule's complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups suggest a property value that is not extremely negative or positive.

Taking into account the structural similarities and the influence of the functional groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be around 0.5.

The molecule has two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with three chlorine atoms attached. Chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples tend to have property values around -0.1 to 0.5, depending on the number and position of chlorine atoms and other functional groups.

For instance, the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of -0.49122827, and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 has a property value of 0.48695481. The presence of an ether linkage and an additional chlorine atom in the target molecule might slightly increase the property value compared to Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be around -0.2.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC/C=C\C, we can look at the example provided for a similar molecule, CC/C=C/C, which has a property value of -0.77137404. The only difference between the two molecules is the stereochemistry around the double bond, which is unlikely to significantly affect the property value in this context. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C would be very close to that of CC/C=C/C.

Predicted property value for CC/C=C\C: -0.77137404

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.6647198088890071
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOCC is a simple linear ether, specifically diethyl ether. 

Looking at the examples, we can see that simple aliphatic hydrocarbons and ethers tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCC(O)CC has a property value of -0.6653892, and C1CCCCCC1 (cyclohexane) has a property value of -0.34778745. These examples suggest that simple, non-aromatic, and non-halogenated molecules tend to have negative property values.

Given that CCCOCC is a simple ether without any additional functional groups that would significantly increase the property value, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Considering the examples, a value slightly more negative than -0.34778745 (cyclohexane) but less negative than -0.6653892 (pentanol) seems appropriate.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC is approximately -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a tertiary amide with two phenyl rings and a tert-butyl group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 3.37810644. Both molecules contain a tertiary amide and two phenyl rings, although the example has an additional heterocyclic component.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of the tertiary amide and two phenyl rings, we can expect the property value to be in a similar range. However, the absence of the heterocyclic component in the molecule to be predicted might slightly lower the property value compared to the example.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be approximately 3.0.

1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains an amide group (CC(=O)N) and a brominated aromatic ring (c1ccc(Br)cc1). The presence of an amide group is similar to the structure CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 1.37097081. However, the presence of bromine, which is an electron-withdrawing group, might lower the property value.

2. **Aromatic Ring with Halogen**: The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 has a property value of -0.52408285, and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 has a property value of -0.53553963. These examples suggest that halogenated aromatic rings tend to have negative property values.

3. **Combination of Features**: The combination of an amide group and a brominated aromatic ring suggests a property value that might be slightly negative or close to zero, considering the electron-withdrawing effect of bromine and the electron-donating effect of the amide group.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around -0.2 to -0.5. Given the examples and the structural analysis, a specific predicted property value could be:

True Property: -0.21249355451049493
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the data. The molecule in question is isobutylbenzene, which consists of an isobutyl group (CC(C)C) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1).

From the examples, we can observe the following:

1. Molecules with simple alkyl chains attached to benzene rings, such as Cc1ccccc1N (-0.63248308) and CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.39217674), tend to have negative property values.

2. The presence of additional functional groups or complex structures tends to increase the property value, as seen in more complex molecules like CC1CCCCC1NC(=O)Nc2ccccc2 (1.81647921).

3. The presence of halogens or other electronegative groups can also influence the property value, as seen in Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.39647216).

Given that CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is a relatively simple molecule with an isobutyl group attached to a benzene ring, it is likely to have a property value similar to other simple alkylbenzenes. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 would be around -0.4 to -0.6.

Therefore, a specific predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 could be approximately -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:

1. Molecules with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups (like ketones and aldehydes) tend to have negative property values. For instance:
   - NC(=O)c1ccccc1O has a property value of -0.5834204.
   - CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of -0.02838545.

2. The presence of additional functional groups or substituents can influence the property value, but simple aromatic aldehydes or ketones without additional electron-withdrawing or donating groups tend to have values closer to zero or slightly negative.

Given that benzaldehyde is a simple aromatic aldehyde without additional substituents, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly negative, similar to other simple aromatic carbonyl compounds.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) would be around -0.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples.
- An aromatic ring with a heteroatom (oxygen), similar to some of the provided examples.
- A cyclic urea structure (O=C2CN...C(=O)N2), which is not directly present in the examples but can be related to other cyclic structures.

From the examples, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, especially when combined with other electron-withdrawing groups or heteroatoms. The presence of the cyclic urea might contribute to a slightly lower value compared to more complex aromatic systems.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is likely to be positive but not extremely high, as it lacks extensive aromatic conjugation or multiple electron-withdrawing groups.

A reasonable prediction for the property value could be around 0.5 to 1.0. Given the examples and the structural analysis, a specific prediction could be:

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.17433457551208284
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, which is similar to the example N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 with a property value of 0.1134287. The main difference between the two is the presence of a double bond in the example, which is absent in the target molecule.

The removal of the double bond in the target molecule results in a more flexible structure, which could potentially affect the property value. However, given the similarity in the aromatic systems and the overall structure, the property value is likely to be close to that of the example.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be slightly lower than 0.1134287, due to the increased flexibility and potential changes in electronic distribution. A predicted value could be approximately 0.05.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a relatively small and compact structure with two amide groups and a cyclohexane ring. In the examples, similar small cyclic structures with amide groups, such as C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1, have property values around 0.1.

Considering the structural similarity to the example C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1, which has a property value of 0.09795641, and the fact that the given molecule is also a small cyclic structure with amide groups, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be close to this value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately 0.1.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, tend to have higher property values. This particular example has a property value of 3.35587852.
- Simpler chlorinated aromatic compounds, such as Clc1ccccc1Cl, have lower property values, like -0.53370256.

The given molecule, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is more complex than Clc1ccccc1Cl due to the additional chlorine and the biphenyl structure, but less complex than the highly chlorinated example with a property value of 3.35587852.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would likely be between these two examples. Given the structure's complexity and the presence of multiple chlorine atoms, a reasonable prediction would be around 1.5 to 2.5.

From the examples, we can observe that simple aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions tend to have property values around the negative range. For instance, Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) has a property value of -0.63248308, and Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1 (a thioamide) has a property value of -0.55413136. Additionally, CCc1ccccn1 (an alkyl-substituted pyridine) has a property value of -0.57262481.

Considering the structure of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, which is a relatively simple aromatic compound with two ethyl groups, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be in the negative range, similar to the other simple aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is approximately -0.6.

The molecule you provided, c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon known as triphenylene. To predict its property value based on the examples given, we should consider the structural similarities and the nature of the property values provided.

The examples with high property values tend to be large, complex, and often polycyclic aromatic compounds. For instance, the molecule c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 has a property value of 2.17575067, and c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 has a property value of 2.69388077. These molecules are structurally similar to triphenylene in terms of being large, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Given this pattern, triphenylene is likely to have a property value in a similar range. Therefore, I would predict the property value for triphenylene (c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34) to be approximately 2.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the more complex aromatic structures in the examples, particularly those with multiple aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups.

From the examples, molecules with multiple aromatic rings and oxygen functionalities, such as OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl (3.40056733) and Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 (3.73248906), tend to have higher property values.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, which can increase the property value due to potential hydrogen bonding and increased molecular interactions, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 3.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 is approximately 3.5.

True Property: 1.3565910052681898
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)O), an amide group (NC(C)=O), and a thioether linkage (SC). The presence of the phosphorothioate group is significant, as it is a feature seen in some of the examples with higher property values, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (4.01979966) and COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (4.24204884).

However, the molecule in question is simpler and lacks the aromatic chlorinated rings that contribute to the higher property values in those examples. The presence of the amide group and the thioether linkage suggests a more moderate property value, as seen in other examples with similar functional groups.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is likely to be positive but not as high as the examples with extensive chlorination or complex aromatic systems. A reasonable estimate would be around 1.5 to 2.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is approximately 1.8.

To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, symmetrical molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. In the examples, molecules with halogen atoms (such as chlorine) and small, simple structures tend to have negative property values. For instance, Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of -0.49122827, and CCBr has a property value of -0.75668374.

Considering the simplicity and symmetry of Cl\C=C/Cl, along with the presence of chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be approximately -0.5.

True Property: -0.8066148961920347
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and their properties. Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle similar to benzene but with a nitrogen atom replacing one of the CH groups. 

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 (quinoline), have a property value of 0.15247064. Pyridine is simpler than quinoline, having only one nitrogen atom in a six-membered ring, which might suggest a lower property value compared to quinoline.

Additionally, other aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as CNc1ccccc1 (aniline), have a property value of -0.62049826. Pyridine is less electron-rich than aniline due to the presence of the nitrogen atom, which can withdraw electron density from the ring.

Considering these factors, pyridine is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative but not as low as aniline. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of pyridine (c1ccncc1) would be around -0.2.

1. An ester linkage (COC(=O)).
2. A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1).
3. An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23).
4. A pyridine-like structure (ccnc).

- Molecules with aromatic rings and amide linkages, such as CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2 (0.47854229) and O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 (0.47732415), tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of chlorine in aromatic rings, as seen in Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl (1.9526865), can significantly increase the property value, although this is in a highly chlorinated context.
- The presence of an ester linkage, as in CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC (0.5597872), also contributes to a positive property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 has features that suggest a positive property value, likely influenced by the aromatic, amide, and ester functionalities, as well as the presence of chlorine.

Based on these observations and comparisons, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the presence of electronegative atoms.

The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol with five carbon atoms and one hydroxyl group. From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Simple alkanes and alcohols tend to have negative property values. For instance, OC1CCCCCCC1 has a property value of -0.09702675, and CCC(C)Cl has a property value of -0.70001829.
2. The presence of a hydroxyl group (as in alcohols) tends to increase the property value slightly compared to alkanes of similar size.
3. The property values for small to medium-sized alkanes and alcohols are generally close to zero but negative.

Considering these observations, CCCCCO, being a simple alcohol with a moderate chain length, is likely to have a property value slightly higher than a similar alkane but still negative. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be around -0.1.

The molecule in question contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is known to increase polarity.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which also contributes to polarity and potential hydrogen bonding.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which can contribute to hydrophobic interactions.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can add to the molecule's polarity.

From the examples, molecules with polar functional groups like sulfonyl and amide tend to have positive property values, especially when combined with aromatic systems. For instance, the molecule CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C has a high positive value of 12.45184128, likely due to the presence of a phosphorothioate group and aromatic rings.

Considering these factors, the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is expected to have a positive property value, but not as high as those with more extensive aromatic systems or additional polar groups.

Based on the structural analysis and comparison with similar molecules, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be around 1.5.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:

1. **Aromatic Ring**: The presence of a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) is a common feature in many of the examples, often associated with a range of property values.

3. **Ester Groups (C(=O)OC)**: The molecule contains ester groups, which are also present in some examples like CCCCC(=O)OC, with a property value of -0.55910143.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring with Nitrogen**: The presence of a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen (C1=C(C)NC) is similar to structures like CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O, which has a property value of 0.9083293.

5. **Substituents and Overall Complexity**: The molecule has multiple substituents and a relatively complex structure, which can increase the property value, as seen in more complex molecules like CCN(CC)C(=S)SSC(=S)N(CC)CC with a property value of 6.22159098.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule's complexity, presence of nitro groups, and aromaticity suggest a property value that is likely positive and possibly in the range of moderately complex aromatic compounds with nitro groups.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately **1.5**.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two amide groups and a cyclohexane-like structure due to the cyclization of the peptide bond. This structure is relatively small and lacks large hydrophobic or aromatic groups, which often contribute to higher property values in the examples.

Looking at the examples, smaller molecules with polar functional groups, such as amides, tend to have negative property values. For instance, molecules like CC(Cl)CCl and OCc1ccccc1 have negative values, likely due to their polar nature and lack of extensive hydrophobic or aromatic systems.

Given the structure of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value, as it is a small, polar molecule without large hydrophobic or aromatic groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.5, considering the trends observed in the examples.

Considering these observations, the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is expected to have a positive property value due to the presence of the pyridine ring and the trichloromethyl group. The presence of nitrogen in the pyridine ring might slightly reduce the property value compared to a fully chlorinated benzene ring, but the overall effect of the trichloromethyl group should still result in a positive value.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl would be around 0.5.

   - ClC(Cl)Cl (chloroform) has a property value of -0.78408166.

2. The presence of bromine, which is a heavier halogen than chlorine, might slightly increase the property value compared to similar chlorinated compounds due to its larger size and polarizability.

Considering these points, 1,4-dibromobenzene is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative, similar to other simple halogenated aromatics. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around -0.5.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.512737361889908
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring, with a nitro group (NO2) also attached to the ring.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Aromatic compounds with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.52204059.
2. Aromatic compounds with methoxy groups, such as CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2, have a property value of 1.89450487.

The presence of both a methoxy group and a nitro group on the benzene ring suggests that the property value will be influenced by both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects. The methoxy group is an electron-donating group, while the nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group.

Considering the balance of these effects and the examples provided, the property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is likely to be slightly negative, as the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group is quite strong.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is approximately -0.5.

True Property: 5.8074673443231575
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 1.28197037. The given molecule has even more chlorine atoms and a more complex structure, which could potentially increase the property value due to increased molecular weight and potential for interactions.

Considering the trend that more chlorination and complex structures tend to increase the property value, I would predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is likely higher than 1.28197037. Given the complexity and high degree of chlorination, a reasonable prediction might be around 1.5 to 2.0.

Therefore, a predicted property value for the molecule could be approximately 1.8.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.7834295482928028
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCOC=O is a simple ester, specifically propyl formate. It consists of a propyl group (CCC) attached to a formate group (OC=O). Esters generally have moderate polarity due to the presence of the carbonyl group (C=O) and the ether linkage (C-O-C).

Looking at the examples, simple aliphatic chains like CCC#C and CCCCC#C have negative property values (-0.89349899 and -0.69954887, respectively). The presence of a carbonyl group in a small molecule like CCCOC=O might increase the property value slightly compared to a simple aliphatic chain, but it is still likely to be negative due to the overall non-polar nature of the alkyl chain.

Considering the examples and the structural features of CCCOC=O, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be around -0.5. This accounts for the slight increase due to the ester functionality compared to a simple alkane or alkyne.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC=O is approximately -0.5.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 1.32168092909583
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a simple ester, specifically decyl acetate, which consists of a long alkyl chain (10 carbon atoms) and an ester functional group.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with long alkyl chains, such as CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 (0.43808325) and CCCCCC(CC)C=O (-0.22456963), tend to have property values around the range of -0.2 to 0.4.
2. Esters, such as CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C (14.27178793), can have a wide range of property values depending on their complexity and functional groups.

Given that CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is a relatively simple ester with a long alkyl chain, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be slightly positive, similar to other long-chain molecules.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 0.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to the aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.52882109.
- Molecules with phenol groups, such as Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1, have a property value of -0.33262506.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, have a property value of -0.62244597.

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro and chloro groups generally leads to more negative property values. The combination of these groups in the molecule suggests a property value that is likely negative and possibly more negative than the individual components due to the cumulative electron-withdrawing effects.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be around -0.5 to -0.6. Therefore, a specific predicted property value could be:

-0.55

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are similar to the phosphorothioate group in the molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 19.12365378. The presence of these groups suggests a potentially high property value due to their electron-withdrawing nature and the overall complexity of the molecule.

Additionally, the molecule has aromatic rings with sulfur linkages, which can contribute to the property value. The presence of multiple aromatic rings and the phosphorothioate groups suggests that the property value could be significantly positive.

Considering these factors and comparing with the example molecules, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 would be in the higher range, similar to the example with a phosphorothioate group.

Therefore, a predicted property value for this molecule could be approximately 18.0.

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6277588931790757
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) and a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can see that molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (nitrobenzene), have a property value of -0.5474485. Additionally, molecules with phenol groups, such as Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 (chlorophenol), have a property value of -0.61606596.

Considering the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group and the electron-donating nature of the hydroxyl group, the overall effect on the property value is likely to be similar to that of nitrobenzene, but slightly more negative due to the additional electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group on the phenol.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be slightly more negative than -0.5474485, possibly around -0.6. However, given the examples and the nature of the molecule, a specific predicted property value could be approximately:

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. This molecule is a complex carbohydrate, likely a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide, characterized by multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages.

From the examples, it appears that the property values are influenced by the presence of functional groups, molecular size, and complexity. Carbohydrates, with their numerous hydroxyl groups, tend to have lower property values due to their polar nature and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Given the structure's complexity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, the property value is likely to be negative, similar to other polar and hydrogen-bonding-rich molecules in the examples. Considering the examples of other molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and their property values, a reasonable prediction for this molecule would be around -0.5 to -0.6.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the given molecule is approximately -0.55.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -0.8934989934953718
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne. It has a triple bond between the second and third carbon atoms. In the examples, linear alkanes and alkenes with similar carbon chain lengths tend to have negative property values, often related to their hydrophobic nature and lack of polar functional groups.

For instance:
- CCC(C)C(=O)C has a property value of -0.61373905.
- CCC(C)OC=O has a property value of -0.80428361.
- CCC(C)OC(C)C has a property value of -0.58712076.

Given that CCC#C is a small, non-polar molecule with a triple bond, it is likely to have a property value in the negative range, similar to other small hydrocarbons.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be approximately -0.6.

- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 2.67890972.

The presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a potentially high property value, while the chlorinated aromatic ring suggests a moderate increase in the property value. Considering these factors and the examples provided, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be higher than the chlorinated aromatic compounds but lower than the compound with the phosphorothioate group and additional functional groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl would be around 10.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a pyridine derivative with a carbonyl group attached to a hydrazine moiety.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro or carbonyl) tend to have positive or less negative property values.
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings or complex structures tend to have higher property values.
- Simple aliphatic chains or halogenated compounds often have negative property values.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 has a single aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and a hydrazine moiety, which is somewhat similar to the structure of Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2, which has a property value of -0.53393309. However, the presence of the hydrazine group might slightly increase the property value due to its potential for hydrogen bonding and increased polarity.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is likely to be slightly negative, but closer to zero than the example with a similar structure. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.3.

True Property: 32.66799890856247
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, which has a property value of 2.96548223.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is present in several molecules with varying property values.
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1), which is a saturated nitrogen-containing ring.

The presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a relatively high property value, as seen in the example with a similar group. The amide linkage and piperidine ring are common in molecules with moderate to high property values.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the predicted property value for CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is likely to be moderately high. A reasonable estimate would be around 2.5.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.17325777317060576
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (n-octane), we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the size and functional groups present in the molecules.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Simple alkanes and alcohols with no or few functional groups tend to have negative property values.
- The property value becomes more negative as the chain length increases, as seen with molecules like CCCCCC (hexane) and CCCCCCCO (heptanol).

Given that CCCCCCCC is a straight-chain alkane (octane) with no functional groups, we can expect its property value to be similar to or slightly more negative than those of other simple alkanes or alcohols with similar chain lengths.

For example:
- CCCCCCCO (heptanol) has a property value of -0.33874327.
- CCCCCC (hexane) is not explicitly listed, but based on the trend, we can infer it would have a slightly less negative value than heptanol.

Therefore, for CCCCCCCC (octane), we can predict a property value slightly more negative than that of heptanol. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.4 to -0.5.

Thus, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCC is approximately -0.45.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbonyl group (C=O), as well as an alkyne group (C#C). The presence of these functional groups and the overall complexity of the structure suggest that it might have a relatively high property value, similar to other complex polycyclic structures in the examples.

For instance, the molecule CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO has a property value of 13.74227481, and it shares some structural similarities with the target molecule, such as the presence of multiple rings and functional groups like hydroxyl and carbonyl.

Considering these factors, I would predict that the property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is likely to be in a similar range, but slightly lower due to the presence of the alkyne group, which might reduce the overall property value compared to the example with a fluorine atom and more extensive ring systems.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately 10.5.

True Property: 68.03531934282495
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like the one you've provided involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples given. The molecule in question is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and hydroxyl groups, as well as a fused ring system.

From the examples, we can observe that large, complex, and polycyclic structures with multiple functional groups tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule with the SMILES "C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21" has a very high property value of 46.2585573, likely due to its large size and complexity.

The molecule you provided, "COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67", also features a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and hydroxyl groups, suggesting a potentially high property value.

Considering these factors and the trend observed in the examples, I would predict a relatively high property value for this molecule. However, without specific computational tools or models, this prediction is qualitative. Based on the complexity and functional groups present, a reasonable estimate might be in the range of 20 to 60, similar to the example with a high property value.

Therefore, a specific predicted property value for this molecule could be approximately 50.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's consider the examples with similar structures:
- Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (nitrophenol) has a property value of -0.62775889.
- Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (another nitrophenol) has a property value of -0.62615436.
- Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) has a property value of -0.75586533.
- Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) is not directly listed, but we can infer from similar halogenated benzenes.

The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) generally contributes to a more negative property value due to its polar nature, while the presence of a chlorine atom (Cl) can also contribute to a negative value, but less so than a hydroxyl group.

Given these considerations, the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is likely to be negative and somewhat similar to the nitrophenol examples, but slightly less negative due to the presence of chlorine instead of a nitro group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around -0.6. However, considering the specific examples and the influence of chlorine, a more precise estimate might be slightly less negative, around -0.65.

- An ester linkage (OC(=O)), which is polar and can contribute to solubility and reactivity.
- An amide group (NC(=O)), which is polar and can engage in hydrogen bonding.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1), which is similar to some of the examples with chlorinated aromatic rings.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with chlorinated aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (3.58127337) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (2.67890972), tend to have positive property values.
- Molecules with amide groups, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1 (-0.48493285), tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in the examples with higher positive values.

Considering these factors, the presence of the chlorinated aromatic ring and the amide group might balance each other out, leading to a property value that is slightly positive but not as high as those with multiple chlorines or larger structures.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around 0.5.

- Two of these rings are chlorinated phenyl rings, and one is a pyrimidine ring.

From the examples:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substitutions tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles (like pyrimidine) can also influence the property value, often leading to a more positive value compared to simple hydrocarbons or less complex structures.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a positive property value, influenced by the aromatic and halogenated nature of the structure, as well as the presence of the pyrimidine ring.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl would be around 2.5.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCC(=O)OCC, which is a similar ester with a longer alkyl chain, has a property value of -0.53264217.
- CCCCCCC=O, which is a ketone with a similar alkyl chain length, has a property value of -0.56680382.

The presence of the ester functional group in CCCCCOC=O is similar to CCCCC(=O)OCC, but with a shorter alkyl chain. Esters generally have slightly less negative property values compared to ketones due to their polar nature and the presence of the oxygen atom in the ester linkage.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCCCOC=O is likely to be slightly more negative than CCCCC(=O)OCC but not as negative as CCCCCCC=O. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be around -0.55.

The molecule ClCCl is a simpler structure, being dichloromethane, compared to ClCCCl, which is 1,2-dichloroethane. Given the trend that smaller and simpler molecules tend to have more negative property values, we can predict that ClCCl will have a slightly more negative property value than ClCCCl.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be approximately -0.80.

This structure is similar to the example CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, which has a property value of -0.17747252. Both molecules have a benzene ring with alkyl and hydroxyl substituents, which suggests they might have similar properties.

Given the structural similarity, the predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is likely to be close to -0.17747252. Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is approximately -0.18.

- Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl with a property value of -0.09994673

The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a simpler structure compared to the second example but more complex than the third. It is a biphenyl with four chlorine atoms, similar to the first example but with a different arrangement.

Considering the structural similarities and the trend in the property values, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl would likely be between the values of the first and second examples, but closer to the first due to the simpler structure.

Looking at the examples, we can see that small hydrocarbons with similar structures, such as alkanes and alkenes, tend to have property values around zero or slightly negative. For instance:

- CCCCCCCC (octane) has a property value of -0.17325777.
- CCCCCCCC=C (a similar alkene) has a property value of 0.14570431.

Given that CC=C(C)C is a small branched alkene, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be close to these examples. Considering the slight increase in property value for the presence of a double bond, we can estimate a property value slightly above zero.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C is approximately 0.1.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.8516425742625939
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane), we can analyze the trends in the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 4.67516891, and ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of 5.80746734. These are complex aromatic or polycyclic structures with multiple chlorine atoms.

However, simpler molecules with chlorine atoms, such as ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl, have a lower property value of -0.65806751. The molecule ClCCl is even simpler, being a small, non-aromatic molecule with only two chlorine atoms.

Given this analysis, ClCCl is expected to have a property value that is negative and likely lower than the more complex chlorinated structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around -0.7, considering its simplicity and the trend observed in the examples.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.3143583311500623
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

In the examples, we have a similar molecule: Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which is 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, with a property value of -0.3167471. The structure of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is very similar, with the same number of chlorine atoms and a hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring.

Given the similarity in structure, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl will be very close to that of Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl. Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is approximately -0.3167471.

True Property: 68.03531934282495
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be quite complex, with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and a significant degree of substitution. It also contains several oxygen-containing functional groups, which can influence the property value.

Based on the examples provided, molecules with complex structures, multiple rings, and significant functionalization tend to have higher property values. For instance, molecules like O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 and CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C have high property values of 10.19029481 and 9.00708742, respectively.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups in the molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, it is reasonable to predict a relatively high property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the given molecule is approximately 8.5.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.7694005273733243
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of the thiosemicarbazide moiety suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and polar interactions, while the tert-butyl group contributes to hydrophobicity and steric bulk.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar functional groups and structural features tend to have property values in the range of 0.5 to 2.5. For instance, CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a property value of 1.57292405, which is a similar structure with a thiosemicarbazide-like moiety and a tert-butyl group.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be around 1.5. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

1.5

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.3224851128010315
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ester group (COOC) attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings and ester groups tend to have property values around the range of -0.1 to 0.5. For instance, the molecule CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of -0.1027829, and it contains a similar aromatic structure with carbonyl groups.

Considering the structural similarities and the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around 0.0 to 0.5. Given the specific examples and their values, a more precise prediction would be:

0.1

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.18922654270417172
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their properties. The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom at the end. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Linear alkyl chains tend to have negative property values, such as CCCCCCCCO (-0.33874327) and CCCCCCC=C (-0.33863856).
- The presence of a halogen, such as bromine, can slightly increase the property value compared to similar structures without halogens. For instance, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of 0.01764665, which is slightly positive.

Considering these observations, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be slightly less negative than similar alkyl chains without halogens. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around -0.3. 

Thus, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr is approximately -0.3.

SMILES: CO
True Property: -1.0105844823159527
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a calculated property such as a partition coefficient (logP) or a similar descriptor. Smaller, simpler molecules with fewer functional groups and less complexity tend to have more negative values, while larger, more complex molecules with multiple functional groups tend to have higher values.

The molecule CO (carbon monoxide) is a very simple diatomic molecule with no functional groups or complex structure. Based on the trend observed in the examples, simpler molecules like CCC (propane) and CC#C (propyne) have negative values. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that CO will also have a negative property value.

Given the simplicity and small size of CO, I would predict a property value of approximately -1.0.
