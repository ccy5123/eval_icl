Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the trends in the given examples. The molecule is a linear ester with a long carbon chain, similar to some of the examples provided.

Looking at the examples:
- CCCCCCCC(C)O has a property value of -0.1494452.
- CCCCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of 0.96639036.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is similar to CCCCCCCC(=O)OC but with an additional carbon in the chain.

True Property: -0.27106917997738333
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a fused heterocyclic structure, specifically a chlorinated benzoxazole. The presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in several examples. The heterocyclic structure with an oxygen and nitrogen atom in the ring can also influence the property value, often leading to a moderate increase.

Comparing with similar structures:
- The molecule Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 0.23399166, which is a chlorinated aromatic compound.
- The molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 has a property value of -0.39413507, which is a less chlorinated aromatic compound.

Considering these comparisons and the structural features of the given molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around 0.1. This accounts for the influence of the chlorine atom and the heterocyclic structure.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have negative property values. Additionally, smaller aliphatic molecules like CCC(C)CC and CCCCCl also have negative property values.

Considering these observations, the presence of the nitro group, and the relatively small size of the molecule, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O. Based on the trends in the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.3 to -0.7.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O could be approximately:

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. The presence of a bromine atom and carbonyl groups can influence the property value, as seen in some of the examples.

Let's analyze the examples:

1. Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br) and carbonyl groups tend to have positive property values, such as:
   - Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl: 3.15946739
   - Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O: 3.46458368
   - ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2: 2.88212557

2. Molecules with carbonyl groups and aromatic systems without halogens tend to have lower or negative values, such as:
   - CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1: -0.00355366
   - CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1: -0.25116819

3. The presence of a pyrrole ring, as seen in:
   - Nc1nccs1: -0.68143004
   - CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O: This molecule has a pyrrole ring with additional substituents.

Considering these observations, the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O has a pyrrole ring with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. The presence of the bromine atom and carbonyl groups suggests a positive influence on the property value, but the pyrrole ring and the overall structure may moderate this effect.

Based on the examples and structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O would be around 0.5.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.16515306600372284
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the size, aromaticity, and presence of functional groups.

Biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic compound consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples, similar aromatic compounds with multiple benzene rings tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34, which is a polycyclic aromatic compound, has a property value of 3.40858754. Another example, c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67, which is a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a property value of 9.47738117.

Given that biphenyl is simpler than these larger polycyclic aromatic compounds but more complex than a single benzene ring, its property value is likely to be between those of simpler aromatic compounds and more complex polycyclic ones. Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around 1.5 to 2.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 is approximately:

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.6356710643064837
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCCCS is a linear alkane chain with a sulfur atom at the end, which is similar to the structure of alkanes and simple sulfur-containing compounds.

From the examples, we observe that linear alkanes like CCCCCCC=C and CCCCCCC(C)C have property values of -0.2075176 and -0.3674446, respectively. These values are negative, indicating that linear alkanes tend to have negative property values. The presence of a sulfur atom, which is more electronegative than carbon, might slightly alter the property value, but it is unlikely to make it positive given the trend observed in the examples.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for CCCCCS is likely to be slightly negative, similar to other linear alkanes. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS is approximately -0.3.
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.4632900747755164
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol, specifically 2-methyl-2-butanol. In the examples, we have several aliphatic and branched hydrocarbons, as well as alcohols, which can help us make a prediction:

1. CCC(C)(C)C (2,2-dimethylbutane) has a property value of -0.6142039.
2. CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O (a cyclic alcohol) has a property value of -0.05284982.
3. CCC(C)(C)C (2,2-dimethylpropane) has a property value of -0.20926496.

The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) in CCCC(C)(C)CO will likely increase the property value compared to a similar hydrocarbon without the OH group, as seen in the examples. The closest example with an alcohol group is CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O, which has a property value of -0.05284982.

Considering the structural similarity and the effect of the hydroxyl group, the predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is likely to be slightly negative, but closer to zero than the purely hydrocarbon examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO is approximately -0.1.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a property value of 1.17047034.
- Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (another naphthalene derivative) has a property value of 0.24870092.

The molecule in question, Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, is structurally similar to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, which is also a naphthalene derivative. Given the similarity in structure, we can expect the property value to be close to that of Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately 0.24870092.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is a cyclic compound with a urea-like structure, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -0.1675864.

The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of a longer alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the new molecule compared to the methyl group (C) in the example. This additional alkyl chain could slightly increase the hydrophobicity and potentially the property value, but not drastically, as the core structure remains the same.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be slightly higher than -0.1675864, but still close to it. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.1.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.5752122420067356
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have property values around the range of -0.5 to 0.5, depending on the specific substituents and their positions. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of -0.18459322, and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of -0.46239098.

The trifluoromethyl group is electron-withdrawing and can influence the property value. Given the examples and the nature of the trifluoromethyl group, we can predict that the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would likely be slightly negative, reflecting the electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around -0.3.

To predict the property value for the molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is a sugar, specifically a hexose, which is a type of carbohydrate. 

From the examples, we can see that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (OH) tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO has a property value of -0.39191674. The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups generally increases the polarity and hydrophilicity of the molecule, which often correlates with lower property values in this context.

Given that OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a cyclic form of a sugar with several hydroxyl groups, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and similar to other polyhydroxylated compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O would be approximately -0.4.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C

This molecule appears to be a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. It resembles some of the more complex structures in the examples, such as:

- CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of 6.58093762.
- CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C, which has a property value of 4.17329955.

Both of these examples have high property values, likely due to their complex polycyclic structures and the presence of multiple functional groups that can contribute to the overall property.

Given the structural similarity of the target molecule to these examples, particularly the presence of multiple rings and ketone groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will also be relatively high. However, the presence of an ester group and additional hydroxyl groups might slightly lower the value compared to the first example.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 5.5.

It resembles some of the more complex structures in the examples, such as CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 2.65020451. This example also contains multiple cyclohexane rings and an alcohol group, similar to the given molecule.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of similar functional groups, the predicted property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O is likely to be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 2.5.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is an acetanilide derivative with a nitro group attached to the aromatic ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example O=N(=O)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.53471543. The presence of the acetamide group (CC(=O)N-) might slightly alter the property value compared to the nitrobenzene example.

Considering the influence of the acetamide group, which might slightly increase the property value due to its electron-donating nature compared to the nitro group alone, we can predict a property value that is slightly higher than -0.53471543.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O would be approximately -0.45.

True Property: 4.901495609207806
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)SC), which is not directly represented in the examples but can be considered similar to other sulfur-containing groups.
- An aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent, similar to Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (0.02022094) and Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl (0.80838096).
- An ester linkage (n1c(=O)oc2), which is present in some of the examples with varying effects on the property value.

Considering these features, the molecule has a combination of aromatic, halogen, and sulfur-containing groups, which tend to have moderate to slightly positive property values based on the examples. The presence of the phosphorothioate group might introduce a unique effect, but without a direct comparison, we can only estimate based on similar functionalities.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be around 0.5. This value reflects the influence of the aromatic and halogen groups, with a slight adjustment for the sulfur-containing phosphorothioate group.

Looking at the examples, we can see that simple alcohols and hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCC (propane) has a property value of -0.85122076, and CC(C)CO (isobutanol) has a property value of -0.76403753. The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) in alcohols generally increases the property value compared to hydrocarbons of similar size, but it remains negative.

Given that tert-butanol is similar to isobutanol but with a slightly more branched structure, we can expect its property value to be in the same range as isobutanol, possibly slightly less negative due to the increased branching.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO (tert-butanol) would be around -0.75.

The molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is a bicyclic compound with two nitrogen-containing heterocycles, specifically a purine-like structure. This structure is similar to nucleobases, which are generally polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding due to the presence of nitrogen atoms and carbonyl groups.

Looking at the examples, we can find a few molecules with similar features:
- Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F has a property value of -0.62559347. This molecule contains a nitrogen heterocycle with a carbonyl group and a fluorine atom, which contributes to its polarity.
- Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1 has a property value of -0.62467833. This molecule also contains a nitrogen heterocycle with a carbonyl group, similar to the target molecule.

Both of these examples have negative property values, indicating that the presence of nitrogen heterocycles and carbonyl groups tends to result in negative property values, likely due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding potential.

Given the structural similarity of O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 to these examples, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is approximately -0.62.

Looking at the examples, we can see that small esters and alcohols tend to have negative property values. For instance, CC(C)O (isopropanol) has a property value of -0.83265345, and CCC(C)(C)C (2,2-dimethylpropane) has a property value of -0.6142039. Esters like CCC(C)C(=O)C (pentan-2-one) have a property value of -0.60547449.

Given that CC(C)OC=O is a small ester, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and likely in a similar range to these examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around -0.6. 

Thus, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O is approximately -0.6.

The molecule in question has two phenyl groups connected through a urea linkage, which is somewhat similar to the structure of NC(=O)c1cccnc1, which has a property value of -0.5432994. However, the presence of two phenyl groups might slightly alter the property value.

Considering the examples and the structural features, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 would be around -0.5. This accounts for the influence of the aromatic rings and the urea linkage, which is similar to the example with a pyridine ring. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

Similarly, the molecule Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of -0.36195593, with halogenated aromatic rings.

Considering the polar nature of the sulfonamide and guanidine groups, along with the aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be slightly positive, reflecting moderate solubility and interaction potential.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 would be around 0.5.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 2.4644964967341108
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with positive property values.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which is an electron-withdrawing group and can influence the property value.
- An alkene group (C=C) attached to the nitrogen, which is less common in the examples but can contribute to the overall property.

Based on the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups on aromatic rings, such as Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have negative property values.
- Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like Cl or F on aromatic rings, such as CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1, have positive property values.
- The presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro and trifluoromethyl) can increase the property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a positive property value, but not as high as those with extensive conjugation or larger structures. A reasonable prediction, considering the influence of the nitro and trifluoromethyl groups, would be around 1.5 to 2.5.

Therefore, a predicted property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O could be approximately 2.0.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.758075511651288
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. Esters generally have a range of property values depending on their specific structure. In the examples, we have several esters and related compounds:

1. CC(C)CCOC=O, with a property value of -0.57457121.
2. CCC(C)(C)O, with a property value of -0.68020545.
3. CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, with a property value of -0.07633147.
4. CCCCCCOC(=O)C, with a property value of -0.45244959.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is structurally similar to CC(C)CCOC=O, but with a shorter carbon chain. The property value for CC(C)CCOC=O is -0.57457121, and shorter chains typically result in slightly more negative values due to reduced hydrophobic interactions.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be slightly more negative than -0.57457121. Therefore, a predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O could be approximately -0.600.

True Property: -0.4107568534572039
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the other aromatic compounds in the examples.

1. **Aromatic Ring**: The molecule contains a benzene ring, which is common in several examples. Aromatic rings often contribute to a property value around neutral or slightly positive, depending on additional substituents.

2. **Hydroxyl Group (O)**: The presence of a hydroxyl group (phenol) can influence the property value. In the examples, phenol (c1ccccc1O) has a property value of -0.64948127, indicating a slightly negative contribution.

3. **Methyl Groups (C)**: The molecule has two methyl groups attached to the benzene ring. Methyl groups are generally electron-donating and can slightly increase the property value. For example, toluene (Cc1ccccc1) has a property value of -0.31572026.

Considering these factors, the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is expected to have a property value that is slightly negative, influenced by the phenol group, but not as negative as phenol itself due to the presence of the methyl groups.

Based on the analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be around -0.3.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 1.7547893865224389
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S) with methoxy groups (OC) and a substituted aromatic ring. The examples provided show that similar structures with phosphorothioate groups and halogenated aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, often in the range of 1.5 to 2.5. However, the presence of a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) on the aromatic ring may influence the property value.

Considering the examples:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has a property value of 1.89542039.
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has a property value of 2.55878823.
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of 1.58955584.

These examples suggest that the presence of halogens on the aromatic ring increases the property value. In the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, the halogens are replaced by a thiomethyl group and a methyl group, which are less electronegative and may result in a lower property value compared to the halogenated examples.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 to be slightly lower than the halogenated examples, around 1.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples given.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 3.15946739, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 4.09354361. Both of these are highly chlorinated aromatic compounds, and the property values are relatively high compared to less chlorinated or non-aromatic compounds.

The molecule in question, Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is also a highly chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to the examples with high property values. Based on this comparison, we can predict that the property value for this molecule will also be relatively high.

Given the structural similarity to the examples with property values of 3.15946739 and 4.09354361, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 3.5.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.760273954356653
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl chain with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to the end. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Simple alkanes like CCC (propane) have negative property values, such as -0.85122076.
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.09368748, which is closer to zero but still negative.

Considering the structure of CCCN(=O)=O, it is a small molecule with a nitro group, which tends to increase the property value compared to simple alkanes but still results in a negative value due to the overall small size and lack of additional functional groups that significantly increase the property value.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around -0.5. This accounts for the presence of the nitro group, which increases the value compared to simple alkanes, but not enough to make it positive or close to zero.

True Property: -0.5088193192872554
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent. 

Looking at the examples, we have:

- COc1ccccc1Cl with a property value of -0.39790425
- Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O with a property value of -0.40311083

These examples suggest that halogenated benzenes tend to have negative property values, typically in the range of -0.3 to -0.4. The presence of a fluorine atom, which is highly electronegative, might slightly influence the property value compared to chlorine or bromine alone.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be around -0.35.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with a hydroxyl group, which is similar to a norbornane derivative. The presence of the hydroxyl group can influence the property value, as seen in other examples where functional groups like alcohols and carbonyls affect the property.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar complexity and functional groups, such as CC1CCCO1 (-0.71693694) and CC(C)(C)CO (-0.68114771), have negative property values. The presence of the hydroxyl group in the bicyclic structure might slightly increase the property value compared to a simple cyclic alkane.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is likely to be slightly negative, around -0.7. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is:

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)
- An amide linkage (N2C(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)
- A cyclic imide structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)

Comparing this structure to the examples:
- The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O has a similar phosphorothioate group and a cyclic imide structure, with a property value of 6.49001155.
- The presence of the phenyl ring and the cyclic imide structure is common in both molecules.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the phosphorothioate group and the cyclic imide, the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is likely to be close to that of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is approximately 6.49.

True Property: 0.38435912414467793
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzoyl group attached to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, specifically a methylated benzotriazole. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of 2.37484791. Both molecules contain aromatic rings and nitrogen heterocycles, but the example molecule is more complex with additional aromatic rings and a ketone group.

Considering the structural similarities and the complexity of the molecule, the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is likely to be positive but lower than 2.37484791 due to its simpler structure. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around 1.5. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is approximately 1.5.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.30831735940877014
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which consists of a heptanoic acid moiety (CCCCCCC(=O)O) and an ethyl group (CC).

Looking at the examples, we have:

1. CCCCCCC(=O)OC, which is a similar ester with a methyl group instead of an ethyl group, has a property value of 0.07050244.
2. CCCCCCCCI, which is a heptane derivative with an iodine atom, has a property value of -0.03973242.

The addition of an ethyl group instead of a methyl group in the ester might slightly increase the property value due to the increased molecular size and potential for slightly different interactions. However, the change is not expected to be drastic.

Considering these points, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be slightly higher than 0.07050244, but not significantly so. A predicted value could be around 0.1.

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.4046879362404902
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is methyl benzoate, an ester with a benzene ring.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 with a property value of -0.18869767. This molecule is ethyl salicylate, an ester with a benzene ring and an additional hydroxyl group.
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 with a property value of -0.25116819. This molecule is ethyl benzoate, an ester with a benzene ring, similar to methyl benzoate but with an ethyl group instead of a methyl group.

Given that methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1) is structurally similar to ethyl benzoate but with a slightly smaller alkyl group, we can expect its property value to be close to that of ethyl benzoate. The presence of a smaller alkyl group might slightly decrease the property value compared to ethyl benzoate.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate) would be slightly less than -0.25116819. A predicted value could be around -0.3.

True Property: -0.7102757933305367
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the overall molecular structure.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, making it a conjugated diene. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons and molecules with similar unsaturation levels tend to have negative property values. For instance, CC/C=C/C has a property value of -0.70853549, and CCC(=O)C has a value of -0.77935303.

Given the structure of C=CCC=C and its similarity to other unsaturated hydrocarbons, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and in a similar range to those examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C is approximately -0.7.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is tribromomethane, a simple halogenated methane derivative. In the examples, simpler molecules with halogen substitutions, such as FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br, tend to have negative property values. The presence of multiple bromine atoms, which are heavy and electronegative, might contribute to a more negative property value due to their influence on molecular properties like polarity and electron distribution.

Considering these factors and the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be a negative value. Given the simplicity and the presence of three bromine atoms, a predicted property value could be around -0.7. However, without a precise model or additional context, this is an estimation based on the observed trends.

Therefore, the predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br is approximately -0.7.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 5.98725652.
- An amide linkage (N-C=O) within a cyclic structure, similar to the example CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O, which has a property value of 0.79578785.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is present in several examples with varying effects on the property value.

Considering these features, the molecule is likely to have a property value influenced by the presence of the phosphorothioate group, which tends to increase the property value, and the amide linkage, which may moderate it. The presence of the chlorinated carbon may also contribute to a moderate increase.

Based on these considerations and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 4.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A tertiary amide group (CN(C)C(=O)N).
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)).
- A heterocyclic moiety (n2nc(oc2=O)).
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C).

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens (e.g., Cl) tend to have positive or slightly negative property values.
- The presence of nitro groups (N(=O)=O) often results in negative property values.
- Larger, more complex structures with multiple rings and heteroatoms can have higher positive property values.

Considering these factors, the given molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, including a chlorinated aromatic ring and a heterocyclic moiety, which could contribute to a positive property value. However, the presence of the amide and the tert-butyl group might moderate this effect.

Based on these considerations and the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be slightly positive, around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with three chlorine atoms attached to the rings. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 0.80838096. The presence of additional chlorine atoms in the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl could increase the property value due to the electron-withdrawing nature of chlorine, which can affect the electronic properties of the molecule.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of chlorine atoms, the predicted property value for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is likely to be slightly higher than 0.80838096. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 1.0.

True Property: -0.7085354940042888
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC/C=C\C, we can look at the examples provided and identify similar structures and their associated property values. The molecule CC/C=C\C is a simple linear alkene, specifically 2-butene.

In the examples, the molecule CC/C=C/C, which is also 2-butene but with a different stereochemistry (trans vs. cis), has a property value of -0.70853549. Since stereochemistry can have a minor effect on certain properties, but the overall structure and size of the molecule remain the same, we can reasonably predict that the property value for CC/C=C\C (cis-2-butene) will be very close to that of CC/C=C/C (trans-2-butene).

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C is approximately -0.70853549.

Looking at the examples, simple alkanes and ethers tend to have negative property values. For instance, CC(C)O has a property value of -0.83265345, and CCC(O)CC has a value of -0.68020545. These examples suggest that the presence of an ether group and a relatively simple structure contribute to a negative property value.

Given the structure of CCCOCC, which is a simple ether with no additional complex functional groups or aromatic rings, it is reasonable to predict a property value in the negative range, similar to other simple ethers and alkanes.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be approximately -0.7.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

This molecule is a tertiary amide with two phenyl rings and a tert-butyl group. The presence of aromatic rings and the amide functional group suggests that the property value might be positive, as seen in similar structures in the examples.

Comparing it to similar structures:
- CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 has a property value of 3.70233014.
- Cc1c2ccccc2c(C)c3ccc4ccccc4c13 has a property value of 4.40742175.
- Nc1cccc2ccccc12 has a property value of -0.00746646, but it lacks the amide group.

Given the presence of the amide group and two phenyl rings, the property value is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to the first example, but possibly lower due to the lack of additional heteroatoms or complex ring systems.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be around 2.5.

Considering these structural similarities, particularly the presence of the bromobenzene moiety and the acetamide group, the property value is likely to be negative and close to the values of similar structures.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be approximately -0.48.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is isobutylbenzene, which consists of an isobutyl group (CC(C)C) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1).

Looking at the examples, we can find similar structures:

1. CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethylbenzene) has a property value of -0.31572026.
2. Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) has a property value of -0.4684215.
3. Cc1cccc2ccccc12 (naphthalene) has a property value of 0.00749277.

The structure of isobutylbenzene is similar to ethylbenzene, with an additional methyl group on the side chain. The presence of the benzene ring generally contributes to a property value around the range of -0.3 to 0.0, as seen in ethylbenzene and naphthalene.

Considering the additional branching in the isobutyl group compared to ethylbenzene, which might slightly increase the property value due to increased hydrophobicity and steric effects, we can predict a property value slightly higher than that of ethylbenzene.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 (isobutylbenzene) would be around -0.25.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:

1. Molecules with benzene rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro groups) tend to have negative property values, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (-0.43902701) and O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O (-0.34255893).

2. Molecules with benzene rings and electron-donating groups or less polar groups tend to have property values closer to zero or slightly positive, such as COc1ccccc1 (-0.53730134) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (-0.09042291).

3. The presence of an aldehyde group (C=O) in a molecule like CC(=C)C1CC=C(C)C(=O)C1 (-0.09805893) suggests a slightly negative property value.

Considering these observations, benzaldehyde has a benzene ring with an aldehyde group, which is an electron-withdrawing group. This suggests a property value that is likely negative but not as negative as molecules with multiple strong electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) would be around -0.3.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.23643821418532576
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring, similar to some of the examples. The presence of the nitro group (N(=O)=O) and the heterocyclic structure (a lactam ring) are key features that can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings, such as Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 (1.50766818), tend to have positive property values. The presence of a heterocyclic structure, like in Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 (-0.27106918), can also influence the property, but the nitro group seems to have a stronger effect.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is likely to be positive, but not as high as the example with multiple nitro groups and aromatic rings. A reasonable estimate would be around 0.5 to 1.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately 0.75.

True Property: 0.6759134648813833
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group (N-N linkage).

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of nitrogen atoms in aromatic systems can influence the property value, often increasing it compared to similar structures without nitrogen.

The molecule N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which is similar in structure but with a different nitrogen linkage, has a property value of 0.46656261. The given molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally similar, with the main difference being the type of nitrogen linkage (hydrazine vs. azo).

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would likely be close to that of N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, but slightly lower due to the different nitrogen linkage. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.4.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diketopiperazine, a cyclic dipeptide, which is structurally similar to some of the examples given.

The closest example in the list is C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1, which is also a cyclic dipeptide and has a property value of -0.00833625. The molecule in question, O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, is structurally similar but lacks the additional alkyl group branching off the nitrogen atoms, which might slightly affect its property value.

Considering the structural similarity and the potential impact of the additional alkyl group in the example, the property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be close to that of the example, but possibly slightly lower due to the absence of the alkyl group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.05.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, tend to have higher property values. This particular example has a property value of 3.71564671.
- Simpler chlorinated aromatic compounds, like Clc1ccccc1Cl, have lower property values, such as -0.44373403.

The given molecule, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is more complex than Clc1ccccc1Cl due to the additional chlorine and the biphenyl structure, but less complex than the highly chlorinated example with a property value of 3.71564671.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would likely be between these two examples, but closer to the higher end due to the increased number of chlorine atoms and the biphenyl structure. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 2.5.

True Property: -0.14374246343703334
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Simple aromatic compounds with alkyl groups tend to have property values around -0.5 to 0.5.
- The presence of additional functional groups or heteroatoms tends to increase the property value.

For example:
- Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) has a property value of -0.4684215.
- Cc1ccccc1 (toluene) would likely have a similar property value, slightly negative or close to zero.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a simple diethylbenzene, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be in the range of simple alkylbenzenes, likely slightly negative or close to zero.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is approximately -0.5.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O consists of a benzene ring with a sulfonamide group attached. In the examples, aromatic compounds with nitro groups, such as Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, have property values around -0.4. The presence of the sulfonamide group, which is somewhat similar in electron-withdrawing nature to a nitro group, suggests that the property value might be in a similar range.

Considering the examples and the structural similarities, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be approximately -0.4. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is:

-0.4

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: 1.3795052979385958
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically triphenylene. It consists of four fused benzene rings, which is similar to the example c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54, which is a larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a property value of 3.87968159.

Triphenylene is smaller than the example with a property value of 3.87968159, but it is still a large, planar, and aromatic system. Based on the trend that larger and more complex aromatic systems tend to have higher property values, we can predict that the property value for triphenylene will be somewhat lower than 3.87968159 but still relatively high compared to simpler aromatic compounds.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of triphenylene (c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34) would be around 3.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the more complex aromatic structures in the examples, particularly those with multiple aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with multiple aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups, such as ketones and ethers, tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 has a property value of 4.30385376, and COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a property value of 4.33979345.

Given the structural complexity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone, the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 is likely to be in a similar range to these examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 4.3.

True Property: -0.2674180377831445
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)O)
- An amide linkage (NC(C)=O)
- A thioether linkage (SC)

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, have relatively high property values (1.58955584). However, the presence of additional electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups or multiple halogens tends to increase the property value significantly, as seen in other examples.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC lacks such strong electron-withdrawing groups, and the presence of an amide linkage, which is generally less polarizing than nitro or multiple halogens, suggests a more moderate property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is likely to be positive but not as high as those with multiple halogens or nitro groups. A reasonable estimate, based on the structural features and comparison with similar molecules, would be around 1.0.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.7813383733921172
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a simple, small molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. In the examples, simpler molecules with halogen atoms and double bonds tend to have negative property values. For instance, molecules like CCC=O and CCBr have negative values, indicating that simpler, less complex molecules with halogens and double bonds tend to have lower property values.

Given this pattern, we can predict that Cl\C=C/Cl will also have a negative property value. Considering the simplicity and the presence of two chlorine atoms, a reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.5. Therefore, the predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl is approximately -0.5.

True Property: -0.7243663347630196
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and their properties. Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle similar to benzene but with a nitrogen atom replacing one of the carbon atoms in the ring. 

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as pyridine derivatives, tend to have property values around the range of -0.3 to 0.5. For instance, the compound c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 has a property value of 0.46553543, which is a tricyclic aromatic compound with nitrogen atoms.

Considering pyridine's structure and comparing it to similar aromatic compounds in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccncc1 would be around 0.1. This value reflects its aromatic nature and the presence of a nitrogen atom, which slightly increases the property value compared to benzene.

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 7.531853275614549
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has several key features:
1. An aromatic ring system, which is common in several examples with positive property values.
2. An amide linkage (O=C-N), which is present in molecules with both positive and negative values, but often contributes to a positive value when combined with aromatic systems.
3. A chloro-substituted aromatic ring, which is seen in examples with both positive and negative values, but often contributes to a slightly negative or neutral value.
4. An ether linkage (O-C-O), which is present in some examples with negative values.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule has a complex structure with both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, as well as aromatic systems that can contribute to a positive property value. However, the presence of the chloro-substituted aromatic ring and the ether linkage may slightly reduce the overall positive contribution.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 would be around 0.5.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.6797729905196904
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a terminal hydroxyl group, making it a primary alcohol (1-pentanol).

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Linear alkanes and simple alcohols tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCCCCC (hexane) has a property value of -0.18894177, and OC1CCCCCCC1 (cycloheptanol) has a property value of -0.3879887.
- The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) in alcohols generally results in a slightly more negative property value compared to alkanes of similar size.

Considering these observations, CCCCCO (1-pentanol) is expected to have a property value similar to other simple alcohols and alkanes, likely slightly more negative than hexane due to the presence of the hydroxyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO is approximately -0.25.

True Property: 1.2944570407007114
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a sulfonamide with a cyclic structure, containing a benzene ring, a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), and an amide linkage (C(=O)N). The presence of these functional groups can influence the property value.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with sulfonyl groups, such as CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C, tend to have higher property values.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC, have property values around -0.16385983.
- Aromatic rings, like in Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2, can contribute to positive property values.

Considering these factors, the presence of the sulfonyl group and the amide linkage in the given molecule suggests a property value that is likely positive but not extremely high, as the sulfonyl group can increase the value, while the amide linkage and aromatic ring can moderate it.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be around 0.5.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:
- An ester group (COC(=O))
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring
- A bicyclic structure with a nitrogen atom in the ring
- Aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as "Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O" (-0.40311083) and "CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O" (2.47785658), tend to have a range of property values, but the presence of additional functional groups and the overall structure significantly influence the property.
- Molecules with ester groups, such as "CCCCCC(=O)OC" (-0.57290615), tend to have negative property values, but again, the overall structure and additional groups can alter this.
- Aromatic rings and complex structures, such as "CCN2c1nc(N(C)(CCO))ccc1NC(=O)c3cccnc23" (4.63564067), can lead to higher property values, especially when combined with other functional groups.

Considering these observations, the molecule in question has a combination of features that could lead to a moderately positive property value due to the presence of the nitro group, ester groups, and the complex bicyclic structure. However, the specific arrangement and the presence of multiple functional groups suggest a property value that is not extremely high.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two amide groups and a cyclohexane-like structure due to the cyclization of the peptide bond. This structure is relatively small and lacks extensive aromatic systems or halogen substitutions, which are often associated with higher property values in the examples.

Looking at the examples, smaller and less complex molecules with fewer aromatic rings and halogen atoms tend to have lower property values, often negative. For instance, simple aliphatic or small cyclic structures like C1CCCCC1 have negative values.

Given the structure of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, which is a small, non-aromatic cyclic compound with no halogen atoms, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is negative and similar to other small cyclic or aliphatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.5.

The presence of a chlorine atom in ClCC is similar to Clc1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.57502238.

Considering the simplicity and the presence of a chlorine atom, the property value for ClCC is likely to be negative and similar to other small, simple molecules with halogen atoms. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be around -0.6.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a pyridine ring and a trichloromethyl group attached.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values, as seen in Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (1.23705382) and Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2 (0.45555388).
- The presence of multiple chlorine atoms, especially in a trichloromethyl group, tends to increase the property value, as seen in Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (3.71564671).

Considering these observations, the presence of a pyridine ring (which is similar to benzene but with a nitrogen atom) might slightly reduce the property value compared to a fully chlorinated benzene ring. However, the trichloromethyl group is likely to have a significant positive impact.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl would be around 1.5.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Linear alkanes and simple alcohols tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCCCCCCCl (a linear alkane with a chlorine) has a property value of -0.35141935, and CCC(CC)CO (a branched alcohol) has a property value of -0.58196595.
- The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) in alcohols generally results in a negative property value, as seen in CCC(CC)CO and CCC(C)CCO.

Given these observations, the molecule CCCCC(C)O, being a simple alcohol with a similar structure to CCC(CC)CO, is likely to have a property value in the negative range, close to those of similar alcohols.

   - ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 has a property value of 2.88212557.
   - Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O has a property value of 3.46458368.

2. Simple halogenated compounds, especially those with multiple halogens, tend to have negative property values:
   - ClCCl has a property value of -0.84322132.
   - ClC(Cl)Cl has a property value of -0.77338642.
   - ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl has a property value of -0.5859375.

3. The presence of bromine, which is less electronegative than chlorine, might slightly increase the property value compared to similar chlorinated compounds.

Considering these observations, 1,4-dibromobenzene is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero, given its aromatic nature and the presence of two bromine atoms.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately -0.5.

The example molecule is a highly chlorinated biphenyl with a high property value, likely due to the extensive chlorination. The molecule we are predicting has fewer chlorine atoms, which suggests a lower property value compared to the example.

Considering the structural similarity and the number of chlorine atoms, I would predict a property value slightly lower than 8.28247404. A reasonable estimate for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be around 6.5.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a triaryl phosphate ester, which includes:
- Three aromatic rings (phenyl groups), two of which are substituted with a methyl group.
- A phosphate group (P=O) with two ester linkages to the aromatic rings.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like carbonyls or phosphates) tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of methyl groups on aromatic rings can slightly increase the property value compared to unsubstituted rings.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is higher than simple hydrocarbons or small aliphatic compounds but lower than highly functionalized or larger aromatic systems with multiple electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1 would be around 3.5 to 4.5. Given the complexity and the presence of the phosphate group, I would estimate the property value to be approximately:

To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to increase lipophilicity and potentially increase the property value.
- An aromatic ring, which is common in many of the examples and can contribute to a moderate property value.
- A piperidine-like ring with two chlorine atoms and a carbonyl group, which can also increase the property value due to the presence of halogens and the carbonyl group.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with multiple halogens, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, have high property values (e.g., 4.09354361).
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens, such as COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, also have high property values (e.g., 4.33979345).

Given these considerations, the presence of the trifluoromethyl group, aromatic ring, and multiple halogens suggests a relatively high property value. Therefore, I predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O to be approximately 3.5.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.34590806519250217
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (CO) attached to a benzene ring, with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) also attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitro groups tend to have positive property values, as seen with the molecule O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of -0.34255893. However, the presence of additional electron-withdrawing groups, such as multiple nitro groups, can increase the property value further.

In this case, the methoxy group is an electron-donating group, which might slightly reduce the overall electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group compared to a compound with multiple nitro groups. Therefore, the property value is likely to be slightly positive but not as high as compounds with multiple nitro groups or other strongly electron-withdrawing groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around 0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 0.51781715. The given molecule has even more chlorine atoms and a more complex structure, which could potentially increase the property value due to increased molecular weight and potential for interactions.

Considering the trend that more complex and heavily halogenated molecules tend to have higher property values, I would predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is slightly higher than 0.51781715.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 0.6.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.7577096654143074
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. Esters generally have moderate to low polarity and are often less polar than alcohols or acids.

Looking at the examples, we can find some similar structures:

1. CCCCCC#C, with a property value of -0.64421991, is a linear alkyne with a similar carbon chain length.
2. CCC#C, with a property value of -0.80751915, is a shorter alkyne.
3. CCCCCCCC=C, with a property value of -0.01524415, is a longer alkene.

The presence of the ester functional group (COC=O) in CCCOC=O suggests it might have a slightly different property value compared to simple hydrocarbons or alkynes. Esters are generally less polar than alcohols but more polar than alkanes.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCOC=O is likely to be slightly negative, reflecting its moderate polarity. Based on the examples and the nature of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be around -0.3.

True Property: 0.6128702310454686
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a long-chain ester, specifically a decanoate ester, which is similar to other aliphatic esters and long-chain hydrocarbons in the examples.

From the examples, we observe that long-chain hydrocarbons and esters tend to have property values around the range of -0.3 to 0.3. For instance, CCCCC(CC)C=O has a property value of -0.35494643, and CCCCCCc1ccccc1 has a property value of 0.29780306. These examples suggest that the property value for long-chain aliphatic compounds is slightly negative to slightly positive.

Given the structure of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, which is a decanoate ester, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately -0.35.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and functional groups present in the molecule and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have negative property values.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, also tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of chlorine atoms in aromatic rings, as seen in several examples, does not significantly alter the trend towards negative values.

Considering these observations, the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of the nitro group and the amide linkage, both of which are associated with negative values in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.4, considering the influence of the functional groups and the overall structure.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are similar to the phosphorothioate group in the example molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 5.98725652. The presence of these groups suggests a potentially high property value due to their electron-withdrawing nature and the overall complexity of the molecule.

Additionally, the molecule has two aromatic rings connected by a sulfur atom, which is a feature that can contribute to a higher property value, as seen in other complex aromatic systems with high property values.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, the predicted property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 is likely to be high. A reasonable estimate, based on the structural complexity and comparison with similar molecules, would be around 6.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.40311083. Additionally, molecules with phenol groups, such as Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, have a property value of -0.46076979. The presence of both a nitro group and a phenol group in the same molecule suggests that the property value might be influenced by both functional groups.

Considering the examples and the structural similarities, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be around -0.4 to -0.5. Given the specific example of Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which is a nitrobenzene derivative, a closer prediction would be:

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. This molecule is a complex sugar, likely a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide, given the multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic acetal structures.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic structures, such as sugars, tend to have negative property values. For instance, C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O has a property value of -0.60900007. The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups generally contributes to a lower property value due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding potential.

Considering the complexity and the number of hydroxyl groups in the given molecule, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is negative and possibly lower than -0.60900007 due to the increased number of hydroxyl groups and the larger size of the molecule.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O would be approximately -0.8.

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne with a terminal triple bond, also known as 1-butyne. It is a relatively small and simple hydrocarbon. In the examples, small hydrocarbons and simple structures tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCC(C)C(=O)C has a property value of -0.60547449, and CCC(C)OC=O has a property value of -0.75807551.

Given the simplicity and size of CCC#C, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and likely in a similar range to these small hydrocarbons.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C is approximately -0.6.

The presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a higher property value, while the chlorinated aromatic ring suggests a moderate to high property value. Considering these factors and the examples provided, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be around 3.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a pyridine derivative with a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a hydrazine moiety (NN).

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like carbonyls) tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of nitrogen in heterocycles (like pyridine) can also contribute to a positive property value, as seen in examples like c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 (0.46553543) and Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2 (-0.36929352).

Considering these observations, the presence of the pyridine ring and the carbonyl group attached to a hydrazine moiety suggests a property value that is likely slightly positive, but not as high as those with multiple aromatic rings or additional electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be around 0.1.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule contains several functional groups and structural elements that can influence its property value:

1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S)(O)S)**: This group is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, which has a property value of 1.22356955. The presence of this group suggests a potential for a positive contribution to the property value.

2. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: The presence of an amide group is seen in several molecules with varying property values. For instance, CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C has a negative property value of -0.54292225, while CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1 has a positive value of 1.85013116. The context and surrounding groups can significantly influence the impact of the amide group.

3. **Cyclohexyl Group (N1CCCCC1)**: This group is part of a piperidine ring, which can contribute to the overall property value. The presence of cyclic structures often correlates with positive property values, as seen in several examples.

4. **Alkyl Chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)**: These are common in many molecules with both positive and negative property values. Their influence is often neutral or slightly negative unless they are part of a larger, more complex structure.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C likely has a property value that is positive but not extremely high. The presence of the phosphorothioate group and the cyclic amide structure suggests a positive contribution, while the alkyl chains may have a neutral or slightly negative effect.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is approximately **1.5**.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.36521526208882904
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC, we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The examples suggest that linear alkanes and simple alcohols tend to have negative property values, with the magnitude of the value generally decreasing (becoming less negative) as the chain length increases.

For instance:
- CCCCCC (hexane) has a property value of -0.46132185.
- CCCCC (pentane) has a property value of -0.43403891.

Given that CCCCCCCC (octane) is a longer alkane than hexane, we can expect its property value to be slightly less negative than that of hexane. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC would be around -0.4. 

Thus, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCC is approximately -0.4.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group and a triple bond. It resembles some of the more complex structures in the examples, such as CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO, which has a high property value of 7.56294397, and CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 3.2930014.

The presence of the hydroxyl group and the triple bond in the molecule could influence the property value. The hydroxyl group generally increases polarity, while the triple bond might contribute to rigidity and electronic effects.

Considering the complexity and the presence of functional groups, the property value is likely to be higher than simpler cyclic structures but lower than the most complex example provided. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C would be around 3.5 to 4.0.

Given these considerations, I would predict the property value to be approximately 3.8.

The molecule in question, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, appears to be a large and complex structure with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and hydroxyl groups. It resembles some of the larger, more complex molecules in the examples, which tend to have higher property values.

Given the presence of multiple aromatic systems, ether linkages, and hydroxyl groups, which can contribute to increased molecular interactions and complexity, I would predict a relatively high property value.

- Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O: -0.49119788
- Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O: -0.49119788

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is a phenol with a chlorine substituent. The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) typically contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in the examples with nitrophenols. The presence of chlorine, as seen in chlorobenzene derivatives, can have varying effects depending on the structure.

Given the examples, the presence of the hydroxyl group in phenols tends to lower the property value, while the chlorine substituent can have a slightly positive or neutral effect. Considering these factors, the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is likely to be slightly negative, similar to the chlorobenzene example but influenced by the hydroxyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around -0.3.

- The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) in conjunction with aromatic rings can also contribute to positive property values.
- Molecules with multiple halogen atoms, particularly chlorine, tend to have higher property values.

Given these observations, the presence of two chlorine atoms, an aromatic ring, and carbonyl groups in the molecule suggests a positive property value. Comparing with similar structures in the examples, such as Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (4.09354361) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (3.15946739), we can infer that the property value for ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 is likely to be positive but not as high as those with multiple chlorines on the aromatic ring.

- The presence of heterocycles like pyrimidine can also influence the property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule has multiple aromatic rings, two chlorine substituents, and a pyrimidine ring, which suggests a relatively high property value. Comparing with similar structures in the examples, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (3.71564671) and ClC(Cl)=C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 (2.94441491), we can estimate a property value in a similar range.

The molecule CCCCCOC=O is similar to CCCCC(=O)OCC, but with one less carbon in the chain and an ester group. The presence of the ester group and the length of the carbon chain suggest that the property value might be slightly negative, similar to the other linear chain molecules with carbonyl or ester groups.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be around -0.6. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

- ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(NC=O)N1C=CN(C=C1)C(NC=O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (a more complex chlorinated compound) with a property value of 4.42470852

Given that ClCCl is a smaller and simpler molecule than ClCCCl, it is reasonable to expect that its property value would be similar or slightly more negative due to its smaller size and lower complexity.

From the examples, we can identify similar structures and their properties:

1. CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, -0.07106284: This is a methylated phenol similar to p-cresol, with an additional methyl group.
2. Oc1cccc(O)c1, -0.61363494: This is a dihydroxybenzene, which is more polar due to the additional hydroxyl group.
3. c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC, 0.50276161: This is a more complex structure with multiple hydroxyl groups and an alkyl chain, leading to a positive property value.

Considering the structure of Cc1cccc(C)c1O, it is less complex than the third example and more similar to the first example, but with only one hydroxyl group. The presence of the hydroxyl group will contribute to a slightly negative property value due to its polar nature, but the overall structure is relatively simple.

Based on these comparisons, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be slightly negative, similar to the first example. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately -0.1.

The first example, Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl, has a property value of 2.39065878. The second example, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl, has a property value of 3.15946739. Both of these molecules have multiple chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings, which increases the property value compared to non-halogenated aromatic compounds.

The target molecule, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, has four chlorine atoms, similar to the second example, but with a slightly different arrangement. Given the structural similarity and the number of chlorine atoms, we can predict that the property value will be closer to the second example.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is approximately 3.0.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.7085354940042888
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple hydrocarbon with a branched structure and a double bond.

Looking at the examples, we can see that simple hydrocarbons with linear or branched structures, such as CCCCCCCC (octane) and CCCCCCCC=C (nonene), have property values around -0.36521526 and -0.01524415, respectively. These values are slightly negative, indicating that simple hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values.

Given that isoprene is a small, branched hydrocarbon with a double bond, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be slightly negative, similar to the other simple hydrocarbons in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C (isoprene) would be around -0.1.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.8432213236303933
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the degree of unsaturation or aromaticity.

Dichloromethane is a small, simple molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a central carbon. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl and Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, tend to have negative property values, likely due to the electron-withdrawing nature of chlorine, which can affect the overall electronic properties of the molecule.

Given this trend and the simplicity of dichloromethane compared to the more complex chlorinated compounds in the examples, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for ClCCl. Considering the examples with similar characteristics, a predicted property value for ClCCl would be approximately -0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

In the examples, we have a similar molecule: Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which is 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, with a property value of -0.22396212. Given the structural similarity, we can reasonably predict that the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl will be very close to this value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is approximately -0.22396212.

True Property: 37.72919578814975
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known molecules.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and hydroxyl groups. It shares some structural similarities with the more complex molecules in the examples, such as those with multiple rings and oxygen-containing functional groups.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple aromatic and heterocyclic rings, as well as the presence of oxygen atoms which can contribute to polarity and potential hydrogen bonding, the property value is likely to be on the higher end of the scale, similar to other complex polycyclic structures in the examples.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 5.0.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.45781361925295244
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thioether group (CS), a pyrazole ring (1,2,4-triazole-like structure), a carbonyl group (C=O), and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). 

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar heterocyclic structures and functional groups tend to have positive property values. For instance:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a property value of 1.07447582.
- CCC(C)C1(CC(Br)=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O has a property value of 1.17619162.

Both examples have heterocyclic structures with carbonyl groups and bulky substituents, similar to the molecule in question. Given these similarities, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C will also be positive and in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is approximately 1.1.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.25116818966184806
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is an ester, specifically ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ethyl group (CCO) attached to a benzoate group (c1ccccc1C(=O)O).

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 with a property value of 5.99339237. This molecule is more complex due to the presence of additional functional groups like sulfonamide and a heterocyclic ring.
- CCCCCC(=O)OC with a property value of -0.45244959. This is a simple ester with a longer alkyl chain.
- CCCCC(=O)OCC with a property value of -0.45244959. This is another simple ester with a similar structure to the target molecule but with a longer alkyl chain.

The target molecule, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, is simpler than the first example and more similar to the last two examples, which are simple esters. Given the similarity in structure to CCCCC(=O)OCC, it is reasonable to predict a similar property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.45244959.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.24553933275405307
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, aromatic rings, and halogens.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached. In the examples, linear alkyl chains such as CCCCCCCCO have a property value of -0.46132185, and Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which is an aromatic compound with a bromine atom, has a property value of 0.15313096. The presence of a bromine atom in an aromatic compound seems to slightly increase the property value compared to similar structures without bromine.

Given that CCCCCCCBr is a simple alkyl chain with a bromine atom, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be slightly higher than that of a similar alkyl chain without bromine, but not as high as aromatic compounds with bromine.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be slightly above the value for CCCCCCCCO, which is -0.46132185. Considering the influence of the bromine atom, a predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr could be around -0.4.
