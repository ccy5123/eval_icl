SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.7529380065585458
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxo group and a nitrogen atom. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings and heteroatoms.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with aromatic rings and heteroatoms, such as c1cncnc1 (0.47317726) and Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C (1.98121791), tend to have positive property values. However, the presence of chlorine atoms often correlates with a property value of 0.0, as seen in ClC=C, ClCCBr, and ClCC.

Considering these observations, the presence of the chlorine atom in Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 might suggest a property value closer to 0.0. However, the heterocyclic structure with an oxo group and nitrogen could contribute to a slightly positive value.

Balancing these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around 0.47317726, similar to other heterocyclic aromatic compounds with nitrogen.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an isopropyl group (CC(C)). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have relatively high property values (2.1858011). This suggests that the presence of a nitro group contributes significantly to the property value.

Considering the examples and the structural features of CC(C)N(=O)=O, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be relatively high due to the presence of the nitro group. Therefore, a predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O could be around 2.1858011, similar to the example with a nitro group.

- CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C, which has a property value of 2.04441581.

The presence of multiple rings and carbonyl groups suggests that the property value might be relatively high, similar to the example above. Given the structural similarities, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 2.04441581. However, considering potential differences in the exact arrangement and additional functional groups, a slightly adjusted prediction could be:

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 2.1082515348128177
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A fluorinated benzene ring (Fc1cccc(F)c1), which is similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of 0.0.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N), which is present in several molecules with varying property values.
- A chlorinated benzene ring (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), which is similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which also has a property value of 0.0.

The presence of both fluorine and chlorine substituents on aromatic rings, along with the amide linkage, suggests a potential for a non-zero property value. However, the examples with similar halogenated aromatic structures and amide linkages often have property values close to zero or slightly positive.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be close to zero, but slightly positive due to the amide linkage. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.58904123, similar to COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which also contains an amide linkage and a chlorinated aromatic ring.

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 2.1045595084625406
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and structural features. For instance, molecules with simple alkane or alkene structures, or those with halogen atoms, often have a property value of 0.0. Molecules with alcohol groups, carbonyl groups, or more complex aromatic systems tend to have non-zero values, either positive or negative.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with an alkyl chain. In the examples, simple ethers and alkanes like CCC1(CCC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2 and CCCCO have negative property values, often around -0.83939914. Given this pattern, it is reasonable to predict that CCCOC(C)C will also have a similar negative property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is -0.83939914.

True Property: 1.9812179053932972
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with halogens like Cl or Br often have a property value of 0.0, especially when they are simple aromatic compounds or alkanes.
2. The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) tends to increase the property value, as seen in several examples.
3. The presence of heteroatoms like nitrogen in a ring structure can also influence the property value, often increasing it.

Given these observations, the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O has a combination of features that suggest a non-zero property value. The presence of the bromine atom might suggest a lower value, but the two carbonyl groups and the nitrogen in the ring are likely to increase it.

Comparing with similar structures in the examples, such as OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O (1.19172506) and CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (1.67064852), the property value for the given molecule is likely to be in a similar range.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the property value is related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups or structural features. The molecule in question, c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, is biphenyl, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond.

In the examples, molecules that are purely hydrocarbon structures, such as aromatic hydrocarbons without additional functional groups, tend to have a property value of 0.0. For instance, the molecules Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 and c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 both have a property value of 0.0, and they are composed entirely of aromatic rings.

Given that biphenyl is also a purely aromatic hydrocarbon without any additional functional groups, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be 0.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 is 0.0.
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property value is influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and structural features. Aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as those with only carbon and hydrogen atoms, tend to have a property value of 0.0. The presence of heteroatoms like oxygen, nitrogen, or sulfur, as well as specific functional groups, can lead to non-zero property values.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear aliphatic chain with a terminal sulfur atom. In the examples, simple aliphatic chains without additional functional groups or heteroatoms (e.g., CCCC(=C)C, CCC1CCCCC1, CCCCCCC=C) have a property value of 0.0. However, the presence of a sulfur atom at the end of the chain in CCCCCS might slightly alter this value.

Considering the examples and the potential influence of the sulfur atom, I would predict a property value close to 0.0, but slightly different due to the sulfur. A reasonable prediction could be a small positive or negative value, but without more specific examples involving sulfur, it is challenging to be precise.

Therefore, I predict the property value for CCCCCS to be approximately 0.0.

Additionally, molecules with halogens like "ClCC(Cl)Cl" and "BrC(Br)Br" also have a property value of 0.0.

The molecule "CCCC(C)(C)CO" is a simple alcohol with a branched alkane structure. The presence of the alcohol group (OH) might suggest a deviation from 0.0, but given the examples, it seems that simple alcohols and alkanes tend to have a property value of 0.0, as seen with "CCCC(C)(O)CC" which has a value of -0.83939914, indicating that the presence of an alcohol group in a simple alkane structure might lead to a negative value.

Therefore, based on the pattern observed, the predicted property value for "CCCC(C)(C)CO" is likely to be similar to other simple alcohols and alkanes, which is -0.83939914.

True Property: 0.6631256504385672
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic urea, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of 0.66312565. The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the given molecule, which could potentially affect the property value.

Considering the examples, the addition of alkyl chains generally tends to decrease the property value, as seen in several examples where the addition of alkyl groups results in negative property values. However, the cyclic urea core structure tends to have a positive influence on the property value.

Taking these factors into account, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is likely to be slightly lower than 0.66312565 due to the additional alkyl chain. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.5.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached. In the examples, aromatic compounds with halogen substituents, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1 and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, have a property value of 0.0. These examples suggest that aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have a property value of 0.0.

Given that trifluoromethyl is a halogen-like substituent and the molecule is an aromatic compound, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is 0.0.

This molecule contains several notable features:

1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O):** The presence of nitro groups is significant as they often contribute to the electronic properties of the molecule. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have positive property values.

2. **Trifluoromethyl Group (C(F)(F)F):** The trifluoromethyl group is highly electronegative and can influence the molecule's electronic properties. In the examples, molecules with fluorine, such as CC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O)C(=O)COC(C)=O, have positive property values.

4. **Alkyl Chain with a Double Bond (CC(C)=C):** This feature is less likely to significantly impact the property value compared to the nitro and trifluoromethyl groups.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule has multiple electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and trifluoromethyl), which tend to increase the property value. The presence of these groups suggests that the property value is likely to be positive and relatively high.

Based on the analysis and comparison with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 1.5. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is:

Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule. The molecule in question, CC(C)OC=O, is an ester with a simple structure.

The presence of the ester group (OC=O) in the molecule CCC(C)C1(CC=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O, which has a property value of 0.66312565, suggests that the ester group contributes positively to the property value.

Given the simplicity of the molecule CC(C)OC=O compared to the more complex structures with similar functional groups, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is closer to the lower end of the range for esters. Therefore, I would predict the property value for CC(C)OC=O to be approximately 0.67449076, similar to other simple esters in the examples.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.8393991440337654
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the structures in the examples.

Looking at the examples, we see that simple aromatic compounds with hydroxyl groups, such as phenol derivatives, tend to have negative property values. For instance, c1ccccc1O (phenol) has a property value of -0.83939914. The presence of additional methyl groups, as in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, might slightly alter this value, but not drastically.

Given this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be slightly less negative than -0.83939914, due to the additional methyl group. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.7.

True Property: 1.2028568322453446
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has a thiophosphate group (COP(=S)(OC)O-) attached to a benzene ring with a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) as substituents. This structure is somewhat similar to the examples with thiophosphate groups and halogenated benzene rings, such as:

- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, with a property value of 1.20285683
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, with a property value of 1.20285683
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, with a property value of 1.20285683

These examples have consistent property values, suggesting that the presence of the thiophosphate group and the substitution pattern on the benzene ring significantly influence the property value.

Given the structural similarity, particularly the presence of the thiophosphate group and the substitution pattern on the benzene ring, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 will be similar to those examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is approximately 1.20285683.

True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and structural features. The molecule in question, Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is a chlorinated aromatic compound with multiple chlorine atoms attached to the aromatic rings.

In the examples, similar highly chlorinated aromatic compounds, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, have a property value of 0.0. This suggests that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings tends to result in a property value of 0.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is 0.0.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7237793359215606
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to the end. 

In the examples, molecules with simple aliphatic chains, such as CCC (0.0) and CCCCCCC (0.0), have a property value of 0.0. However, the presence of a nitro group can significantly affect the property value. For instance, the molecule O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O has a high property value of 2.13867221, indicating that nitro groups can increase the property value.

Considering the structure of CCCN(=O)=O, it is a small molecule with a single nitro group. The presence of the nitro group suggests that the property value will be positive, but not as high as molecules with multiple nitro groups or more complex aromatic systems.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 0.5.

For instance, Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 and c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12 both have a property value of 0.0.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, similar in structure to the examples mentioned. Based on this pattern, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is 0.0.

True Property: -0.8393991440337654
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with a hydroxyl group, which is similar to some of the cyclic structures in the examples.

Looking at the examples, we notice that cyclic structures with alcohol groups, such as CCC1(CCC(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O, have a property value of 0.66312565. However, this example also contains additional functional groups like amides, which can influence the property value.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is simpler, with fewer functional groups, and is more similar to the example CC1CCCO1, which has a property value of 2.10455951. However, the presence of the hydroxyl group in our target molecule might slightly lower the property value compared to a simple ether or alkane.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is likely to be closer to the lower end of the range for cyclic alcohols, but still positive due to the bicyclic structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is approximately 1.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), an amide linkage, and a phenyl ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 2.13034186. The main difference is the presence of a thioether linkage (SC) and a chloro group (CCl) in the example, which are absent in the molecule we are analyzing.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage, we can expect the property value to be in a similar range, but potentially slightly lower due to the absence of the thioether and chloro group, which might contribute to a higher property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be slightly lower than 2.13034186. A predicted value could be around 2.0.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of 1.89591301. Both molecules contain a benzene ring and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle with a carbonyl group.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of aromatic rings and nitrogen heterocycles, the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is likely to be in a similar range. Therefore, I would predict the property value to be approximately 1.9.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can look for similar structures in the examples provided and their corresponding property values. The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is methyl benzoate, which is an ester of benzoic acid.

In the examples, we have the following similar structures:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 with a property value of -0.67137672
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 with a property value of 0.67449076

The structure COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is more similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, as both are esters of benzoic acid with a methoxy group. Given this similarity, the property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is likely to be close to that of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately 0.67449076.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a simple linear diene (1,3-butadiene), which is similar in complexity to other hydrocarbons like CCC(C)(C)CC and C=Cc1ccccc1, both of which have a property value of 0.0. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for C=CCC=C is 0.0.

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some aspect of the molecule's electronic, steric, or solubility characteristics.

The molecule "BrC(Br)Br" is a simple, highly halogenated compound (tribromomethane or bromoform). Given the pattern observed in the examples, where highly halogenated compounds tend to have a property value of 0.0, it is reasonable to predict that "BrC(Br)Br" would also have a property value of 0.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 0.58904123.
- A thioester linkage (SC(CCl)), which is not directly present in the examples but is part of the overall structure.

Considering these structural features and their presence in the examples, the molecule likely has a property value influenced by the phosphorothioate group and the bicyclic lactam structure. The presence of chlorine and the thioester linkage may also contribute to the property value.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 1.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

- A tertiary amide group (CN(C)C(=O)N).
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)).
- A heterocyclic moiety (n2nc(oc2=O)).
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C).

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens (Cl) often have property values around 0.0.
- Molecules with complex heterocycles and additional functional groups can have positive property values.

The molecule in question has a combination of these features, including a complex heterocycle and a tert-butyl group, which might contribute to a positive property value. However, the presence of the chlorinated aromatic ring and the amide group might moderate this effect.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be around 0.5.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which has two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with chlorine substituents on each ring. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, have a property value of -0.83939914. This suggests that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms tends to result in a negative property value.

Additionally, the presence of an ether linkage (as in the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl) does not significantly alter the property value compared to similar chlorinated aromatic compounds without the ether linkage.

Based on these observations, the predicted property value for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is likely to be similar to other chlorinated aromatic compounds, which is -0.83939914.

The molecule "CC/C=C\C" is a linear alkene with no additional functional groups or heteroatoms. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons and molecules without significant functional groups or heteroatoms tend to have a property value of 0.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a tertiary amide with two phenyl rings and a tert-butyl group. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings and amide linkages. For instance, the molecule CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 has a property value of -0.59551706, and it also contains an amide linkage and aromatic rings.

Additionally, the molecule Nc1cccc2ccccc12 has a property value of 0.56586262, and it features aromatic rings without an amide linkage. The presence of the tert-butyl group in the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 may influence the property value, as seen in other examples with bulky groups.

Considering these comparisons, the predicted property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be in the range of the examples with aromatic rings and amide linkages, possibly slightly positive due to the influence of the tert-butyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is approximately 0.5.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains an acetamide group (CC(=O)N) attached to a bromobenzene ring (c1ccc(Br)cc1). In the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents, such as Fc1cccc(Br)c1 and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1, have a property value of 0.0. Additionally, molecules with acetamide groups, such as CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, have a property value close to zero, specifically -0.83864314.

Considering these observations, the presence of both an acetamide group and a bromobenzene ring suggests that the property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to be close to zero. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is 0.0.

The molecule in question, CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, is isopropylbenzene, also known as cumene. 

Looking at the examples, molecules with a benzene ring and simple alkyl groups, such as CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethylbenzene) and CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (isopropylbenzene), have a property value of 0.0. This suggests that the presence of a benzene ring with alkyl substituents tends to result in a property value of 0.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is 0.0.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.3843269010954972
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Simple aromatic hydrocarbons like benzene derivatives (e.g., c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45) tend to have a property value of 0.0.
2. Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups such as nitro groups (e.g., O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O) tend to have positive property values.
3. Molecules with electron-donating groups or less polar functional groups (e.g., CC(C)(C)Cc1ccccc1) tend to have a property value of 0.0.

Benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which is a moderately electron-withdrawing group, but not as strongly as nitro groups. Based on the examples, it is reasonable to predict that benzaldehyde will have a property value that is slightly positive, but not as high as those with strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) would be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring, similar to some of the examples. The presence of the nitro group (N(=O)=O) and the heterocyclic structure (a lactam ring) can influence the property value.

From the examples, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings, such as Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2, have a property value of 1.26789948. However, the presence of additional functional groups and the overall molecular structure can affect this value.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of the nitro group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be around 1.0. This accounts for the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group and the aromatic system, which are common features in the examples with positive property values.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule is approximately 1.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings, such as biphenyl structures, tend to have property values around 0.0.
- The presence of nitrogen atoms in aromatic systems, such as in N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 0.07764202, suggests a slight deviation from 0.0.

Given these observations, the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, but with a different nitrogen configuration. The presence of the hydrazine group might slightly influence the property value, but it is likely to remain close to the value of the similar structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be approximately 0.07764202, similar to the related example.

The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. This structure is similar to the example O=C1N(COC(=O)CC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 0.83367893. Both molecules contain a cyclic amide structure, but the example molecule has additional aromatic rings, which can influence the property value.

Considering the cyclic nature and the presence of amide groups, the property value is likely to be positive but not as high as the example with aromatic rings. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 would be around 0.6.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

In the examples, we have:

- Cc1ccccc1N, which is aniline, with a property value of 0.56586262.
- CCc1ccccn1, which is ethylpyridine, with a property value of 1.11836185.

Both of these molecules have aromatic rings with alkyl or similar substituents. The presence of alkyl groups generally increases the property value compared to the unsubstituted benzene ring, which is consistent with the examples.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is similar to these examples, particularly to ethylpyridine, but without the nitrogen atom, we can expect the property value to be somewhat similar but likely lower than 1.11836185 due to the absence of the nitrogen atom, which can contribute to a higher property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be around 0.8.

Given the structural similarity and the electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O will be close to that of the nitro-substituted aniline.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is approximately -0.83953899.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the structures in the examples, particularly those with multiple aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups.

From the examples, molecules with multiple aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups, such as ketones and hydroxyls, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5 has a property value of -0.72952965, and Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 has a property value of -0.55846778.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 will also be negative.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphoric acid ester group (P=O with OC and NC).
- A thioester linkage (SC).
- An amide group (NC(C)=O).

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with phosphoric acid esters, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, have a property value of 1.20285683.
- Molecules with amide groups, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1, have a property value of 1.67064852.
- Molecules with thioester linkages, such as CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, have a property value of 0.58904123.

Considering the presence of these functional groups and their influence on the property value, the predicted property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is likely to be influenced by the combination of these groups. The presence of the phosphoric acid ester and thioester linkage suggests a moderate positive value, while the amide group may increase it further.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is approximately 0.8.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and structural features.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a simple alkene with two chlorine atoms attached to the carbon-carbon double bond. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons and molecules with halogen substitutions often have property values around 0.0. For instance, molecules like Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl and CCBr have property values of 0.0.

Given this pattern, it is reasonable to predict that Cl\C=C/Cl, being a small molecule with halogen substitutions similar to those examples, would also have a property value of approximately 0.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl is 0.0.

Looking at the examples, aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as CNc1ccccc1 (aniline) and CNc1ccccc1 (N-methylaniline), have positive property values of 1.42428511. Additionally, heterocyclic aromatic compounds like c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 (quinoline) have a positive property value of 0.47317726.

Given that pyridine is a simple aromatic heterocycle with a nitrogen atom, it is reasonable to predict that it will also have a positive property value. Considering the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of pyridine (c1ccncc1) would be around 1.42428511, similar to other nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds.

Therefore, the predicted property value for c1ccncc1 is approximately 1.42428511.

- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2, have higher positive property values (2.18762956).
- Chlorinated aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1, often have a property value of 0.0, but in combination with other functional groups, they can contribute to a positive value.

Considering the combination of these functional groups and the examples provided, the molecule is likely to have a positive property value. The presence of the ester and amide groups, along with the aromatic systems, suggests a property value similar to other complex aromatic and amide-containing molecules.

Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some aspect of the molecule's physical or chemical properties. The examples with simple hydrocarbon chains or aromatic rings without additional functional groups tend to have a property value of 0.0. 

The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol (1-hexanol), which is a simple aliphatic chain with an alcohol group. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons like CCCCCC (hexane) and aromatic compounds like Fc1ccccc1Br (bromobenzene) have a property value of 0.0. However, the presence of an alcohol group might slightly alter this value.

Given the pattern observed, the presence of the alcohol group in CCCCCO might slightly increase the property value compared to a simple hydrocarbon chain. However, without additional complex functional groups or aromatic systems, the property value is likely to remain close to 0.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCO is approximately 0.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is often associated with polar and electron-withdrawing characteristics.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is also polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which is common in many of the examples and often associated with a property value of around 1.1 to 2.1 when combined with other polar groups.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can also contribute to polarity.

Based on the examples:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and polar groups like amides or sulfonyl groups tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of both an amide and a sulfonyl group, along with an aromatic ring, suggests a property value in the higher positive range.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be around 1.5.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several functional groups and structural features:

1. **Ester groups**: There are two ester groups (COC(=O)) in the structure, which are known to contribute to higher property values in the examples provided.
2. **Nitro group**: The presence of a nitro group (N(=O)=O) is also a significant feature. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative property values.
3. **Aromatic ring**: The molecule contains an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in many of the examples.
4. **Substituents on the aromatic ring**: The presence of substituents on the aromatic ring, such as the nitro group, can influence the property value.

Based on the examples, molecules with ester groups and aromatic rings tend to have higher property values, while the presence of a nitro group can lower the value. However, the overall structure and the combination of these features need to be considered.

Given the complexity of the molecule and the presence of both property-increasing (ester groups) and property-decreasing (nitro group) features, the predicted property value is likely to be positive but not extremely high.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 1.5.

True Property: 0.6631256504385644
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two amide groups and a cyclohexane-like structure due to the cyclization of the peptide bond. This structure is somewhat similar to other cyclic or heterocyclic compounds in the examples, such as the diketopiperazine-like structures or other cyclic amides.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with cyclic amide structures, such as OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O, have positive property values (1.19172506). However, the presence of additional aromatic rings or substituents like chlorine can influence the property value significantly.

In the case of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, the structure is relatively simple, lacking additional aromatic rings or electronegative substituents that could significantly increase the property value. Therefore, it is likely to have a property value closer to zero or slightly positive due to the presence of the amide groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around 0.0 to 0.1. However, given the lack of additional complex features, a value closer to zero is more likely.

3. The presence of a pyridine ring, as seen in c2ccc1ocnc1c2, has a property value of 0.56973588, but this is not directly comparable due to the different substituents.

Given the structure of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, it is similar to the chlorinated aromatic compounds with a property value of 0.0. The presence of the pyridine nitrogen might slightly influence the property, but the overall pattern suggests that the property value is likely to be 0.0.

Given that CCCCC(C)O is structurally similar to CCC(C)CCO and CCC(CC)CO, both of which have a property value of -0.83939914, it is reasonable to predict that CCCCC(C)O will have a similar property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCC(C)O is -0.83939914.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro or carbonyl groups) tend to have positive property values.
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and electron-donating groups (like methoxy groups) also tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of phosphate esters in the examples is not directly observed, but similar functional groups like carbonyls and esters are present in molecules with positive property values.

Given these observations, the presence of aromatic rings and the phosphate ester linkage in the molecule suggests a positive property value. The structure is somewhat similar to other molecules with positive values, such as those with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups.

Therefore, based on the structural features and comparison with the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately 1.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is often associated with increased lipophilicity and electron-withdrawing effects.
- An aromatic ring, which is common in many of the examples.
- A piperidine-like ring with two chlorine atoms and a ketone group, which introduces steric bulk and potential electron-withdrawing effects.

From the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro groups) tend to have negative property values, while those with more complex structures and additional functional groups (like ketones or amides) can have positive values.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of electron-withdrawing groups, the property value is likely to be positive but not extremely high, as seen in some of the more complex examples.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O would be around 0.8.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of 1.15861217, and it contains two nitro groups attached to a benzene ring.

Given that COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has one nitro group and one methoxy group, which is an electron-donating group, the property value might be slightly lower than that of a molecule with two nitro groups. However, the presence of the methoxy group could also contribute to a positive property value due to its electron-donating nature.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around 1.0.

The given molecule is a highly chlorinated polycyclic compound. From the examples, we can observe that molecules with high chlorine content and polycyclic structures tend to have a property value of 0.0. For instance, ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl and BrC(Br)Br both have a property value of 0.0. These examples suggest that the presence of multiple halogen atoms, especially chlorine, in a cyclic or polycyclic structure often results in a property value of 0.0.

The closest example in terms of structure and functional groups is Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of -0.72377934.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be approximately -0.72377934.

The molecule in question contains:
- Two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O).
- Aromatic rings connected by a sulfur atom (Sc2ccc...cc2).

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, have a property value of 0.58904123.
- Molecules with aromatic rings and ether linkages, such as COc1ncnc2nccnc12, have a property value of 1.50353691.

The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 is complex, with multiple aromatic rings and phosphorothioate groups, suggesting a higher property value due to the presence of these functional groups.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of multiple phosphorothioate groups, the property value is likely to be higher than 0.58904123 but potentially lower than 1.50353691, given the absence of additional features that significantly increase the property value.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include various types of organic molecules, and the property values seem to be related to some aspect of molecular structure, possibly related to polarity, solubility, or another physicochemical property.

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne. In the examples, linear alkanes and simple hydrocarbons like CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO and CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO have property values of -0.83939914. However, these are longer chains and include an alcohol group, which might influence the property value.

For smaller hydrocarbons, such as CCC(C)C(=O)C and CCC(=O)C, the property values are -0.3843269. These molecules are ketones, which might have a different property value due to the presence of the carbonyl group.

Given that CCC#C is a small, linear alkyne without additional functional groups, it is likely to have a property value closer to simple hydrocarbons. However, the presence of the triple bond might slightly alter the property value compared to alkanes.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around -0.3843269, similar to other small hydrocarbons in the examples. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCC#C is:

-0.3843269

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: -0.6954342921340326
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Presence of Chlorine (Cl) Substituents**: The molecule has three chlorine atoms attached to a benzene ring. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl, have a property value of 0.0. This suggests that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms on an aromatic ring tends to result in a property value of 0.0.

2. **Phosphorothioate Group (P=S)**: The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S). In the examples, COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of 0.58904123. This suggests that the presence of a phosphorothioate group can contribute to a positive property value, but the overall effect depends on the rest of the molecular structure.

3. **Ether Linkage (O-alkyl)**: The molecule has an ether linkage (O-alkyl) connecting the phosphorothioate group to the aromatic ring. In the examples, ether linkages do not appear to have a consistent effect on the property value, as seen in various molecules with different property values.

Considering these factors, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring is a dominant feature that often results in a property value of 0.0. However, the presence of the phosphorothioate group could slightly increase the property value, as seen in the example with a similar group.

Taking into account the structural similarities and the influence of the phosphorothioate group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl would be slightly positive, but close to 0.0 due to the dominant effect of the chlorine atoms.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule is approximately:

0.58904123

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.7725463447747488
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is a pyridine ring with a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a hydrazine moiety (NN). This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2, which has a property value of 0.92613215. Both molecules contain nitrogen heterocycles and a carbonyl group, although the specific arrangement and additional functional groups differ.

Considering the presence of the pyridine ring and the carbonyl group attached to a hydrazine, which may contribute to a similar electronic environment as the example with a high property value, we can predict that the property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 will be relatively high, but not necessarily as high as 0.92613215 due to the absence of additional nitrogen atoms in the ring.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be around 0.8.

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 0.5890412310860947
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, have a property value of -0.70510435.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, have a property value of -0.30696509.
- Molecules with piperidine rings, such as Cn2c(=O)n(C)c1ncn(CC(O)CO)c1c2=O, have a property value of 1.57417224.

Considering these structural features and their associated property values, the presence of both the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage suggests a negative contribution to the property value, while the piperidine ring might contribute positively.

Balancing these influences, the predicted property value for CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is likely to be slightly negative, but not as low as the phosphorothioate example. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately:

-0.25

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property value is related to the structure and functional groups present in the molecules. Alkanes, which are saturated hydrocarbons without any functional groups, tend to have a property value of 0.0. For instance, molecules like "C/C1CCCCC1\C" and "CCCCCC1CCCC1" have a property value of 0.0.

The molecule "CCCCCCCC" is an alkane (octane) with no functional groups or unsaturation. Therefore, following the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for "CCCCCCCC" is 0.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbonyl group (C=O), as well as an alkyne group (C#C). The presence of these functional groups can influence the property value.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with polycyclic structures and carbonyl groups, such as CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCC3CCC2C3, have positive property values (0.66312565).
- Molecules with hydroxyl groups and complex ring systems, such as OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, also have positive property values (1.30284257).
- The presence of an alkyne group (C#C) is not directly represented in the examples, but the overall complexity and functional groups suggest a positive influence.

Considering these factors, the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is likely to have a positive property value. Given the structural complexity and the presence of both hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, a reasonable prediction would be a value similar to those of other polycyclic compounds with similar functional groups.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule is approximately 1.15151681, similar to the example CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O.

Predicting the property value for the given molecule involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings. The presence of methoxy groups (OC) and hydroxyl groups (O) suggests some degree of polarity, which could influence the property value.

Based on the examples provided, molecules with complex polycyclic structures and multiple functional groups, such as ethers and esters, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21 has a property value of 0.62007083, and it shares some structural complexity with the given molecule.

Considering these factors, I would predict that the property value for the given molecule is likely to be positive and possibly in a similar range to the complex polycyclic structures provided. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule could be approximately:

0.62007083

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.8393991440337654
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that molecules with halogen substitutions on aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccccc1I, Fc1ccccc1, and Clc1cccc2ccccc12, tend to have a property value of 0.0. Additionally, the presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) on an aromatic ring, as seen in Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, results in a property value of 0.55016506.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl has both a hydroxyl group and a chlorine atom attached to a benzene ring. Based on the examples, the presence of a chlorine atom on an aromatic ring often results in a property value of 0.0, while the presence of a hydroxyl group can increase the property value. However, since the examples with halogenated aromatic rings consistently show a property value of 0.0, it is reasonable to predict that the chlorine substitution will dominate the effect.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is 0.0.

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 0.7597987525001713
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C), which is a linear and polarizable group.
- An ester linkage (OC(=O)), which is polar and can contribute to a positive property value.
- An amide linkage (NC(=O)), which is also polar and can contribute to a positive property value.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1), which is similar to some of the examples with zero or slightly positive property values.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with polar functional groups like esters and amides tend to have positive property values.
- Chlorinated aromatic rings alone often have a property value of 0.0, but when combined with other polar groups, the value can increase.

Considering these factors, the presence of both ester and amide groups, along with the chlorinated aromatic ring, suggests a positive property value. However, the presence of the alkyne and the specific arrangement of the groups might moderate the value.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around 0.5.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2) attached to the central carbon.
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of heterocyclic rings like pyrimidine can also contribute to higher property values.
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like chlorine can influence the property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl has multiple aromatic rings, halogen substituents, and a heterocyclic ring, which are features associated with higher property values in the examples.

Based on these observations, I would predict a relatively high property value for this molecule. A reasonable estimate, considering the examples, would be around 1.5.

This structure is similar to the example CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, which has a property value of -0.83939914. Both molecules have a benzene ring with alkyl groups and a hydroxyl group, suggesting similar electronic and steric properties.

Given this similarity, the predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is likely to be close to -0.83939914. Therefore, the predicted specific property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is -0.83939914.

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be quite complex, with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and a sugar-like moiety. Based on the examples provided, molecules with complex structures, especially those containing multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms, tend to have positive property values.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups and rings, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value for this molecule. However, without a specific computational model or further context, providing an exact numerical value is challenging. Based on the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value could be around 1.5, considering the structural complexity and the presence of multiple aromatic and heteroatom-containing rings.

To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) atoms, along with the carbonyl group (C=O), suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and polar interactions, which can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar functional groups and structural features, such as CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C, have a property value of -0.83215056. This molecule also contains a thiosemicarbazide-like structure and a tert-butyl group, which is quite similar to the molecule in question.

Based on this comparison, the predicted property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is likely to be close to -0.83215056. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is approximately -0.832.

Looking at the examples, molecules with ester groups and aromatic rings tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 has a property value of 1.85615733, and CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of 2.04441581. These examples suggest that the combination of an ester group and an aromatic ring contributes to a positive property value.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached. In the examples, simple alkyl chains like CCCCCCCCO have a property value of -0.83939914, and aromatic compounds with halogens like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 have a property value of 0.0. However, the presence of a bromine atom in a non-aromatic, linear alkyl chain is not directly represented in the examples.

Considering the examples, the presence of a halogen in a non-aromatic context tends to have a neutral or slightly negative effect on the property value. Therefore, for CCCCCCCBr, which is a simple alkyl chain with a bromine atom, the property value is likely to be close to that of similar alkyl chains, possibly slightly adjusted due to the presence of bromine.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be approximately -0.83939914, similar to the value for CCCCCCCCO, as both are simple alkyl chains with a terminal functional group.

The examples show that simple hydrocarbons and halogenated compounds often have a property value of 0.0, while more complex or functionalized molecules tend to have non-zero values.

The molecule CO (carbon monoxide) is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is not a hydrocarbon, but it is a small, simple molecule. Given the trend that simple molecules often have a property value of 0.0, it is reasonable to predict that CO would also have a property value of 0.0. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CO is 0.0.
