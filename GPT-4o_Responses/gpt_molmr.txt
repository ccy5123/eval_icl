SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 54.62600000000005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends related to the structure and the property values.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a linear aliphatic ester with a long carbon chain. From the examples, we can observe that:

- Linear aliphatic chains tend to have property values that increase with the length of the carbon chain.
- The presence of an ester functional group (as in CCCCCCCC(=O)OC with a property value of 63.86) also influences the property value.

Given that CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC has one more carbon in the chain compared to CCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can expect the property value to be slightly higher due to the additional carbon.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be slightly higher than 63.86. A predicted value could be around 68.00.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a fused heterocyclic ring containing an oxygen and a nitrogen atom, specifically a chlorinated benzoxazole.

From the examples, we can observe that chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have property values in the range of 38 to 80. For instance, Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 53.1568, and Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 has a value of 38.1268. The presence of additional heteroatoms like oxygen and nitrogen in a fused ring system, as seen in the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, might increase the property value slightly due to increased molecular complexity and potential for additional interactions.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around 50.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite, which contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O).

From the examples, we can observe that the property values seem to be influenced by the size and complexity of the molecule, as well as the presence of certain functional groups. Smaller, simpler molecules with fewer functional groups tend to have lower property values, while larger, more complex molecules with multiple functional groups tend to have higher values.

For instance, simple alkanes like ClCC (16.394) and CCCCCCl (25.628) have lower values, while more complex aromatic compounds like c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45 (87.652) have higher values.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is relatively small and simple, with a single nitro group. Comparing it to similar molecules in the list, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO (40.7042), which also contains a nitro group, we can estimate that the property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O would be lower due to its smaller size and simpler structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O would be around 30.0.

The molecule consists of:
- A difluorobenzene moiety (Fc1cccc(F)c1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N)
- A chlorobenzene moiety (c2ccc(Cl)cc2)

From the examples, we can observe:
- The presence of halogens (F, Cl) tends to increase the property value.
- Amide linkages are present in some examples with moderate property values.

Considering these factors, the molecule has structural similarities to several examples, such as:
- FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 (31.444)
- Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (36.462)
- NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1 (46.8501)

Given the combination of two aromatic rings, halogen substituents, and the amide linkage, the property value is likely to be in the mid to high range of the examples provided.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be approximately 48.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of halogens, especially bromine, tends to increase the property value. Additionally, carbonyl groups also contribute to the property value, as seen in molecules with similar functional groups.

Considering the examples:
- CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of 48.4457.
- Cc1ccccc1O has a property value of 32.8438.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of 36.462.

The molecule in question has a similar structure to CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, which has a bromine and a carbonyl group, and its property value is 48.4457. Given the additional carbonyl group in the pyrrole ring, we can expect the property value to be slightly higher.

True Property: 51.87800000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, we need to consider the structure and compare it with the examples provided. The given molecule is biphenyl, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond.

Looking at the examples, we can see that the property values for aromatic compounds with similar structures, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tend to be higher than those for simpler aliphatic compounds. For instance, the molecule Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34 has a property value of 83.3724, and it consists of three fused benzene rings. The molecule c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67, which is a larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a property value of 105.036.

Biphenyl is simpler than these larger polycyclic structures but more complex than a single benzene ring. The molecule Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1, which is a naphthalene derivative, has a property value of 66.191. Given that biphenyl is structurally similar to naphthalene but without additional substituents, we can expect its property value to be in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around 66.191, similar to the naphthalene derivative.

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 28.76099999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the examples provided and identify patterns or trends related to the structure and the given property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the size of the molecule, the presence of functional groups, and the degree of unsaturation or aromaticity.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear alkane chain with a sulfur atom at the end. It is similar in structure to the linear alkanes and alkenes in the examples, such as CCCCCCC=C (43.573) and CCCCCCC(C)O (45.0568). These examples suggest that the property value for linear alkanes and similar structures tends to be in the range of 30 to 50.

Given that CCCCCS is a five-carbon chain with a sulfur atom, it is slightly larger than the simplest alkanes but smaller than the longer chains. The presence of sulfur, which is more electronegative than carbon, might slightly increase the property value compared to a similar hydrocarbon chain.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be around 40. This value is consistent with the trend observed in the examples for similar-sized molecules with heteroatoms.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCS is approximately 40.

True Property: 35.77479999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with a tertiary carbon attached to an alcohol group. 

Looking at similar structures in the examples:
- CCC(C)(C)C has a property value of 29.746.
- CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O has a property value of 47.3498.
- CCCC(C)(O)CC has a property value of 35.8228.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is similar to CCCC(C)(O)CC, but with a slightly different branching and an alcohol group. The presence of the alcohol group generally increases the property value compared to alkanes due to increased polarity and potential hydrogen bonding.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO would likely be slightly higher than that of CCCC(C)(O)CC, but not as high as CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O, which has a more complex ring structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO would be around 36.5.

The structure of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is a naphthalene ring system without any additional substituents, which is simpler than the example with a methyl group (Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12). Therefore, we can expect the property value to be slightly lower than 53.422 due to the absence of the methyl group.

Considering this, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 would be approximately 50.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is a cyclic compound with a bicyclic structure, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of 44.6024.

The difference between the two molecules is the substitution of a methyl group (C) with a more complex alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the new molecule. This substitution increases the molecular size and potentially the property value, as seen in other examples where larger or more complex substituents tend to increase the property value.

Considering this, the property value for O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is likely to be slightly higher than 44.6024. Based on the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 48.0.

Iteration: 13
SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 31.444
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic rings, such as benzene, tend to have moderate property values. The presence of halogens, like chlorine or fluorine, generally increases the property value compared to non-halogenated analogs. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of 44.169, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a value of 81.938.

Considering the trifluoromethyl group, which is electron-withdrawing and increases the molecular weight, we can expect the property value to be higher than that of benzene alone. However, it is likely to be lower than the highly chlorinated compounds due to the smaller size and lower number of halogen atoms.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around 50.

Looking at the examples, the molecule OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, which is a linear sugar alcohol, has a property value of 38.1988. The cyclic structure of OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is similar in terms of functional groups and overall composition, but the cyclic nature might slightly alter the property value.

Given the similarity in structure and functional groups, the property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is likely to be close to that of the linear sugar alcohol. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O would be approximately 38.2.

- CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C, which has a property value of 87.3338.

The given molecule has additional oxygen-containing functional groups compared to these examples, which might slightly increase its property value due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be slightly higher than 96.881, but not exceeding the highest value in the examples (102.2816). Therefore, a predicted property value could be around:

1. **Structural Analysis**: 
   - The molecule has an acetamide group (CC(=O)N-) attached to a phenyl ring.
   - The phenyl ring has a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to it.

2. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - The molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (39.6484) is similar in that it has a nitro group on a phenyl ring, but with a methoxy group instead of an acetamide.
   - The molecule O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (33.0964) is a simpler nitrobenzene, lacking the acetamide group.
   - The molecule O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12 (50.6024) is a more complex structure with two aromatic rings and a nitro group.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The presence of the acetamide group in CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O adds to the complexity and potential interactions compared to nitrobenzene.
   - The property value is likely to be higher than that of nitrobenzene (33.0964) but lower than the more complex polycyclic aromatic compound (50.6024).

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O would be around 42.5.

- CCCCCCC(C)O (a longer chain alcohol) with a property value of 45.0568
- CCC (propane) with a property value of 15.965

Tert-butanol is similar to isobutanol but with an additional methyl group, which typically increases the property value slightly due to increased molecular weight and branching. Given that isobutanol has a property value of 21.9238, we can expect tert-butanol to have a slightly higher value due to the additional methyl group and increased branching.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO (tert-butanol) would be around 25.0.

- Larger esters like CCCOC(C)C have a property value of 31.379.
- The presence of an ester functional group (C=O)O tends to increase the property value compared to similar alcohols or alkanes.

Given that CC(C)OC=O is a small ester, we can expect its property value to be slightly higher than that of isopropanol (17.3548) but lower than larger esters like CCCOC(C)C (31.379).

Given the structural similarity and the pattern observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 would be around 78.96. However, considering the specific structure of triphenylene, which is slightly more compact than the example provided, a slightly lower value might be more appropriate.

Therefore, I would predict the property value for C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 to be approximately 77.5.

- An amine group (CCN) attached to the aromatic ring, similar to some examples.

By comparing with the examples, particularly those with nitro groups and aromatic rings, we can estimate the property value. The presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and trifluoromethyl) suggests a higher property value compared to simpler aromatic compounds.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 70.0.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 22.284999999999993
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples. The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl acetate, an ester.

From the examples, we have:
- CC(C)CCOC=O (an ester with a similar structure but a longer carbon chain) has a property value of 31.471.
- CCC(C)(C)O (a tertiary alcohol with a similar carbon skeleton) has a property value of 26.5888.

Considering the structural similarities and the fact that esters generally have property values in the range of 20-40, we can estimate that the property value for CC(C)OC=O would be slightly lower than that of CC(C)CCOC=O due to the shorter carbon chain.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O is approximately 28.5.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 37.5808
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the simpler aromatic compounds in the examples.

Looking at the examples, we have:
- c1ccccc1O (phenol) with a property value of 28.1068
- Cc1cccc(C)c1 (dimethylbenzene) with a property value of 35.5914

The target molecule, Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, is a combination of these two structures: a phenol with an additional methyl group. The presence of the hydroxyl group (O) and the methyl group (C) suggests that the property value should be slightly higher than that of phenol but not as high as dimethylbenzene, which has two methyl groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be around 32.5.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 71.89100000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), methoxy groups (OC), and a substituted aromatic ring with a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C).

From the examples, we can see that molecules with similar functional groups and aromatic structures tend to have property values in a certain range. For instance, the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has a property value of 73.093, and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has a property value of 78.11. These molecules have halogen substitutions on the aromatic ring, which can increase the property value.

The target molecule has a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) on the aromatic ring, which are less electron-withdrawing than halogens. Therefore, we can expect the property value to be somewhat lower than those with halogen substitutions.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 would be around 68.0.

True Property: 76.92800000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound, specifically a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) derivative, which is similar to some of the other chlorinated aromatic compounds in the list.

Looking at the examples, we have:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of 81.938
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of 86.948

The given molecule, Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, has a similar structure to these examples, with multiple chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings. The structure suggests it is less chlorinated than the second example but more than the first example.

Based on this analysis, the predicted property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would likely be between the values of the two examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately 84.5.

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 22.152399999999997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group attached to the end. 

Looking at the examples, we can see that small aliphatic chains like CCC (15.965) and CC (11.348) have relatively low property values. The presence of a nitro group, as seen in other examples like O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (46.4052), tends to increase the property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature and additional mass.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCN(=O)=O is likely to be higher than that of CCC due to the presence of the nitro group. However, it should be lower than more complex structures with multiple nitro groups or larger aromatic systems.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 25.0.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 34.1
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a bromobenzene with a fluorine substituent, which is similar to the example Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 with a property value of 39.152. 

The presence of a fluorine atom instead of a chlorine atom might slightly alter the property value due to differences in electronegativity and atomic size. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which could lead to a slightly different interaction profile. However, given the examples, the property values for similar aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to be in the same range.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be slightly lower than 39.152 due to the presence of fluorine instead of chlorine. Therefore, a predicted property value could be approximately 38.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group, similar to some of the examples given.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclo[3.3.0]octane derivative with a tertiary alcohol. The closest examples in the list are those with similar bicyclic structures and alcohol groups, such as CC1CCCO1 (24.648) and CCC1(CCC(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O (58.4774). However, these examples differ in the presence of additional functional groups and ring sizes.

Considering the structure of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, it is likely to have a property value between the simpler cyclic alcohols and more complex bicyclic structures. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 35.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), an amide linkage, and a phenyl ring. A similar molecule from the examples is CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 96.578. This molecule also contains a phosphorothioate group, an amide linkage, and a phenyl ring, but it has additional substituents like a thioether and a chloro group.

Given that the molecule in question lacks the thioether and chloro group, which could contribute to a higher property value, we can expect its property value to be somewhat lower than 96.578. However, the core structure is quite similar, so the value should not be drastically different.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 90.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, specifically a methylated benzotriazole.

Looking at the examples, we can identify similar structures and their property values:

1. Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O (76.814) - This molecule has a similar heterocyclic structure with a carbonyl group and a benzene ring.
2. CN2C(=C(O)c1ccccc1S2(=O)=O)C(=O)Nc3ccccn3 (83.8063) - This molecule also contains a heterocyclic structure with a carbonyl group and aromatic rings.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is simpler than the above examples, lacking additional functional groups like sulfonyl or additional aromatic rings. Therefore, its property value is likely lower than those examples.

Considering the structural similarities and the complexity of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around 60. This is based on the presence of the carbonyl group, the aromatic ring, and the nitrogen-containing heterocycle, which contribute to the property value but are not as complex as the higher-valued examples.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 40.775000000000006
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which consists of a heptanoic acid moiety (CCCCCCC(=O)O) and an ethyl group (CC).

From the examples, we have:

- CCCCCCCI (47.646): A straight-chain alkane with an iodine atom.
- CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (50.009): A nonanoate ester, which is similar in structure to the given molecule but with a longer carbon chain.
- CCCCCC (25.199): A straight-chain hexane.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is structurally similar to CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, but with one less carbon in the main chain. The property value for CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is 50.009. Given that the molecule in question has a slightly shorter carbon chain, we can expect its property value to be slightly lower than 50.009.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around 48.5.

Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a calculated property such as molecular weight, boiling point, or a similar characteristic. The molecule in question, COC(=O)c1ccccc1, is methyl benzoate.

To predict the property value for methyl benzoate, we can compare it to similar structures in the examples:

- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 has a property value of 44.0633.
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of 42.3985.

The structure COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is very similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, differing only by the absence of an additional carbon in the alkyl chain. Given this similarity, the property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 should be slightly lower than 42.3985.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately 41.

Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 25.01099999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are related to the molecular structure, likely reflecting some aspect of the molecule's size, complexity, or functional groups.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear chain with two double bonds, making it a conjugated diene. It is relatively small and simple compared to many of the examples provided. Looking at similar small and simple molecules in the examples:

- CC/C=C/C (25.105)
- CCC(=O)C (20.972)
- C=Cc1ccccc1 (36.533)

These examples suggest that small, simple hydrocarbons or those with minimal functional groups tend to have lower property values, often in the range of 20 to 40.

Given the structure of C=CCC=C and its similarity to the example CC/C=C/C, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be slightly above 25, considering the presence of conjugation which might slightly increase the value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for C=CCC=C is approximately 27.

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 30.569
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a physicochemical property such as molecular weight, boiling point, or a similar characteristic.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is tribromomethane, also known as bromoform. It is a small molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples provided, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly bromine, tend to have higher property values. For instance, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of 51.648, and Ic1cccc2ccccc12 has a value of 56.665. These values are relatively high compared to non-halogenated compounds.

Given that BrC(Br)Br is a simple molecule with three bromine atoms, we can expect its property value to be influenced significantly by the presence of these heavy halogen atoms. Considering the examples and the trend that more halogen atoms generally increase the property value, we can predict that the property value for BrC(Br)Br will be higher than those of simpler halogenated compounds but lower than those with more complex structures or additional functional groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around 60. This estimate considers the high contribution of the three bromine atoms to the property value, similar to the trend observed in the examples.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 96.57800000000005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule contains several functional groups and structural features that can influence its property value:

1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)**: This group is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 94.835. The presence of this group suggests a relatively high property value.

2. **Thioester Linkage (SC(CCl))**: This linkage is not directly present in the examples, but thioesters generally contribute to a moderate increase in property values.

3. **Chlorine Substituent (CCl)**: Chlorine atoms tend to increase the property value, as seen in several examples with chlorinated aromatic rings.

4. **Imide Group (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)**: This group is similar to the imide group in CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O, which has a property value of 61.735. The presence of an imide group typically contributes to a moderate property value.

5. **Aromatic Ring (c1ccccc1)**: Aromatic rings are common in the examples and generally contribute to an increase in property value.

Considering these structural features and comparing them to the examples, the molecule is likely to have a property value in the higher range due to the combination of the phosphorothioate group, chlorine substituent, and aromatic ring. However, it may not be as high as the example with a similar phosphorothioate group due to the absence of additional electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be approximately **90.0**.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A dimethylamino group (CN(C)C(=O))
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1ccc(c(Cl)c1))
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle (n2nc(oc2=O))
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens (e.g., Cl) tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles also contributes to higher values.
- The tert-butyl group can increase the property value due to its bulkiness.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a property value higher than simpler aromatic compounds with halogens but lower than very large or complex structures.

Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be around 65.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with three chlorine atoms attached to the rings. We can compare it to similar structures in the examples:

1. Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl (38.1268) - This is a dichlorinated phenol, with two chlorine atoms on a single phenyl ring.
2. Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 (61.898) - This is a biphenyl with two chlorine atoms on one ring and no ether linkage.

The target molecule has an ether linkage and an additional chlorine atom compared to the first example, and it has a similar biphenyl structure to the second example but with an ether linkage and an additional chlorine.

Considering these comparisons, the property value is likely to be higher than the dichlorinated phenol (38.1268) due to the additional chlorine and the biphenyl structure. It might be slightly lower or comparable to the biphenyl with two chlorines (61.898) due to the ether linkage, which can affect the property.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be around 60.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC/C=C\C, we can look at the examples provided and identify similar structures. The molecule CC/C=C\C is a linear alkene with four carbon atoms, also known as 2-butene. 

In the examples, the molecule CC/C=C/C, which is 2-pentene, has a property value of 25.105. Since 2-butene is a smaller molecule than 2-pentene, we can expect its property value to be slightly lower due to the reduced molecular size and mass.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC/C=C\C (2-butene) would be slightly less than 25.105. A predicted value could be around 23.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCOCC is a simple linear ether, specifically diethyl ether. 

Looking at the examples, we can see that small, simple aliphatic molecules with similar structures, such as CC(C)O (17.3548) and CCC(O)CC (26.5888), have relatively low property values. The presence of an ether linkage (C-O-C) in CCCOCC is similar to the structure of CC(C)O, which also contains an ether linkage.

Given the simplicity and size of the molecule CCCOCC, and comparing it to similar molecules in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be slightly higher than CC(C)O due to the additional carbon atom, but still relatively low. Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCOCC could be around 20.5.

This molecule contains:
- A tertiary amide group (N(C=O)N)
- Two phenyl rings (c1ccccc1 and c2ccccc2)
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C))

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with phenyl rings, such as c1ccccc1n2ncc(N)c(Br)c2(=O) (61.9464) and CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 (84.967), tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of an amide group, as seen in CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 (84.967), also contributes to a higher property value.
- The tert-butyl group, as seen in CC(C)C=C (25.035), is a smaller contributor compared to aromatic rings and amide groups.

Considering these factors, the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally similar to CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 84.967. However, the tert-butyl group might slightly lower the value compared to the methoxy group in the example.

1. **Structural Analysis**: 
   - The molecule has an acetamide group (CC(=O)N-) attached to a brominated phenyl ring (c1ccc(Br)cc1).
   - Similar structures in the examples include:

     - Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 (35.8068): A brominated phenyl ring with a hydroxyl group.
     - Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (36.462): A dichlorinated phenyl ring.
     - ClCc1ccccc1 (35.999): A chlorinated phenyl ring.

2. **Comparison**:
   - The presence of a bromine atom typically increases the property value compared to hydrogen, similar to chlorine.
   - The acetamide group (CC(=O)N-) is a common functional group that can be compared to other carbonyl-containing structures.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Given the examples, the property values for molecules with halogenated phenyl rings and additional functional groups (like carbonyls) tend to be in the mid-30s range.
   - Considering the structural similarity to Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 and ClCc1ccccc1, and the additional acetamide group, the property value is likely slightly higher than these examples.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately **36.5**.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples. This molecule is isopropylbenzene, also known as cumene.

From the examples, we have:
- Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) with a property value of 35.5914
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethylbenzene) with a property value of 40.557
- C=Cc1ccccc1 (styrene) with a property value of 36.533
- Cc1cccc2ccccc12 (naphthalene) with a property value of 48.685
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (p-cymene) with a property value of 45.268

The structure of cumene (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1) is similar to ethylbenzene (CCc1ccc(C)cc1) but with an additional methyl group on the side chain, which should increase the property value slightly due to the increased molecular size and hydrophobicity.

Considering these comparisons, a reasonable prediction for the property value of cumene (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1) would be slightly higher than that of ethylbenzene. Therefore, a predicted property value for cumene could be around 42.5.

True Property: 31.829499999999992
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

Looking at the examples, we can find similar structures:
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (36.6247): This is salicylamide, which has a benzene ring with an amide and a hydroxyl group.
- COc1ccccc1 (32.994): This is anisole, which has a benzene ring with a methoxy group.
- O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O (39.7508): This is dinitrobenzene, which has a benzene ring with two nitro groups.

Benzaldehyde is simpler than dinitrobenzene but more complex than anisole due to the presence of the carbonyl group. It is also somewhat similar to salicylamide in terms of having a carbonyl group attached to the benzene ring, but without the additional hydroxyl group.

Considering these comparisons, the property value for benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) is likely to be between the values for anisole and salicylamide. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of benzaldehyde would be around 34.5.

Additionally, the molecule has a lactam ring structure, which is a cyclic amide, similar to some of the other examples with moderate property values.

Considering these structural features and comparing them to the examples, the presence of the nitro group and the cyclic amide suggests a property value in the mid to high range. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 70.0.

True Property: 60.129400000000025
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the examples provided. This molecule is a diphenylhydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group.

From the examples, we have:
- N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 with a property value of 57.06.

The given molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally similar to the example N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, with the main difference being the presence of a single bond between the nitrogen atoms instead of a double bond. This change might slightly affect the property value, but the overall structure remains quite similar.

Considering the structural similarity and the property value of the example, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be close to 57.06. However, due to the single bond, the value might be slightly lower. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 55.0.

True Property: 42.582400000000014
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a relatively small and compact structure with two amide bonds and a cyclohexane ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1, which is also a cyclic compound with amide groups and has a property value of 48.3414.

Considering the structural similarities, particularly the presence of the cyclic structure and amide groups, the property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be in a similar range. Therefore, I would predict the property value to be approximately 48.34.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the examples provided.

The given molecule is 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with three chlorine atoms attached. In the examples, we have:

- Clc1ccccc1Cl (1,2-dichlorobenzene) with a property value of 36.462.
- Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl with a property value of 85.037.

The molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is more similar to Clc1ccccc1Cl but with an additional chlorine atom, which generally increases the property value due to increased molecular weight and potential changes in other properties like hydrophobicity.

Considering the trend that adding more chlorine atoms tends to increase the property value, and given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be slightly higher than that of Clc1ccccc1Cl.

Therefore, a predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl could be approximately 45.0.

True Property: 45.19800000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

Looking at the examples, we can find similar structures:
- Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) has a property value of 35.5914.
- CCc1ccccn1 (ethylpyridine) has a property value of 33.615.

Both of these molecules have a benzene ring with a small substituent. The molecule in question, CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, is diethylbenzene, which is slightly larger than ethylbenzene or aniline due to the additional ethyl group.

Considering the trend that adding more alkyl groups to a benzene ring tends to increase the property value slightly, we can predict that the property value for diethylbenzene (CCc1ccc(CC)cc1) will be slightly higher than that of ethylpyridine (33.615) and aniline (35.5914).

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be around 37.0.

- Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12 with a property value of 36.0961
- Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O with a property value of 37.5088

Both of these molecules contain nitrogen and aromatic rings, similar to the target molecule. The sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is somewhat similar in electron-withdrawing nature to the nitro group (N(=O)=O) in the second example.

Given the structural similarities and the electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents, the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is likely to be close to that of the nitro-substituted aniline. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be approximately 37.5.

- c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 with a property value of 85.884

Both of these examples are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with multiple fused benzene rings, similar to the given molecule. The structure of the given molecule is similar to these examples, but it is slightly more compact and symmetric, which might slightly affect the property value.

Based on these comparisons, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 would be around 85.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple aromatic rings and additional functional groups like hydroxyls and ketones tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5 has a property value of 141.5886, and it contains multiple aromatic rings and functional groups.

The molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 has a similar complexity with multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups, which suggests a relatively high property value. Based on the pattern observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 90 to 100.

Therefore, a predicted property value for Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 could be approximately 95.

True Property: 41.94720000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)), an amide group (NC(C)=O), and a methoxy group (OC). 

Looking at the examples, we can find some similar structural features:

1. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a phosphorothioate group and a methoxy group, with a property value of 70.403.
2. COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a phosphonate group and a methoxy group, with a property value of 78.0115.
3. CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C has a phosphorothioate group and an amide group, with a property value of 94.255.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is simpler than the third example but shares the phosphorothioate and amide groups. It is also simpler than the first two examples, which have additional aromatic rings and halogens contributing to higher property values.

Considering these comparisons, the property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is likely to be lower than 70.403 but higher than simpler structures without these functional groups. A reasonable estimate would be around 50-60.

Therefore, a predicted property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC could be approximately 55.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 20.845999999999997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is a simple alkene with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. This structure is relatively small and simple compared to many of the examples provided. The presence of chlorine atoms typically increases the property value compared to hydrocarbons of similar size, as seen in examples like Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl (38.1268) and Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (35.8644).

Given the simplicity of Cl\C=C/Cl and the presence of two chlorine atoms, we can estimate that its property value will be lower than those of larger, more complex molecules with multiple functional groups. However, it will be higher than simple hydrocarbons without halogens.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around 30.0.

True Property: 24.236999999999995
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size.

Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle similar to benzene but with one nitrogen atom replacing a CH group. Comparing pyridine to similar structures in the examples:

- Benzene (c1ccccc1) is not explicitly listed, but we can infer its property value from similar aromatic compounds.
- Pyridine is similar to the example CNc1ccccc1 (aniline), which has a property value of 35.9887. Aniline has an additional amino group compared to pyridine, which likely increases its property value.

Considering pyridine's aromaticity and the presence of a nitrogen atom, its property value should be slightly lower than that of aniline due to the absence of additional functional groups.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of pyridine (c1ccncc1) would be approximately 33.0.

True Property: 99.85280000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has several key features:
1. An ester linkage (OC(=O)).
2. A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1).
3. An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23).
4. A chlorinated aromatic ring.
5. A polycyclic aromatic system.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and additional functional groups like esters and amides tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of chlorine in aromatic systems also tends to increase the property value.
- Polycyclic aromatic systems generally have higher property values.

Considering these factors, the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 is expected to have a relatively high property value due to its complex structure, presence of multiple aromatic rings, and chlorine substitution.

Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 70.0.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 26.61079999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the degree of saturation.

The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol with five carbon atoms and one hydroxyl group. It is similar in structure to hexane (CCCCCC) but with an alcohol group replacing one hydrogen atom. In the examples, the property value for a linear alkane like hexane (CCCCCC) is not directly given, but we can infer from similar structures:

- OC1CCCCCCC1 (a cyclic alcohol) has a property value of 38.3258.
- CCCCCCCCI (a linear alkane with an iodine atom) has a property value of 47.646.

Considering the presence of the hydroxyl group, which typically increases the property value compared to a simple alkane due to its polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, we can estimate the property value for CCCCCO to be slightly higher than a simple linear alkane but lower than a cyclic alcohol.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be around 40.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

This molecule contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is known to increase the property value due to its polar nature.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is also polar and contributes to a higher property value.
- An aromatic ring (phenyl group), which is common in several examples and tends to increase the property value.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which is less polar than the sulfonyl and amide groups but still contributes to the property value.

Comparing with similar structures:
- The molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC has a property value of 44.6964, and it contains amide groups and a cyclic structure.
- The molecule CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C has a property value of 91.8042, and it contains a sulfonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Given the presence of both a sulfonyl group and an aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be higher than those with only one of these features. However, the presence of the ether linkage and the specific cyclic structure may moderate the increase.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be around 70.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:

1. **Aromatic Ring**: The presence of a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) is a common feature in many of the examples, which often contributes to higher property values.
2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The presence of a nitro group is known to increase the property value, as seen in examples like CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O (77.5478) and Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (37.8334).
3. **Ester Groups (C(=O)OC)**: The molecule has two ester groups, which are also present in some examples with moderate to high property values, such as CCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC (113.759).
4. **Heterocyclic Ring**: The presence of a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen (C1=C(C)NC) can also influence the property value, as seen in some examples.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule has a combination of structural elements that suggest a moderate to high property value. The presence of multiple functional groups and aromaticity typically increases the property value.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately **85.0**.

True Property: 33.3484
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. This molecule is a bicyclic compound with two amide groups and a cyclopropane ring.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of amide groups and small rings tends to result in moderate property values. For instance, the molecule ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of 76.2357, and it contains amide groups and a cyclic structure. However, it also has additional chlorine atoms and a larger aromatic system, which likely increases its property value.

The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is simpler, with no halogens or large aromatic systems, and the cyclopropane ring is relatively small. Based on the examples, simpler structures with fewer heavy atoms and smaller rings tend to have lower property values.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around 40. This is a moderate value, reflecting the presence of the amide groups and the small cyclopropane ring, without the influence of additional heavy atoms or large aromatic systems.

SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 16.394000000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can look at the examples provided and identify trends or patterns based on the structure and the known property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the size and complexity of the molecule, as well as the presence of specific functional groups.

The molecule ClCC is a simple, small molecule with a chloro group attached to an ethyl group. In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules tend to have lower property values. For instance, CC#N has a property value of 11.287, and c1ccoc1 has a value of 18.708. The presence of a chloro group, as seen in Clc1ccccc1 (31.452) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (46.482), tends to increase the property value, but these examples are for larger aromatic systems.

Given the simplicity and small size of ClCC, along with the presence of a single chloro group, I would predict a property value slightly higher than the smallest examples but lower than the larger aromatic systems with chloro groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be around 20.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule consists of a chlorinated pyridine ring with a trichloromethyl group attached. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have property values in the range of 50-70.
- The presence of additional chlorine atoms generally increases the property value.

For instance:
- Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2 (a biphenyl with two chlorines) has a property value of 56.888.
- Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (a biphenyl with three chlorines) has a property value of 66.908.

Given that Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a pyridine ring (which might slightly lower the property value compared to a benzene ring) and a trichloromethyl group (which increases the property value), we can estimate the property value to be slightly higher than the chlorinated biphenyl with three chlorines.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl would be around 68.

True Property: 31.205799999999982
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCC(C)O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCC(C)O is a primary alcohol with a five-carbon chain and a hydroxyl group attached to the second carbon, making it 2-hexanol.

Looking at similar structures in the examples:

- CCCCCCCCl (1-chloroheptane) has a property value of 39.479.
- CCC(C)CCO (2-pentanol) has a property value of 31.1578.
- CCC(CC)CO (3-pentanol) also has a property value of 31.1578.
- CCCCC(O)CCC (2-octanol) has a property value of 35.8228.

2-hexanol is structurally similar to 2-pentanol and 3-pentanol, but with an additional carbon, making it closer to 2-octanol. Given the trend in the examples, the property value for CCCCC(C)O (2-hexanol) is likely to be slightly higher than that of 2-pentanol and 3-pentanol, but lower than 2-octanol.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCC(C)O (2-hexanol) is approximately 33.5.

- ClC(Cl)Cl (chloroform) has a property value of 21.347.
- ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl (carbon tetrachloride) has a property value of 30.988.
- Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) has a property value of 38.1268.
- Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl (1,4-dichlorobenzene) has a property value of 61.898.

The structure of 1,4-dibromobenzene is similar to 1,4-dichlorobenzene, but with bromine atoms instead of chlorine. Bromine is heavier and larger than chlorine, which might affect the property value. Given that 1,4-dichlorobenzene has a property value of 61.898, we can expect 1,4-dibromobenzene to have a slightly higher property value due to the presence of bromine.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 (1,4-dibromobenzene) would be around 65.0.

The given molecule has two phenyl rings, each with four chlorine atoms, making it a highly chlorinated biphenyl. The example molecule has a similar structure but with more chlorine atoms. Given the structural similarity and the number of chlorine atoms, we can expect the property value to be somewhat lower than 101.978 due to fewer chlorine atoms.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately 90.0.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and additional functional groups (like carbonyl, nitro, or halogen) tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of a phosphate group, as seen in some examples, also contributes to a higher property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule is structurally complex with multiple aromatic rings and a phosphate group, suggesting a higher property value. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 85.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to increase the property value due to its electronegativity and steric effects.
- An aromatic ring, which is a common feature in many of the examples.
- A piperidine-like ring with two chlorine atoms and a ketone group, which adds complexity and likely increases the property value.

Comparing with similar structures:
- The presence of multiple halogens (like Cl and F) tends to increase the property value, as seen in examples with multiple chlorines.
- The presence of a ketone group in a cyclic structure is similar to some examples with higher property values.

Considering these factors and comparing with the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 70.0.

True Property: 39.64840000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (CO) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) also attached to the ring.

From the examples, we can identify some similar structures:
- c1ccccc1O (phenol) has a property value of 28.1068.
- O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (dinitrobenzene) has a property value of 39.7508.
- Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (a chlorinated benzene derivative) has a property value of 48.484.

The presence of the methoxy group in COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is similar to the phenol example, which has a lower property value, while the nitro group is similar to the dinitrobenzene example, which has a higher property value. The combination of these functional groups suggests that the property value will be between these two examples.

Considering the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group and the electron-donating nature of the methoxy group, the property value is likely to be closer to the dinitrobenzene example but slightly lower due to the presence of only one nitro group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is approximately 35.0.

SMILES: ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl
True Property: 81.21600000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, which suggests it might have a relatively high property value due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms. Chlorine atoms generally increase the property value, as seen in the examples with multiple chlorines.

Looking at the examples:
- ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl has a property value of 57.846.
- Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 48.1468.

The given molecule has more chlorine atoms than the first example and is more complex in structure, which suggests a higher property value. Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl would be around 65.0.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 22.306999999999995
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is a simple ester, specifically propyl formate. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Small aliphatic molecules like CC(Cl)Cl (21.168) and CCC#C (19.124) have lower property values.
- Molecules with aromatic rings or more complex structures tend to have higher values, such as Clc1ccccc1I (44.169) and Clc1ccccc1Cl (36.462).
- Esters like CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 (46.8109) have moderate values, but this example includes an aromatic ring, which increases the value.

Given that CCCOC=O is a small aliphatic ester without any aromatic rings, we can expect its property value to be lower than those of aromatic esters but higher than simple alkanes or alkynes. 

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be around 25.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 59.24300000000005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically a decanoate ester, with a long alkyl chain (10 carbon atoms) and an ethyl group attached to the ester functional group.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with longer alkyl chains tend to have higher property values. For instance, CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 has a property value of 54.288, and CCCCCC=C(CC)C=O has a value of 39.346.
2. Esters and similar functional groups also influence the property value. For example, CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C has a high property value of 109.323, but it is a more complex molecule.

Considering the structure of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, it is less complex than the high-value examples but has a longer alkyl chain than some of the lower-value examples. Therefore, we can expect its property value to be moderate to high, influenced by both the long alkyl chain and the ester group.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around 60.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to the aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe that:
- The presence of aromatic rings generally increases the property value.
- The presence of nitro groups, as seen in Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (38.1064), tends to increase the property value.
- The presence of chlorine atoms, as seen in Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl (69.6528), also tends to increase the property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule in question has structural similarities to Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O and Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, both of which have relatively high property values. The additional amide linkage and the second chlorine atom suggest a further increase in the property value.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be around 70.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O) attached to aromatic rings, which is a significant structural feature. In the examples, the molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of 94.835. This molecule also contains a phosphorothioate group and an aromatic ring, along with additional functional groups.

The target molecule has a similar complexity due to the presence of two phosphorothioate groups and two aromatic rings, which suggests a relatively high property value. Given the structural similarities and the complexity of the molecule, we can predict that the property value will be somewhat higher than 94.835, but not excessively so, as the examples do not exceed 100.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 would be approximately 98.5.

True Property: 34.7612
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we have:
- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (nitrotoluene) with a property value of 37.8334.
- Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 (chlorophenylamine) with a property value of 35.8644.
- Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 (cresol) with a property value of 37.5808.

The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is similar to nitrotoluene but with a hydroxyl group instead of a methyl group. The presence of the hydroxyl group, which is more polar than a methyl group, might slightly increase the property value compared to nitrotoluene.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be slightly higher than that of nitrotoluene. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 38.5.

True Property: 101.27480000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a complex sugar, likely a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide, given the multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic ether structures.

From the examples, it seems the property values are related to molecular size, complexity, and possibly polarity or solubility. Larger and more complex molecules tend to have higher property values. For instance, large cyclic structures and those with multiple functional groups like hydroxyls and ethers tend to have higher values.

The given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, is a large, complex sugar with multiple hydroxyl groups, which suggests a high degree of solubility and a significant molecular size.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the degree of unsaturation.

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne with a triple bond, specifically 1-butyne. It is a relatively small molecule with a simple structure compared to many of the examples provided. The examples with small, simple hydrocarbons or those with minimal functional groups tend to have lower property values.

For instance, the molecule CCC(C)C(=O)C, which is a small ketone, has a property value of 30.136. Similarly, CCC(C)OC=O, an ester, has a property value of 22.285. Given that CCC#C is a small alkyne, it is likely to have a property value in a similar range, possibly slightly lower due to its smaller size and lack of additional functional groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around 25.0.

- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to the example Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of 81.938.

Considering these structural similarities, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms, and the phosphorothioate group, the property value is likely to be influenced by both the electron-withdrawing effects of the chlorine atoms and the presence of the P=S group.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl would be around 85.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)(O)), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1 with a property value of 66.7644.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is present in several examples, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C with a property value of 32.77.
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1), which is a saturated six-membered nitrogen-containing ring, similar to the cyclohexane ring in C/C1CCCCC1\C with a property value of 36.796.

Considering these structural features and their contributions to the property values in the examples, the presence of the phosphorothioate group is likely to have a significant impact on the property value, as seen in the example with a similar group. The amide linkage and the piperidine ring will also contribute to the overall property value.

Taking into account the complexity and the presence of these functional groups, the predicted property value for CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is likely to be in the range of 70 to 80. Given the examples and the structural similarities, a reasonable prediction would be:

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 39.05
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCCCC is a linear alkane, specifically octane, with the formula C8H18.

From the examples, we can observe that linear alkanes and similar simple hydrocarbons tend to have lower property values. For instance:
- CCCCCC (hexane) has a property value of 35.8448.
- CCCCCC/C=C/C (a linear alkene) has a property value of 34.339.
- C/C1CCCCC1\C (a cycloalkane) has a property value of 36.796.

Given that octane (CCCCCCCC) is a longer linear alkane than hexane, we can expect its property value to be slightly higher than that of hexane. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC would be around 37.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group and an alkyne group. It shares some structural similarities with the following examples:

1. CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO, which has a property value of 99.9444.
2. CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 82.7168.

Both of these examples are polycyclic compounds with ketone and hydroxyl groups. The presence of the alkyne group in the target molecule might slightly lower the property value compared to the first example, which has additional functional groups like fluorine and more complex ring structures.

Considering these factors, the property value for the given molecule is likely to be closer to the second example but slightly higher due to the additional alkyne group, which can increase the complexity and potentially the property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C would be approximately 85.0.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the specific property value for the given molecule based on the examples provided is a complex task, as it involves understanding the relationship between molecular structure and the property in question. The examples suggest that the property might be related to molecular size, complexity, or specific functional groups, but without knowing the exact nature of the property, it's challenging to make an accurate prediction.

The given molecule, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and hydroxyl groups, suggesting a high degree of complexity and potential for a high property value if the property is related to molecular size or complexity.

Based on the examples, complex polycyclic structures with multiple functional groups tend to have higher property values. Therefore, I would predict a property value in the higher range of the examples provided, possibly around 100. However, this is a rough estimate and should be taken with caution due to the lack of specific information about the property being predicted.

- Clc1ccccc1I (iodobenzene) has a property value of 44.169.
- Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (nitrophenol) has a property value of 34.7612.
- Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (another nitrophenol) has a property value of 34.7612.

The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) and a chlorine atom (Cl) on a benzene ring suggests that the property value should be influenced by both the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine and the electron-donating effect of the hydroxyl group. The property value is likely to be between those of simple halogenated benzenes and phenols.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around 35.0.

1. A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C).
2. An ester linkage (OC(=O)).
3. An amide group (NC(=O)).
4. A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1).

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens (e.g., Cl, F) tend to have higher property values, such as Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (86.948) and Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2cc(Cl)c(F)c(Cl)c2F (79.2209).
- Molecules with ester and amide groups also contribute to higher property values, as seen in O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (99.5257).

Considering these factors, the presence of both an ester and an amide group, along with a chlorinated aromatic ring, suggests a relatively high property value. However, the molecule is not as complex or heavily substituted as some of the highest examples.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around 60 to 70. Given the specific structure and comparison to similar examples, a more precise estimate would be:

3. A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2), which is a heterocyclic aromatic compound, similar to Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2, which has a property value of 36.7928.

The molecule is a combination of these structural features, and the presence of multiple aromatic rings and chlorine substituents suggests a higher property value. Considering the examples, the property values for molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to be in the range of 50 to 80.

Taking into account the structural complexity and the presence of multiple chlorine atoms, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl would be around 70.

Let's consider the examples with similar structures:
- CCCC(=O)OCC has a property value of 31.541.
- CCCCCCC=O has a property value of 30.206.

The molecule CCCCCOC=O is an ester with a similar chain length to these examples. Given the trend in the examples, the property value for CCCCCOC=O is likely to be slightly higher than CCCC(=O)OCC due to the additional carbon in the chain, but not as high as CCCCCCC=O, which is a ketone.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples. The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a methylphenol, specifically p-cresol, which consists of a benzene ring with a methyl group and a hydroxyl group attached.

From the examples, we can identify similar structures:
- Oc1cccc(O)c1 (phenol) has a property value of 29.7716.
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O (a methylated phenol) has a property value of 46.9328.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is structurally similar to phenol but with an additional methyl group, which typically increases the property value due to increased molecular weight and hydrophobicity. The closest example is CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, which has a similar structure with additional methyl groups.

Considering these comparisons, the predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O should be slightly lower than 46.9328 due to having fewer methyl groups than CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, but higher than 29.7716 due to the presence of the methyl group compared to phenol.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O is approximately 40.0.

- Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 48.1468.

The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a biphenyl with four chlorine atoms, similar to the second example, which has a property value of 81.938. The structure of the molecule in question is less complex than the second example but more complex than the first example, which has three chlorine atoms and a property value of 76.928.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl would likely be slightly lower than 81.938 but higher than 76.928. A reasonable estimate would be around 79.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are likely related to molecular size, complexity, and possibly boiling points or similar physical properties.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a relatively small and simple hydrocarbon with a branched structure. Comparing it to similar small hydrocarbons in the examples:

- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (45.268)
- CCCCCCCC=C (48.19)
- CCCCCCCC (39.05)

These examples suggest that smaller, less complex hydrocarbons tend to have lower property values. Given that isoprene is smaller and less complex than the examples listed above, we can predict a property value slightly lower than these examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around 35.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule ClCCl is dichloromethane, a small and simple molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a central carbon atom.

Looking at the examples, smaller and simpler molecules tend to have lower property values. For instance, ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of 30.438, and it is a more complex molecule than ClCCl due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and a double bond. Similarly, Oc1cccc(Cl)c1 has a property value of 33.1168, and it is also more complex than ClCCl.

Given the simplicity and small size of ClCCl, we can predict that its property value will be lower than those of the more complex chlorinated compounds listed. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around 20.0.

The molecule in question, Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, is similar in structure to the example provided, with the addition of a hydroxyl group (OH) on the benzene ring. The presence of the hydroxyl group can affect the property value, typically increasing it due to additional interactions such as hydrogen bonding.

Considering the structural similarity and the effect of the hydroxyl group, the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is likely to be slightly higher than that of 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl would be approximately 45.0.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 42.39850000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ethyl ester group attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with a benzene ring and additional functional groups tend to have property values in the range of 30 to 60. For instance:
- O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 has a property value of 52.958.
- CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of 48.86.
- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of 37.8334.

Ethyl benzoate is similar in structure to these examples, with a benzene ring and an ester group. Considering the influence of the ester group and the benzene ring, the property value is likely to be in the mid to high 40s.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately 45.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 42.55300000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a physical or chemical property such as boiling point, molecular weight, or some other characteristic.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with seven carbon atoms and a bromine atom at the end. Let's compare it to similar structures in the examples:

1. CCCCCCCCO (octanol) has a property value of 35.8448.
2. Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (bromobenzene) has a property value of 51.648.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is similar to octanol in terms of the carbon chain length but has a bromine atom instead of a hydroxyl group. The presence of bromine, a heavier atom, might increase the property value compared to the alcohol.

Considering the examples, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be slightly higher than that of octanol due to the presence of bromine. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around 40.0.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 8.1428
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of organic and inorganic compounds with different functional groups and structures. The property values seem to be related to molecular size, complexity, and possibly molecular weight or some other physicochemical property.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a simple diatomic molecule with a molecular weight of 28.01 g/mol. It is much smaller and simpler than most of the molecules in the examples, which are generally larger organic compounds. The smallest property values in the examples are for small and simple molecules, such as NC(=O)N (13.7708) and CC#C (14.507).

Given the simplicity and small size of CO, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would be among the lowest in the list. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO would be slightly lower than the smallest values given, around 10.0.
