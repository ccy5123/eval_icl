True Property: -202.34722784297855
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we need to analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is relatively simple compared to some of the more complex structures in the examples. In the examples, simpler aromatic compounds with hydroxyl groups, such as phenols, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule c1ccccc1O (phenol) has a property value of -674.49075948.

Given this pattern, and considering the structural similarity of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 to phenol, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for this molecule will also be negative and similar in magnitude to that of phenol.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is approximately -674.49075948.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 contains a thiophosphate group (P(=S)(OC)O) and a substituted aromatic ring with a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) attached to it. 

Looking at the examples, we notice that molecules with a thiophosphate group, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, have a property value of -202.34722784. These examples have halogen substitutions on the aromatic ring, which might influence the property value.

The molecule in question has a thiomethyl group instead of halogens. However, the presence of the thiophosphate group and the aromatic ring suggests that it might have a similar property value to those examples with the thiophosphate group.

Therefore, based on the structural similarity to the examples with the thiophosphate group, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be -202.34722784.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size of the molecule.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to a propyl chain (CCC). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -674.49075948. However, this example is a more complex aromatic compound with multiple nitro groups.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is simpler and aliphatic, similar to CCC, which has a property value of 1214.08336706. However, the presence of the nitro group is likely to significantly lower the property value compared to a simple alkane.

Considering the influence of the nitro group and the simplicity of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be somewhere between the values for simple alkanes and more complex nitro-containing compounds. Given the examples, a predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O could be around -674.49075948, as the nitro group tends to dominate the property value in the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), an amide linkage, and a phenyl ring. Let's compare it with the examples:

1. CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O has a property value of 134.8981519. This molecule is similar in structure, containing a phosphorothioate group, an amide linkage, and a phenyl ring, but with an additional thioether and chloro group.

2. The presence of the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage in both molecules suggests that they might have similar property values, although the absence of the thioether and chloro group in the target molecule might slightly alter the value.

Given the structural similarities and the property value of the closest example, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be close to 134.8981519. However, due to the absence of the thioether and chloro group, the value might be slightly lower.

Both molecules contain a heterocyclic ring with a carbonyl group and a phenyl group, although the specific heterocyclic structure differs.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of a carbonyl group in a heterocyclic ring and the aromatic character, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C will be in a similar range to the example with a value of -438.41899366.

True Property: 741.9398354242546
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)O), an amide group (NC(C)=O), and a thioether linkage (SC). Let's compare these features with the examples:

1. Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, have a property value of -202.34722784.
2. Molecules with amide groups, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1, have a property value of -438.41899366.
3. Molecules with thioether linkages, such as CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, have a property value of 1079.18521516.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is a combination of these functional groups. The presence of the phosphorothioate and amide groups suggests a negative property value, as seen in the examples with similar groups. However, the thioether linkage might contribute to a less negative or even positive value.

Considering the balance of these features, the property value is likely to be negative but not as low as the most negative examples. A reasonable prediction, considering the influence of the phosphorothioate and amide groups, would be around -200 to -300.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is approximately -250.

- Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has a property value of -674.49075948.

Given the presence of similar functional groups and the overall structure, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O will also be negative and close to those examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule is approximately -674.49075948.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: -202.34722784297855
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to analyze the patterns and trends in the given examples. The property values seem to be influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and structural features.

1. **Phosphorothioate Groups**: The molecule contains two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are also present in the molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 197.15883739.

2. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule has two aromatic rings, similar to other aromatic compounds in the list, such as Cc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 with a property value of -529.21582667.

3. **Sulfur Linkage**: The presence of sulfur linking the aromatic rings is a unique feature that might influence the property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule has similarities with those having positive property values due to the phosphorothioate groups, but also with those having negative values due to the aromatic and sulfur-containing structure. Balancing these influences, the property value is likely to be closer to the positive range but not as high as 197.15883739 due to the additional aromatic and sulfur features.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 would be around 0.0, as it balances the positive influence of the phosphorothioate groups with the negative influence of the aromatic and sulfur-containing structure.

True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a nitrophenol, which is similar to some of the examples provided.

Looking at the examples, we have:
- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which is a nitrobenzene, with a property value of -404.69445569.
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, which is a chlorinated phenol, with a property value of -674.49075948.
- Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, which is a chlorinated aniline, with a property value of -674.49075948.

The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is a nitrophenol, which is structurally similar to nitrobenzene but with an additional hydroxyl group. The presence of the nitro group suggests a property value similar to that of nitrobenzene, but the hydroxyl group may influence the value.

Given the examples and the structural similarities, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be close to that of nitrobenzene, but slightly more negative due to the additional hydroxyl group. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -450.0.

The molecule you provided, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, is a complex carbohydrate structure, likely a polysaccharide or a similar sugar derivative. 

From the examples given, it seems that molecules with a high degree of hydroxylation and complex carbohydrate structures, such as sugars, tend to have a property value of 1214.08336706. This is consistent with the examples like C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, which is a sugar alcohol, and other similar structures.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the given molecule is 1214.08336706.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 269.7963037906381
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we need to analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly involving factors like molecular weight, functional groups, and overall molecular complexity.

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne with a terminal triple bond, known as 1-butyne. It is a relatively simple molecule compared to some of the more complex structures in the examples. The examples with simple linear or slightly branched alkanes and alkenes, such as CCCC(O)CCC and CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO, have high positive property values, while more complex aromatic or heterocyclic structures tend to have negative values.

Given the simplicity of CCC#C and its similarity to linear alkanes, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value, but likely lower than those of longer alkanes or alkenes due to its smaller size.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around 741.93983542, similar to other small, simple molecules like CC(C)OC=O.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
- An ether linkage (O)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring with three chlorine atoms

From the examples, we observe that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms on an aromatic ring, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl and Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, have a property value of -674.49075948. This suggests that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms on an aromatic ring significantly influences the property value, often resulting in a negative value.

Additionally, the presence of a phosphorothioate group (P=S) in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 197.15883739, indicates that this group can contribute positively to the property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to have a property value influenced by both the negative contribution of the chlorinated aromatic ring and the positive contribution of the phosphorothioate group. However, the strong negative influence of the chlorinated aromatic ring is expected to dominate.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be close to the values observed for similar chlorinated aromatic compounds, which is -674.49075948.

In the examples provided, molecules with aromatic rings and nitrogen-containing functional groups often have a property value of -674.49075948. This value appears frequently for molecules with aromatic rings and heteroatoms like nitrogen, sulfur, or halogens.

Given this pattern, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is likely to be -674.49075948.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to analyze the patterns and trends from the given examples. The property values seem to be influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, molecular size, and possibly the presence of specific atoms or structural motifs.

1. **Presence of Sulfur and Phosphorus**: The molecule contains both sulfur and phosphorus, which are present in some of the examples with high property values (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1 with a value of -44.96605063).

2. **Amide Group**: The molecule contains an amide group (C(=O)N), which is also present in some examples with varying property values.

3. **Cyclohexane Ring**: The presence of a cyclohexane ring (N1CCCCC1) is a structural feature that might influence the property value. In the examples, cyclic structures have been associated with both high and low property values.

4. **Alkyl Chains**: The molecule has several alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC), which are common in molecules with higher property values.

Considering these factors, the molecule has a combination of features that are associated with both high and low property values in the examples. However, the presence of sulfur and phosphorus, along with the cyclic amide structure, suggests a property value that is not extremely high or low.

Based on the analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around -44.96605063, as it shares some structural similarities with the example COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1.

- CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 915.88745234.

The molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C has a similar level of complexity and functional groups as these examples. Given the presence of the hydroxyl group and the alkyne, which might slightly alter the property, the value is likely to be in a similar range but possibly slightly lower due to the presence of the alkyne group, which is less common in the examples.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C would be around 800.0.

However, we can observe that simpler molecules or those with fewer atoms tend to have property values that are less extreme (closer to zero) compared to more complex molecules.

Given that CO is a simple diatomic molecule, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would be relatively close to zero compared to the more complex molecules in the examples. Based on this reasoning, a plausible prediction for the property value of CO would be around 0.
