SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.5768977871024343
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the patterns from the given examples. The examples show that molecules with long carbon chains, especially those with alcohol or ester groups, tend to have positive property values. For instance, CCCCCCC(C)O has a property value of 0.77764813, and CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of 0.6098437.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is similar to CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, but with one additional carbon in the chain. Given the trend that longer carbon chains with ester groups tend to have positive values, and considering the slight decrease in the property value from CCCCCCC(C)O to CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can predict a slightly lower positive value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC compared to CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be slightly less than 0.6098437, perhaps around 0.55.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxygen and a nitrogen atom. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings and heteroatoms.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with aromatic rings and heteroatoms, such as nitrogen and oxygen, tend to have property values around 0.0. For instance, the molecule c1cncnc1 has a property value of 0.0, and Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl also has a property value of 0.0.

Given the structural similarity of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 to these examples, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be around 0.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is 0.0.

True Property: 0.7776481338173168
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is a nitro compound, specifically 2-nitropropane.

From the examples, we can observe that nitro compounds tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO has a property value of -1.20069231. This suggests that the presence of a nitro group contributes to a negative property value.

Considering the structure of CC(C)N(=O)=O and its similarity to other nitro compounds in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and similar to other nitro compounds.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is approximately -1.20069231.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO

This molecule is a polycyclic compound with multiple rings and carbonyl groups. It resembles steroid-like structures, which are often complex and have multiple fused rings. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Polycyclic Structure**: The molecule has a fused ring system, similar to steroids. This is a common feature in some of the examples provided, such as CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C, which has a property value of 0.31501908.

2. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains carbonyl groups (C=O), which are present in several examples. These groups can influence the property value, often contributing to a more negative value due to their polar nature.

3. **Hydroxyl Group**: The presence of an -OH group (hydroxyl) can also affect the property value, potentially making it more negative due to increased polarity.

4. **Overall Structure**: The complexity and size of the molecule, along with the presence of multiple rings and functional groups, suggest that the property value might be slightly negative or close to zero, as seen in similar complex structures.

Considering these factors and comparing with the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.2 to -0.3. Given the closest example with a similar structure and functional groups, a specific prediction could be:

**Predicted Property Value: -0.21043824**

True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A benzene ring with two fluorine atoms (Fc1cccc(F)c1).
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N).
- A benzene ring with a chlorine atom (c2ccc(Cl)cc2).

From the examples:
- Molecules with halogenated benzene rings, such as Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1 and Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, have a property value of 0.0.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O, have a property value of -0.18437602.

The presence of both halogenated benzene rings and an amide linkage suggests that the property value might be influenced by both features. However, the examples with halogenated benzene rings consistently have a property value of 0.0, which might dominate the prediction.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 is 0.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the patterns and trends from the given examples. The examples show that molecules with similar structures, particularly those with alkyl chains and ether groups, tend to have positive property values around 0.77764813. 

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is an ether with a simple alkyl chain, similar to other molecules in the list that have positive property values. Based on this pattern, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is likely to be 0.77764813.

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: -0.7691403623505102
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Alkyl Chain**: The molecule has a propyl group (CCC(C)) attached to the pyrrole ring. Alkyl chains generally contribute positively to the property value, as seen in examples like CCC(C)CC and CCC(C)CCO, both of which have positive property values.

2. **Pyrrole Ring**: The presence of a pyrrole ring, which is a five-membered aromatic heterocycle containing nitrogen, can influence the property value. In the examples, heterocycles like pyrrole and thiophene (e.g., Nc1nccs1) have a property value of 0.0.

3. **Carbonyl Groups**: The molecule has two carbonyl groups (C=O) attached to the pyrrole ring. Carbonyl groups can have varying effects on the property value, often contributing negatively due to their electron-withdrawing nature. For instance, molecules with carbonyl groups like CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 have negative property values.

4. **Bromine Atom**: The presence of a bromine atom (Br) can also affect the property value. In the examples, molecules with halogens like bromine or chlorine often have negative property values, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1.

Considering these factors, the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O has structural features that suggest a negative property value. The combination of the pyrrole ring, carbonyl groups, and bromine atom likely results in a negative contribution, despite the presence of the alkyl chain.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.5. This accounts for the negative influence of the carbonyl groups and bromine, offset by the positive contribution of the alkyl chain. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

-0.5

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups, aromaticity, and the overall complexity of the molecule. The molecule in question, c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, is biphenyl, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. 

In the examples, molecules with purely aromatic structures, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tend to have a property value of 0.0. For instance, the molecules "c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67" and "Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34" both have a property value of 0.0. These examples suggest that purely aromatic structures without additional functional groups or heteroatoms tend to have a property value of 0.0.

Given that biphenyl is a simple aromatic compound without additional functional groups, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be 0.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 is 0.0.

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.7776481338173168
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that aliphatic hydrocarbons, particularly those with simple alkyl chains, tend to have a property value of approximately 0.77764813. This is evident in molecules like C1CCC2CCCCC2C1, CC(C)I, CCC1CCCCC1, and CCCCCCC(C)C, which all have similar structures and property values around 0.77764813.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear alkyl chain with a sulfur atom at the end. The presence of sulfur might slightly alter the property value compared to a pure hydrocarbon chain, but given the examples, the influence of a single heteroatom like sulfur in a simple alkyl chain might not drastically change the property value from the typical hydrocarbon value.

Therefore, based on the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for CCCCCS is likely to be close to 0.77764813.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a property value of -0.27273336.
- Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (another naphthalene derivative) has a property value of -0.83011789.
- C1Cc2ccccc2C1 (a bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a property value of -3.5964555.

The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is similar to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, which is also a naphthalene derivative. Given the structural similarity, we can expect the property value to be close to that of Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, which is -0.83011789.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately -0.83011789.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C", we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic imide, similar to the example "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C" which has a property value of -3.90742738. The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the new molecule.

The presence of additional alkyl groups typically increases the hydrophobicity of a molecule, which might affect the property value. However, given the significant negative property value of the similar cyclic imide example, it is likely that the core structure of the cyclic imide has a dominant influence on the property.

Therefore, considering the structural similarity and the influence of the cyclic imide core, the predicted property value for "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C" is likely to be close to that of the similar example. Thus, the predicted property value is:

To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached. In the examples, aromatic compounds with halogen substituents, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1 and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, have a property value of 0.0. These examples suggest that aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have a property value of 0.0.

Given that trifluoromethyl is a strong electron-withdrawing group similar to halogens, and considering the pattern observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is also 0.0.

In the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and a relatively simple structure, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a property value of 0.77764813. The molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is similar in that it is a polyol with multiple hydroxyl groups and a cyclic structure, which is characteristic of sugars.

Therefore, based on the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is likely to be 0.77764813.

This molecule is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Cyclic Structure**: The molecule contains multiple fused rings, similar to some of the examples provided, such as CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of 0.33997362.

2. **Functional Groups**: The presence of ketone groups (C=O) and an ester group (CC(=O)O) is notable. These groups are also present in some of the examples, such as CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O, which has a property value of -0.18437602.

3. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The molecule also contains hydroxyl groups (C3(O) and C(O)), which can influence the property value. The presence of hydroxyl groups is seen in some examples, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, which has a property value of 0.77764813.

Considering the structural similarities and the presence of functional groups, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is influenced by both the cyclic structure and the functional groups. The presence of multiple rings and functional groups suggests a property value that is not too high or too low, likely around the middle range of the examples provided.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately:

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of multiple cyclohexane rings and a ketone group, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O will be close to -0.18437602.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O is approximately -0.18437602.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is an acetanilide derivative with a nitro group attached to the aromatic ring. This structure is similar to other nitroaromatic compounds in the examples, such as O=N(=O)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of 0.0, and COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which has a property value of -0.67449076.

The presence of the nitro group (N(=O)=O) is a significant factor in determining the property value, as it is a strong electron-withdrawing group. The acetamide group (CC(=O)N) is also present, which can influence the property value by providing some electron-donating character through resonance.

Considering the examples, the presence of the nitro group tends to lower the property value, as seen in COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O. However, the acetamide group may moderate this effect slightly compared to a simple nitrobenzene.

Based on these considerations, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is likely to be slightly negative, similar to COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately -0.67449076.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- An organophosphorus group (P=O and P=S bonds).
- An aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A thioether linkage (S-C).
- An ester linkage (C=O and O-C).

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents (e.g., Cl) often have a property value of 0.0.
- Molecules with complex heterocyclic structures and additional functional groups (e.g., esters, thioethers) tend to have negative property values.

Given these observations, the presence of the organophosphorus group, the thioether linkage, and the aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent suggests a property value that is likely negative but not extremely so, as seen in some of the more complex structures.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be around -0.5.

From the examples, we observe that simple esters and alcohols tend to have a property value of approximately 0.77764813. For instance, molecules like CCC(C)C, CC(C)O, and CCCCCCCO all have this property value. These molecules are either simple alcohols or esters with relatively small and non-complex structures.

Given that CC(C)OC=O is a simple ester, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar to those of other simple esters and alcohols in the examples. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O is 0.77764813.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 is a symmetrical structure with two phenyl rings connected by a urea linkage. This structure is similar to other aromatic compounds in the examples, particularly those with amide or urea linkages.

From the examples, we observe that aromatic compounds with amide linkages, such as CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1 (-2.42535931) and CN(C)C=Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1C (-2.42535931), tend to have negative property values. Additionally, compounds with symmetrical aromatic structures, such as c1ccncc1 (0.0) and c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3 (0.0), often have property values around zero.

Considering the symmetrical nature and the presence of the urea linkage, which is similar to an amide, the property value is likely to be close to zero or slightly negative. However, given the examples, a value of exactly zero is plausible for symmetrical aromatic compounds without additional electron-withdrawing or donating groups.

Therefore, the predicted property value for O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 is 0.0.

True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 contains:
- A sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O)), which is a common feature in some of the examples with negative property values.
- An aromatic ring with an amine substituent, similar to some structures with a property value of 0.0.
- A guanidine group (NC(=N)N), which is a polar and potentially basic functional group.

From the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and polar functional groups, such as nitro or sulfonamide groups, tend to have negative property values. The presence of the sulfonamide and guanidine groups suggests a potential for a negative property value due to their polar nature.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 would be around -1.0, as it shares similarities with other molecules that have negative property values due to their polar and aromatic characteristics.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with property values around 0.0.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) attached to the aromatic ring, which can influence the electronic properties of the molecule.
- An alkene group (C=C) in the side chain, which is not prominently featured in the examples but can affect the overall property.

From the examples, molecules with nitro groups on aromatic rings often have property values around 0.0, such as Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O and Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group might slightly alter this, but not drastically.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O is likely to be close to 0.0. However, due to the additional electron-withdrawing effects of the trifluoromethyl group and the presence of two nitro groups, a slight deviation from 0.0 might be expected.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value could be around -0.2.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the patterns from the given examples. The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, similar to some of the other molecules in the list. 

Looking at the examples, we see that simple esters and alcohols tend to have positive property values, often around 0.38253832 or 0.44676617. For instance, CC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of 0.38253832, and CCCCCOC(=O)C has a property value of 0.44676617. These examples suggest that esters with relatively simple structures tend to have property values in this range.

Given the structure of CC(C)OC=O, which is a relatively simple ester, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar to those of other simple esters in the list. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O is approximately 0.38253832.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -1.591215232982005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to the structure of toluene with an additional hydroxyl group. In the examples, molecules with phenolic groups or nitro groups tend to have negative property values, while simple hydrocarbons and halogenated compounds often have positive or zero values.

Given the presence of the hydroxyl group, which can contribute to a more negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature and potential for hydrogen bonding, and the methyl groups, which are electron-donating, we can expect a property value that is negative but not as extreme as those with multiple electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups.

Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be around -0.67449076, similar to other aromatic compounds with electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups.

To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)O), which is present in several examples with a property value of -1.59121523. Additionally, the molecule has a substituted aromatic ring with a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C), which are similar to some of the structures in the examples.

Given the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the similarity in substitution patterns on the aromatic ring, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 will be similar to those examples with the phosphorothioate group.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is -1.59121523.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that molecules with a high degree of chlorination, particularly those with multiple chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings, tend to have a property value of 0.0. This is consistent with the examples such as "Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl" and "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl," both of which have a property value of 0.0.

The molecule "Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl" is highly chlorinated and consists of aromatic rings, similar to the examples with a property value of 0.0. Therefore, the predicted property value for this molecule is 0.0.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.7776481338173168
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular size and shape.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to a propyl chain (CCC). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative property values, likely due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group, which can affect the overall electronic properties of the molecule.

For instance, the molecule CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.8875378, and it contains nitro groups. Similarly, O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.0, but it is a more complex aromatic system with multiple nitro groups.

Given that CCCN(=O)=O is a relatively simple aliphatic molecule with a single nitro group, we can expect its property value to be negative, but not as negative as more complex or highly substituted nitro compounds.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around -0.5.

- Molecules with a single halogen substituent on a benzene ring, such as Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, have a property value of 0.0.
- The presence of multiple halogens on a benzene ring, as in Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, also results in a property value of 0.0.

Given that Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar in structure to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, which has a property value of 0.0, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 will also be 0.0. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is 0.0.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with an additional hydroxyl group, which is similar to a norbornane derivative with a hydroxyl group.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar structural features and functional groups, such as small cyclic or bicyclic structures with alcohol groups, tend to have property values around 0.77764813. For instance, CC1CCCO1 and CCCCCCC(C)O both have this property value, and they are relatively simple cyclic or linear alcohols.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC) and a cyclic imide structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O). This structure is somewhat similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of -2.10929072. The main difference is the presence of a sulfur atom in the example, which is replaced by a nitrogen atom in the target molecule.

Considering the structural similarity and the fact that the sulfur atom in the example might contribute to a more negative property value, we can predict that the target molecule will have a slightly less negative property value than -2.10929072.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be approximately -1.8.

This structure is somewhat similar to the example Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of -0.56875632. Both molecules contain aromatic rings and a carbonyl group attached to a nitrogen in a heterocyclic structure.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of aromatic rings and a carbonyl group in a heterocyclic context, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C will be close to -0.56875632.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is approximately -0.56875632.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include various types of hydrocarbons, halogenated compounds, and other functional groups, with their property values ranging from negative to positive.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, also known as 1,3-butadiene. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons like CCC(C)(C)CC and C1CCCC1 have positive property values (0.77764813), while more complex or functionalized hydrocarbons tend to have negative values.

Given that C=CCC=C is a relatively simple hydrocarbon without additional functional groups or halogens, it is reasonable to predict a property value similar to other simple hydrocarbons. Therefore, the predicted property value for C=CCC=C is likely to be positive and close to the values of other simple hydrocarbons.

- A thioester linkage (SC(CCl))
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl)
- A cyclic imide structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)

From the examples, we observe:
- Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br, F) often have a property value of 0.0, especially when they are aromatic or have multiple halogens.
- Molecules with complex cyclic structures and additional functional groups (like imides or thioesters) tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of a phosphorothioate group, as seen in "COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1", which has a property value of -1.61225057, suggests a negative property value.

Considering these observations, the presence of the phosphorothioate group, the cyclic imide, and the chlorinated carbon, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value. Given the structural complexity and the presence of these groups, a reasonable prediction would be a property value similar to other complex molecules with negative values.

Therefore, the predicted property value for "CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O" is approximately -1.5.

2. **Comparison with Examples:**
   - Molecules with chloro-substituted aromatic rings often have a property value of 0.0, indicating a neutral effect.
   - The presence of a nitro group tends to lower the property value, as seen in examples with negative values.
   - The amide group is present in molecules with both positive and negative values, suggesting it may not be the dominant factor.

3. **Overall Prediction:**
   - Considering the combination of a chloro-substituted aromatic ring and a nitro group, the property value is likely to be negative.
   - The tert-butyl group may slightly offset the negativity, but the overall influence of the nitro group is expected to dominate.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be around -0.5.

The molecule "CC/C=C\C" is a linear alkene, specifically 2-pentene. In the examples, the molecule "CC/C=C/C" (2-butene) has a property value of -0.50341541. Given that 2-pentene is structurally similar to 2-butene but with an additional methylene group, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for 2-pentene would be slightly different but in the same range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for "CC/C=C\C" (2-pentene) is approximately -0.50341541.

From the examples, we observe that simple aliphatic alcohols and ethers, such as CC(C)O and CCC(O)CC, have a property value of approximately 0.77764813. This suggests that the presence of an ether or alcohol group in a relatively simple aliphatic chain tends to result in a positive property value around this number.

Given that CCCOCC is a simple ether, similar to the alcohols and ethers in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be close to 0.77764813.

- CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23 has a property value of 0.6098437, which is an exception due to its unique structure.

Given the structure of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, it is similar to the first example with a negative property value. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for this molecule as well.

Considering the examples and the structural features, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be approximately -0.56875632, similar to the example with a similar structure.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-)
- A bromobenzene ring (c1ccc(Br)cc1)

From the examples:
- Molecules with a benzene ring and a halogen (e.g., Fc1cccc(Br)c1, Clc1cccc(Cl)c1, c1(Br)c(Br)cc(Br)cc1) have a property value of 0.0.
- Molecules with an acetamide group (e.g., CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2) have a negative property value, specifically -0.98321673.

The presence of the acetamide group, which tends to lower the property value, combined with the bromobenzene ring, which typically has a neutral effect (0.0), suggests that the property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 will be negative but not as low as the example with the acetamide group alone.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around -0.67449076, similar to other molecules with a benzene ring and a substituent that lowers the property value.

Both molecules contain a benzene ring and an alkyl chain, but CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 has an additional methyl group compared to CCc1ccc(C)cc1.

Considering the structural similarity and the influence of the additional methyl group, the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is likely to be close to that of CCc1ccc(C)cc1, but slightly less negative due to the increased hydrophobicity from the additional methyl group. Therefore, I would predict the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 to be approximately -3.0.

Additionally, molecules with nitro groups or halogens tend to have property values closer to 0.0 when they are part of an aromatic system.

Given that benzaldehyde is a simple aromatic compound with an aldehyde group, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be close to 0.0, similar to other simple aromatic compounds in the examples.

- Molecules with complex aromatic systems and additional functional groups, such as COc2ccc(Oc1ccc(NC(=O)N(C)C)cc1)cc2, have negative property values.

Considering these observations, the presence of the nitro group and the overall complexity of the molecule suggest a negative property value. However, the specific value would depend on the exact influence of these groups and the overall molecular structure.

Given the trends in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.67449076, as it shares similarities with other molecules that have this property value.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several functional groups and structural features that can influence its property value:

1. **Ester Groups (COC(=O))**: The presence of ester groups is common in several molecules with negative property values, such as CC(=O)C3CCC4C2CC=C1CC(O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C (0.44676617) and CCCCCC(=O)OC (-0.18437602).

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The nitro group is known to contribute to negative property values, as seen in molecules like CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O (-0.8875378) and Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-0.67449076).

3. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: Aromatic rings are present in many molecules with both positive and negative property values. However, when combined with nitro groups, they tend to skew the property value negatively.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring (C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1...))**: The presence of a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen can also influence the property value, often contributing to a more negative value, as seen in CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O (-2.61781273).

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of both ester and nitro groups, along with the aromatic and heterocyclic rings, suggests a negative property value. The combination of these features, particularly the nitro group on the aromatic ring, is a strong indicator of a negative property value.

Based on the analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately -1.5.

The molecule you provided, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, is a complex sugar-like structure with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, resembling polysaccharides or complex carbohydrates.

From the examples, molecules with similar complex, polyhydroxylated structures, such as C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, have a property value of 0.77764813. This suggests that the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and a cyclic structure contributes to a higher property value.

Therefore, based on the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for the molecule OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O is likely to be 0.77764813.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -1.2006923062727917
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and structural features.

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne. In the examples, molecules with simple linear or branched alkane or alkene structures, such as CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO and CCCCCCC=O, have positive property values around 0.287 to 0.777. However, the presence of a triple bond (as in alkynes) is not directly represented in the examples, but we can infer that it might have a similar effect to a double bond, potentially slightly reducing the property value compared to a saturated alkane.

Given this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be slightly lower than that of a simple alkane or alkene, but still positive. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.287 for CCC#C.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: -2.776027317655544
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -1.61225057.
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 0.0.

Considering these structural similarities, the presence of the phosphorothioate group, and the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be influenced by the negative contribution of the phosphorothioate group and the neutral contribution of the chlorinated aromatic ring.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately -1.61225057, similar to the example with a similar phosphorothioate group.

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we can analyze the patterns and trends from the given examples. The examples suggest that molecules with certain functional groups or structural features tend to have specific property values.

1. Molecules with simple aromatic rings, such as benzene derivatives, often have a property value of 0.0.
2. Molecules with aliphatic chains or certain halogenated compounds often have positive property values, such as 0.77764813.
3. Molecules with more complex functional groups, such as carbonyls, amides, or nitro groups, often have negative property values.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 contains a pyridine ring (a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring) and a hydrazide group (C(=O)NN). The presence of the pyridine ring suggests a potential for a property value of 0.0, similar to other simple aromatic systems. However, the hydrazide group introduces additional complexity, which might lead to a negative property value, as seen in other examples with carbonyl and nitrogen-containing functional groups.

Considering these factors, the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is likely to have a property value close to 0.0 due to the aromatic nature of the pyridine ring, but slightly negative due to the presence of the hydrazide group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is approximately -0.1.

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 0.6225646891704604
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Several alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with sulfur-containing groups like CCS and CCBr have a property value of 0.77764813.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, have a property value of 0.28701204.
- Molecules with complex ring structures and multiple functional groups tend to have negative property values, such as CCN2c1cc(N(C)C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23 with -2.29508708.

Considering the presence of both sulfur and an amide group, along with the complexity of the structure, the property value is likely to be influenced by the sulfur-containing groups, which tend to have positive values, and the amide linkage, which can contribute to a less positive or slightly negative value.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be slightly positive, but not as high as 0.77764813. A value around 0.2 to 0.3 seems plausible.

Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately:

0.28701204

Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the property value of 0.77764813 is associated with molecules that are simple aliphatic alcohols or alkanes. The molecule CCCCCCCC is a straight-chain alkane (octane), which is similar in nature to other alkanes and alcohols that have been assigned the property value of 0.77764813. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCC is 0.77764813.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbon-carbon triple bond (C#C). The presence of multiple rings and a hydroxyl group suggests some similarity to the steroid-like structures in the examples, such as CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO and CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, which have property values of 0.05090986 and 0.40656693, respectively.

The presence of the carbon-carbon triple bond (C#C) introduces a degree of unsaturation and potential for a different electronic environment compared to the fully saturated rings. However, the overall structure still resembles the polycyclic systems with hydroxyl groups.

Considering these factors, the property value is likely to be slightly positive, similar to the other polycyclic structures with hydroxyl groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C would be around 0.1.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings. Let's break down the key features:

1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains aromatic rings, similar to many of the examples provided. Aromatic rings are often associated with a property value of 0.0, as seen in several examples.

2. **Ether and Ester Linkages**: The presence of ether (COC) and ester (COC=O) linkages is common in molecules with positive property values, such as CCCCCOCCO (0.77764813) and COP(=O)(OC)OC(Br)C(Cl)(Cl)Br (0.77764813).

3. **Polycyclic Structure**: The molecule has a complex polycyclic structure, which is similar to some examples with negative property values, such as C1Cc2ccccc2C1 (-3.5964555) and Cc1c(C)c2c3ccccc3ccc2c4ccccc14 (-0.43367645).

4. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains methoxy (OC) and hydroxyl (OH) groups, which are often associated with negative property values, as seen in COc1ccccc1Cl (-0.67449076) and OCc1ccccc1 (-0.67449076).

Considering these features, the molecule's complex structure and the presence of both positive and negative contributing factors, it is likely to have a negative property value. However, the presence of multiple ether and ester linkages suggests it might not be as negative as some of the more complex polycyclic structures.

Based on the analysis and comparison with the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.56875632, similar to other molecules with ester linkages and aromatic rings.

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property value is influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and structural features. Molecules with halogens like Cl, Br, and I attached to aromatic rings often have a property value of 0.0. For the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, which is a chlorophenol, the presence of both a hydroxyl group (OH) and a chlorine atom on a benzene ring suggests a similarity to other halogenated aromatic compounds in the examples.

Given this pattern, the predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is likely to be 0.0.

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -0.9396679417484032
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C), which is a linear and relatively non-polar group.
- An ester linkage (OC(=O)), which is polar and can contribute to a more negative property value.
- An amide group (NC(=O)), which is also polar and can contribute to a more negative property value.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1), which is similar to the chlorinated aromatic rings in the examples with a property value of 0.0.

The presence of polar functional groups like the ester and amide suggests a more negative property value, while the chlorinated aromatic ring suggests a value closer to 0.0. Balancing these factors, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is negative but not extremely so.

Based on the examples, particularly those with similar functional groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2).
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with phenyl rings and halogen substituents often have a property value of 0.0.
- The presence of additional functional groups like carbonyls, nitro groups, or complex heterocycles tends to result in negative property values.
- Simple hydrocarbons or molecules with only halogen substituents often have a property value of 0.77764813.

The molecule in question has a combination of aromatic rings, halogen substituents, and a pyrimidine ring. The presence of the pyrimidine ring, which is a heterocycle, might suggest a deviation from the 0.0 value seen in simpler aromatic halogenated compounds.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative due to the heterocyclic pyrimidine ring, but not as negative as those with multiple electron-withdrawing groups or complex functionalities.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl is approximately -0.27273336, similar to other molecules with heterocyclic components and halogenated aromatic rings.

From the examples, we can observe that simple aromatic compounds with hydroxyl groups, such as phenol derivatives, tend to have a property value of 0.0. For instance, Oc1cccc(O)c1 and Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O both have a property value of 0.0. These examples suggest that the presence of a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring is associated with a property value of 0.0.

Therefore, based on the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is 0.0.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.5034154059594502
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular size and shape.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a small hydrocarbon with a double bond and a branched structure. In the examples, small hydrocarbons with similar structures, such as alkanes and alkenes, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCC (octane) has a property value of 0.77764813, and CCCCCCCCCC=C (nonene) has a property value of 0.28701204.

Given that isoprene is a small, branched alkene, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value, likely closer to the lower end of the positive range due to its smaller size compared to the longer alkanes and alkenes in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C is approximately 0.3.

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and hydroxyl groups. It resembles some of the more complex structures in the examples, particularly those with multiple rings and oxygen-containing functional groups.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with complex polycyclic structures and multiple oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have negative property values. For instance:

- O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 has a property value of -2.93584577.
- O=C1N(COC(=O)CCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 has a property value of -1.59121523.
- CCN2c1cc(OC)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23 has a property value of -1.59121523.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen atoms, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for the given molecule. Considering the structural similarities to the examples with negative values, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -1.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 is approximately -1.5.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of a sulfur atom (S) and a tert-butyl group suggests that the molecule might have a property value similar to those with similar functional groups.

From the examples, we can see that molecules with sulfur-containing groups, such as CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1, have negative property values. Additionally, molecules with tert-butyl groups, such as CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C, also have negative property values.

Considering these observations, the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is likely to have a negative property value. Based on the examples and the structural similarities, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.05, similar to CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C, which has a property value of -0.04980785.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

In the examples, simple aliphatic chains like CCCCCCCCO and CCCCCCCCOC(=O) have positive property values (0.77764813 and 0.52780629, respectively). The presence of a bromine atom in aromatic compounds like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 results in a property value of 0.0.

Given that CCCCCCCBr is a simple aliphatic chain with a bromine atom, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be similar to other simple aliphatic chains with halogen atoms. The presence of the bromine atom might slightly reduce the property value compared to a similar chain without it, but it is unlikely to result in a negative value based on the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr is around 0.77764813, similar to other simple aliphatic chains with halogen atoms.

Carbon monoxide is a small, simple diatomic molecule without any complex functional groups. In the examples, small and simple molecules like CCC (propane) and CCBr (bromoethane) have a property value of 0.77764813. Given the simplicity and small size of CO, it is reasonable to predict that it would have a similar property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CO is 0.77764813.
