The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with an alkyl chain. It is similar in structure to other small aliphatic ethers and alcohols in the examples, such as CCCCCCO (hexanol) with a property value of -0.29227969 and CCCCCC1CCCC1 (cyclohexane derivative) with a property value of 0.79964377. The presence of the ether group (C-O-C) typically contributes to a more negative property value compared to purely aliphatic hydrocarbons.

Considering the examples, the presence of the ether group in CCCOC(C)C suggests a property value that is likely negative but not as negative as some of the more polar or functionalized molecules. It is also less negative than the highly polar or aromatic compounds.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C would be around -0.3 to -0.4. Given the examples and the structural similarity to CCCCCCO, a specific prediction could be:

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol, specifically 2-methyl-2-pentanol. In the examples, we have several aliphatic and branched hydrocarbons, as well as alcohols and other functional groups. The presence of an alcohol group (OH) generally increases the polarity of the molecule, which can affect the property value.

Looking at the examples:
- CCC(C)(C)C (a similar branched hydrocarbon without the alcohol group) has a property value of -0.11975661.
- CCCC(C)(O)CC (a similar branched alcohol) has a property value of 0.00382969.

Given that CCCC(C)(C)CO is similar to CCCC(C)(O)CC but with a slightly different branching, we can expect the property value to be in a similar range, slightly positive due to the presence of the alcohol group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO would be around 0.003, similar to the example with the alcohol group.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic imide, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of 0.06215454. The main difference in the new molecule is the presence of a longer alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) attached to the cyclic imide structure.

Longer alkyl chains generally increase hydrophobicity, which can affect the property value. However, the core structure remains similar, and the examples suggest that the property values for cyclic imides with small modifications tend to be close to each other.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is likely to be slightly higher than 0.06215454 due to the increased hydrophobicity from the longer alkyl chain. A reasonable estimate would be around 0.1.

- The presence of multiple halogens, especially electronegative ones like fluorine, generally leads to more negative values.

Given these observations, the presence of the trifluoromethyl group, which is highly electronegative, is likely to result in a negative property value. Considering the trend in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around -0.7 to -0.8.

Therefore, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.75.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O

This molecule contains several notable features:

1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O):** The presence of nitro groups is known to generally decrease the property value, as seen in examples like "Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O" with a high positive value, but in other contexts, it can contribute to a negative value, such as in "Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O" with a positive value.

2. **Trifluoromethyl Group (C(F)(F)F):** The trifluoromethyl group is highly electronegative and can also contribute to a decrease in the property value. However, its effect can vary depending on the overall molecular context.

3. **Aromatic Ring:** The presence of an aromatic ring can contribute to both positive and negative property values, depending on the substituents attached to it.

4. **Alkyl Chain with Double Bond (CC(C)=C):** This feature is generally associated with a positive contribution to the property value, as seen in examples with alkyl chains.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples provided, the molecule has a combination of both positive and negative contributing factors. The presence of two nitro groups and a trifluoromethyl group suggests a significant negative contribution, while the alkyl chain with a double bond might slightly offset this.

Based on the balance of these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule is likely to be negative, but not extremely so. A reasonable estimate, considering the examples, would be around:

**-0.450**

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.28854659590023657
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. It has a relatively simple structure with a small number of carbon atoms and an ester functional group. In the examples, small esters and similar simple molecules tend to have property values close to zero or slightly positive.

For instance, the molecule CC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of -0.00018234, which is very close to zero. This suggests that small esters or similar compounds might have property values around zero.

Considering the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be close to zero. Therefore, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

0.0

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 0.5276368111337933
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples.

1. **Aromatic Compounds**: The molecule contains a benzene ring, which is a common feature in several examples. Aromatic compounds in the examples have a range of property values, but those with additional functional groups like hydroxyl (OH) tend to have negative values.

2. **Substituents**: The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) on the benzene ring is significant. In the examples, phenol (c1ccccc1O) has a property value of -0.71382269, indicating that the hydroxyl group contributes to a negative property value.

3. **Methyl Groups**: The molecule has two methyl groups (CH3) attached to the benzene ring. Methyl groups generally increase the property value, as seen in examples like CCc1ccccc1C (0.36316148) and CCc1ccccc1CC (1.00744804).

Considering these factors, the presence of the hydroxyl group is likely to have a stronger influence, leading to a negative property value, but the methyl groups will mitigate this to some extent. Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is likely to be slightly negative, but not as negative as phenol itself.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.2301461006407003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is also present in several of the examples. The examples with similar groups are:

1. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl: -0.81340038
2. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl: -0.13236549
3. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl: 0.76735261

The molecule also contains a thiomethyl group (SC) attached to a benzene ring, which is a feature not directly present in the examples. However, the presence of a benzene ring with substituents is common in the examples.

The examples with benzene rings and various substituents show a range of property values, but the presence of electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl, Br, I) tends to result in more negative values, while electron-donating groups (like alkyl groups) tend to result in more positive values.

Given that the molecule has a thiomethyl group (which is slightly electron-donating) and a methyl group on the benzene ring, it is likely to have a property value that is less negative than those with multiple halogens. However, the presence of the phosphorothioate group, which has been associated with negative values, suggests the property might still be negative.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 would be around -0.2 to -0.3. Therefore, a specific predicted value could be:

-0.25

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.9792472502354096
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound, specifically a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) derivative. The examples provided include several chlorinated aromatic compounds, such as:

1. Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, with a property value of -0.88570899
2. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, with a property value of -0.88378934
3. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, with a property value of 1.00939616

The molecule in question, Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is similar to the second example, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of -0.88378934. Both molecules are highly chlorinated biphenyls, but the molecule in question has one less chlorine atom compared to the third example, which has a positive property value.

Given the structural similarity to the second example and the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl will be close to -0.88378934. However, due to the slightly lower degree of chlorination compared to the third example, the property value might be slightly less negative.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately -0.88.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.37073441891690634
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to the end. 

In the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have positive property values, as seen with molecules like CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O (0.85358404) and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (0.22058349). However, the presence of other functional groups and the overall structure can influence the property value significantly.

Given that CCCN(=O)=O is a relatively simple molecule with a single nitro group and no other complex functional groups or aromatic systems, it is likely to have a property value that is positive but not as high as those with additional aromatic or electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 0.2.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.5428923381521296
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent. 

Looking at the examples, we have:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 with a property value of 0.80166258
- c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12 with a property value of 0.70831174

Both of these examples involve bromine-substituted aromatic rings, and they have relatively high positive property values. The presence of a fluorine atom in Fc1cccc(Br)c1 might influence the property value, but given the examples, it is likely to still result in a positive value.

Considering the structural similarity and the influence of halogen substituents, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be around 0.75.

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.35625682252999546
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with an additional methyl group and a hydroxyl group. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with cyclic and bicyclic structures.

Looking at the examples, we see that molecules with cyclic structures and alcohol groups, such as CCCCC(C)(C)O (-0.87573291) and CC(C)(C)CO (-0.29227969), tend to have negative property values. The presence of the tertiary alcohol group and the bicyclic structure in the target molecule suggests that it might have a property value in a similar range.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 would be around -0.3 to -0.5. Given the examples and the structural similarities, I would predict a specific property value of approximately:

-0.40000000

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.8544101377300932
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 1.01028477. Both molecules contain a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)), an amide linkage (N-C(=O)), and a phenyl ring (c1ccccc1). The main difference is the presence of a thioether linkage (SC(CCl)) in the example, which is absent in the molecule we are predicting.

Given the structural similarity and the absence of the thioether linkage, which might slightly reduce the property value, we can predict that the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O will be slightly lower than 1.01028477. However, it is likely to remain close to this value due to the overall structural similarity.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is approximately 1.005.

True Property: 0.5843396864194347
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzamide with an additional phenyl group attached to the nitrogen. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of 0.31364763. Both molecules contain aromatic rings and a carbonyl group attached to a nitrogen atom, which can influence the electronic distribution and, consequently, the property value.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of the aromatic and carbonyl groups, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would likely be in a similar range to the example with a value of 0.31364763. However, due to the additional methyl group and the specific arrangement of the rings, the property might be slightly different.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be approximately 0.30.

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.5254558332171928
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate. It has a long alkyl chain (heptane) and an ester functional group. In the examples, we see that long alkyl chains tend to have positive property values, as seen with CCCCC (0.93177994) and CCCCCCCCI (-0.77678944). The presence of an ester group, as in CCCCCCCC(=O)OC (-0.71237752), tends to lower the property value compared to a simple alkane.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is likely to be slightly negative, as the ester group reduces the positive influence of the long alkyl chain. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around -0.7.
==================================================
Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.9736716063874343
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is methyl benzoate, which is an ester. In the examples, we have several esters and aromatic compounds:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1, -0.88745266
2. CCOC(=O)c1cncn1C(C)c2ccccc2, -0.2274763
3. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, 0.00133464

The third example, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, is ethyl benzoate, which is very similar to methyl benzoate, differing only by one methylene group in the alkyl chain. The property value for ethyl benzoate is 0.00133464.

Given the structural similarity between methyl benzoate and ethyl benzoate, we can predict that the property value for methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1) will be very close to that of ethyl benzoate. Therefore, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately 0.00133464.

Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 1.0119026587852056
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the overall molecular structure.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear conjugated diene, which is similar to the structure of C=Cc1ccccc1 (styrene) with a property value of -0.83021382. However, C=CCC=C is a simpler structure without the aromatic ring, which might suggest a less negative or slightly positive property value due to the absence of the electron-withdrawing effect of the aromatic ring.

Considering the examples and the nature of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C would be slightly less negative than that of styrene. Therefore, I would predict a property value around -0.5 for C=CCC=C.

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.5189710079881134
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule BrC(Br)Br is tribromomethane, also known as bromoform. It is a small, highly halogenated compound.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with a high degree of halogenation, particularly with bromine and chlorine, tend to have higher property values. For instance:

- Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of 0.70831174.
- Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.97924725.
- FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br has a property value of 1.00661855.

These examples suggest that the presence of multiple halogen atoms, especially bromine and chlorine, correlates with higher property values. Given that BrC(Br)Br is a simple molecule with three bromine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a relatively high property value.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value for BrC(Br)Br to be approximately 0.95.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of -0.73380079.
- An amide linkage (N-C=O), which is present in several molecules with varying property values.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is also present in some molecules with negative property values.
- A phenyl group (c1ccccc1), which is common in many molecules with both positive and negative property values.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the chlorinated carbon suggests a tendency towards a negative property value. The amide linkage and phenyl group can contribute to either positive or negative values, but the overall structure leans towards a negative value due to the phosphorothioate and chlorinated carbon.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around -0.7, similar to the example with a phosphorothioate group. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

-0.7

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule contains several functional groups and structural elements that can influence its property value:

1. **Amide Group (CN(C)C(=O)N):** This is a common feature in several molecules with negative property values, such as CN(C)C(=O)C (-0.20354612) and CCC(=O)CC (-0.11580922).

2. **Chlorine Substituent (c(Cl)c1):** Chlorine atoms are present in molecules with both positive and negative property values. However, in many cases, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 (-0.61531117) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (-0.0333343), the presence of chlorine tends to contribute to a negative property value.

3. **Aromatic Ring (c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)):** Aromatic rings are present in molecules with a wide range of property values, but the presence of additional electron-withdrawing groups like chlorine and nitro groups often leads to negative values.

4. **Nitrogen-Containing Heterocycle (n2nc(oc2=O)):** This feature is similar to the structure in Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2 (0.54897355), which has a positive property value. However, the overall influence depends on the entire molecular context.

5. **Tert-Butyl Group (C(C)(C)C):** This bulky group is present in molecules with both positive and negative values, but its presence often contributes to steric effects that can influence the property value.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the molecule likely has a property value that is slightly negative due to the combination of electron-withdrawing groups and the amide linkage. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be around -0.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with chlorine atoms attached to each ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a property value of -0.85267184. The presence of additional chlorine atoms and the ether linkage in the target molecule could influence the property value.

Considering the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have negative property values, and the presence of an ether linkage might slightly alter this trend. However, the overall influence of the chlorine atoms is likely to dominate.

Based on these observations, I would predict that the property value for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is likely to be negative and somewhat similar to the example with two chlorines on a single phenyl ring. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.85.

The molecule CC/C=C\C is a linear alkene with four carbon atoms, similar to the example CC/C=C/C, which has a property value of 0.98920919.

Given the structural similarity, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC/C=C\C will be very close to that of CC/C=C/C. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C is approximately 0.98920919.

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.29227969420733435
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the trends and characteristics of the given examples. The molecule CCCOCC is a linear chain with an ether functional group (R-O-R').

From the examples, we can observe the following:
- Molecules with ether groups, such as CC(C)O (0.76069991) and CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (0.00133464), tend to have positive property values.
- Linear alkanes, such as CCCCCCC=C (-0.34676815) and CCCCCCCCCC(=O)C (-0.51275636), tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of an ether group in CCCOCC might increase the property value compared to a simple alkane.

Considering these observations, CCCOCC is likely to have a property value that is positive but not as high as the more complex ether-containing molecules. A reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be around 0.3.

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.9242493012115262
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

This molecule contains:
- A tertiary amide group (N(C=O)N) similar to the structure CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of -0.87294468.
- Two phenyl rings, which are common in several examples with varying property values.
- A tertiary butyl group (C(C)(C)c1ccccc1), which is a bulky substituent.

The presence of the tertiary amide and the bulky substituent suggests that the property value might be influenced by steric and electronic effects similar to those seen in other amide-containing molecules. The examples with tertiary amides and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values, often due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the amide group and the potential for resonance stabilization.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be negative and similar to other amide-containing structures. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.8, given the structural similarities to the example with a value of -0.87294468. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

-0.8

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-), which is a common feature in several molecules with varying property values.
- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1), which is similar to the structure in Fc1cccc(Br)c1 with a property value of -0.54289234 and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 with a property value of -0.67123479.

Considering the presence of the bromobenzene moiety, which tends to have negative property values in the examples, and the acetamide group, which can contribute to a range of values depending on the context, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to be negative, similar to the other bromobenzene-containing compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately -0.6.

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 1.0074480406636237
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is isopropylbenzene, also known as cumene. It consists of an isopropyl group (CC(C)) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1). 

Looking at the examples, we can find similar structures:
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 has a property value of 0.36316148. This molecule is ethylbenzene, which is similar to cumene but with an ethyl group instead of an isopropyl group.
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 has a property value of 1.00744804. This molecule is 1,3-diisopropylbenzene, which has two isopropyl groups attached to the benzene ring.

Given that cumene is structurally between ethylbenzene and 1,3-diisopropylbenzene, we can expect its property value to be between 0.36316148 and 1.00744804. Since cumene has only one isopropyl group, its property value should be closer to that of ethylbenzene.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 (cumene) would be around 0.5.

For instance, NC(=O)c1ccccc1O has a property value of 0.94413854, and ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 has a property value of 0.87088042. These examples suggest that the presence of a carbonyl group attached to an aromatic ring contributes to a positive property value.

Considering the structure of benzaldehyde and the trends observed in the examples, I would predict a positive property value for O=Cc1ccccc1. Given the examples and their values, a reasonable prediction for the property value of benzaldehyde would be around 0.8. Therefore, the predicted property value for O=Cc1ccccc1 is approximately 0.8.

To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group (N-N).

Looking at the examples, we have a similar structure: N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 0.06644878. The difference between the two structures is that the example has a double-bonded nitrogen (azo group), while the target molecule has a single-bonded nitrogen (hydrazine group).

The presence of the azo group in the example might contribute to a slightly different electronic environment compared to the hydrazine group. However, both structures are relatively similar in terms of aromaticity and overall molecular framework.

Given the similarity, we can expect the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 to be close to that of the example with the azo group. However, the hydrazine group might slightly alter the property value due to differences in electronic effects.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be slightly adjusted from the example value, potentially around 0.05.

In the examples, aromatic compounds with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have positive property values, such as Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O with a property value of 0.90664939. However, the presence of a sulfonamide group might influence the property differently compared to a nitro group.

Considering the examples, aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups tend to have positive property values, while those with electron-donating groups or less polar groups tend to have negative values. The sulfonamide group is polar and can act as an electron-withdrawing group, similar to nitro groups.

Based on this analysis, the predicted property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is likely to be positive, but not as high as the nitro-substituted benzene due to the different nature of the sulfonamide group. A reasonable estimate would be around 0.5 to 0.7.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is approximately 0.6.

The molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a pyridine ring (a benzene ring with one nitrogen atom) and a trichloromethyl group attached. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with chlorinated aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have negative property values, especially when multiple chlorine atoms are present.
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups (N(=O)=O) or additional chlorine atoms tends to decrease the property value further.

For instance:
- Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of -0.8818088.
- Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.84302421, but this is an exception due to the specific arrangement and lack of additional electron-withdrawing groups.

Given the structure Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, the presence of the pyridine nitrogen and the trichloromethyl group suggests a strong electron-withdrawing effect, likely leading to a negative property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl would be around -0.7 to -0.9. Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a specific predicted property value could be:

The molecule CCCCC(C)O is a primary alcohol with a linear alkyl chain, similar to the example molecule CCCCCCCCl, which has a property value of 1.00272464. The presence of the hydroxyl group (O) in CCCCC(C)O is similar to the alcohol group in CCC(CC)CO, which has a property value of -0.87573291. However, the chain length and branching in CCCCC(C)O are more similar to CCCCCCCCl, which is a linear chain with a terminal functional group.

Considering these structural similarities, the property value for CCCCC(C)O is likely to be closer to the positive range, similar to CCCCCCCCl, but slightly adjusted due to the presence of the hydroxyl group instead of a chlorine atom.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCC(C)O would be approximately 0.95.

1. Aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have negative property values. For instance:
   - Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl has a property value of -0.61531117.
   - ClCCl has a property value of -0.00707338.
   - ClC(Cl)Cl has a property value of 0.29150418, which is an exception but still relatively low.

2. The presence of multiple halogen atoms, especially bromine, might influence the property value. For example:
   - CI has a property value of 0.69443914, which is relatively high, but this is a single iodine atom.

Considering these observations, the presence of two bromine atoms on a benzene ring is likely to result in a property value that is negative, similar to other halogenated aromatic compounds. However, the exact value might be slightly higher than those with chlorine due to the larger size and different electronic effects of bromine compared to chlorine.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around -0.3 to -0.5. Given the examples and trends, a specific predicted property value could be:

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl is less chlorinated than the example, as it has fewer chlorine atoms. Generally, the presence of more chlorine atoms tends to decrease the property value, as seen in the examples. Therefore, we can expect the property value for this molecule to be slightly higher (less negative) than -0.72727777.

Taking this into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be around -0.6.

- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to be electron-withdrawing and can increase the molecule's polarity.
- An aromatic ring, which can contribute to stability and delocalization of electrons.
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle, which can influence the electronic properties.
- Chlorine atoms, which are also electron-withdrawing and can affect the molecule's reactivity and polarity.
- A ketone group (C=O), which is polar and can contribute to the overall dipole moment of the molecule.

Looking at the examples, molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (NO2), trifluoromethyl (CF3), and multiple halogens (Cl, Br) tend to have higher property values, often positive. The presence of aromatic rings and heterocycles can also contribute to higher values, depending on the specific substituents and their positions.

Given these considerations, the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O has several electron-withdrawing groups and a complex structure that suggests a higher property value. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.8.

True Property: -0.26247975568580245
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitrobenzene derivative with a methoxy group attached to the benzene ring. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to contribute negatively to the property value, as seen in O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-0.86552303) and Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (-0.88760868).
- Methoxy groups (CO) can have a positive influence, as seen in COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC (0.93116657).

Considering these influences, the presence of both a methoxy group and a nitro group on the benzene ring suggests a balance between the positive contribution of the methoxy group and the negative contribution of the nitro group. 

Given the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be slightly negative, reflecting the dominant influence of the nitro group. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.7.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. The molecule is a highly chlorinated compound, similar to some of the examples given, such as ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of -0.74942923.

The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in the examples. The structure of the given molecule is complex, with multiple rings and chlorine atoms, suggesting a significant electron-withdrawing effect and steric hindrance, which typically results in a more negative property value.

Considering these factors and the trends observed in the examples, I would predict the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl to be approximately -0.8.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a long-chain ester, specifically decanoate ester, which is similar to some of the other molecules in the list that contain ester groups and long carbon chains.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with ester groups and long carbon chains tend to have positive property values. For instance, CCCCC(CC)C=O has a property value of 0.9061197, and CCCOC has a property value of 0.84405744. These examples suggest that the presence of an ester group and a long carbon chain contributes to a positive property value.

Given the structure of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, which is a decanoate ester, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be positive and likely in a similar range to the examples with similar functional groups and chain lengths.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 0.85.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, have positive property values, but the presence of additional electron-withdrawing groups can influence this.
- The presence of chlorine atoms in aromatic rings often contributes to negative property values, as seen in Cl\C=C/Cl and Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O.

Considering these factors, the molecule has several electron-withdrawing groups (nitro, chloro, and amide), which are likely to result in a negative property value. The combination of these groups suggests a property value similar to other molecules with strong electron-withdrawing characteristics.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be around -0.7 to -0.8. Given the examples, a specific prediction could be -0.75.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- Two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are similar to the phosphorothioate group in the example molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -0.73380079.
- Aromatic rings connected by a sulfur atom, similar to the structure in Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, which has a property value of -0.71548704.

Both examples with phosphorothioate groups and aromatic rings with sulfur linkages tend to have negative property values. The presence of multiple phosphorothioate groups and aromatic rings in the molecule suggests that the property value will likely be negative and possibly similar to the examples with similar functional groups.

Considering these structural similarities, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 would be around -0.75.

True Property: 0.8617397869929911
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can see that molecules with nitro groups attached to aromatic rings, such as Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, have a property value of 0.94413854. Additionally, molecules with phenol groups, such as Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, have a property value of 0.52763681.

Given that Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has both a nitro group and a phenol group, we can expect its property value to be influenced by both functional groups. The presence of the nitro group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group, is likely to have a significant impact on the property value, similar to the example with a nitro group on an aromatic ring.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is likely to be close to that of the nitrobenzene example, which is 0.94413854.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. This molecule is a complex sugar, likely a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide, given its multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic acetal structures.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with extensive hydroxyl groups and cyclic structures, such as sugars, tend to have property values close to zero. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O has a property value of 0.0056207, which is very close to zero. This suggests that the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic ether linkages in sugars tends to neutralize the property value.

Given the structural similarity of the provided molecule to sugars and considering the trend observed in the examples, I would predict that the property value for OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O is also close to zero. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately:

To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne with a terminal triple bond, also known as 1-butyne.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with alkynes, such as N#Cc1ccccc1C#N, have a relatively high property value (0.90269526).
2. Linear alkanes and alkenes, such as CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO and CCCCCCCCCCCCCC=O, have property values that are either positive or negative but not extremely high or low.
3. The presence of a triple bond in a small molecule like CCC#C might suggest a property value that is not as high as aromatic systems but could be higher than simple alkanes.

Considering these observations, the property value for CCC#C is likely to be positive but not extremely high. A reasonable prediction, based on the trends observed, would be around 0.5. However, without a precise model or more specific data, this is an estimation.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCC#C is approximately 0.5.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -0.73380079.
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl, which has a property value of -0.00448868, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of -0.88378934.

Considering these structural similarities, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring tends to lower the property value, as seen in the examples. The phosphorothioate group also contributes to a lower property value.

Based on these observations, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be negative and closer to the lower end of the examples with similar features. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately -0.75.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 contains a pyridine ring (a six-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen atom) and a hydrazide group (C(=O)NN). In the examples, molecules with nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as pyridine or pyrazole, tend to have property values around -0.1 to -0.2. For instance, Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2 has a property value of -0.08509252, and c1ccccc1(OC(=O)NC) has a property value of -0.08834111.

Considering the presence of the pyridine ring and the hydrazide group, which may contribute to a similar electronic environment as seen in the examples, the property value is likely to be in the same range.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Several alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, have a property value of 0.32767975.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, have a property value of 0.00018234.
- Molecules with piperidine rings, such as C/C1CCC(\C)CC1, have a property value of -0.34676815.

Considering these observations, the presence of a phosphorothioate group might increase the property value, while the amide linkage and piperidine ring might have a neutral or slightly negative effect. The overall structure suggests a balance between these influences.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around 0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC, we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The molecule CCCCCCCC is a linear alkane, specifically octane. In the examples, we have several similar linear and branched alkanes:

- CCCCCCCCO (octanol) has a property value of 0.00382969.
- CCCCCC1CCCC1 (a cycloalkane) has a property value of 0.79964377.
- C/C1CCCCC1\C (a cycloalkane with a methyl group) has a property value of -0.34676815.
- CCC(C)C1(CC(Br)=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O (a more complex structure) has a property value of -0.70080782.
- CCC(C)C1(CC(Br)=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O (a more complex structure) has a property value of -0.70080782.
- CCCCC/C=C/C (a linear alkene) has a property value of -0.86439193.

From these examples, we can see that simple linear alkanes tend to have property values close to zero, with slight variations depending on the presence of functional groups or branching. Since CCCCCCCC is a simple linear alkane without any functional groups, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be close to that of CCCCCCCCO, which is 0.00382969.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCC is approximately 0.00382969.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves recognizing patterns and similarities with known examples. The molecule in question, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with a hydroxyl group and a triple bond.

From the examples provided, we can observe that complex polycyclic structures with oxygen-containing functional groups (like hydroxyl or carbonyl groups) tend to have positive property values. For instance, molecules such as CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C and CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO have positive property values of 1.00502679 and 0.99375459, respectively.

Given the structural complexity and the presence of a hydroxyl group, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C. Considering the examples, a value slightly below 1.0 seems plausible due to the presence of the triple bond, which might slightly reduce the property value compared to similar structures without it.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 0.95.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings. The presence of methoxy groups (OC) and hydroxyl groups (O) suggests some degree of polarity, which could influence the property value.

From the examples provided, molecules with complex polycyclic structures and multiple functional groups tend to have property values that are either moderately positive or negative, depending on the specific functional groups and their interactions.

Given the complexity and the presence of both polar and non-polar regions, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule might be around 0.5, as it balances the polar and non-polar characteristics, similar to some of the other complex structures in the examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 is approximately 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their properties. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to the nitrophenol example (Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O) with a property value of 0.86173979. However, the nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which likely contributes to a higher property value. In contrast, the chloro group is less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group.

Additionally, the molecule Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) has a property value of -0.80396597, and Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) has a property value of -0.6648188. These values suggest that halogenated benzenes tend to have negative property values.

Considering these factors, the presence of both a hydroxyl group and a chloro group on the benzene ring in Oc1ccccc1Cl suggests a property value that is likely less positive than the nitrophenol example but potentially less negative than the chlorobenzene example due to the additional hydroxyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around -0.5.

- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C)
- An ester linkage (OC(=O))
- An amide group (NC(=O))
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with chlorinated aromatic rings tend to have a wide range of property values, but often they are positive or slightly negative.
- The presence of an ester linkage (OC(=O)) in the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC has a high positive property value (0.93116657).
- Amide groups (NC(=O)) are present in molecules with both positive and negative property values, but they often contribute to a more positive value when combined with other electron-withdrawing groups.

Considering these observations, the combination of the chloroalkyne, ester, and amide groups, along with the chlorinated aromatic ring, suggests a property value that is likely to be slightly positive or close to neutral. 

Based on the structural analysis and comparison with similar molecules, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around 0.1.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2).
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have positive property values, especially when they are heavily chlorinated or brominated.
- The presence of heterocycles like pyrimidine (c2cncnc2) can influence the property value, but the effect is not as strong as halogenation.

Considering these factors, the molecule has similarities with examples like ClC(Cl)=C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 (0.51598459) and Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (0.80166258), which have positive property values due to the presence of halogens and aromatic rings.

Therefore, the predicted property value for OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl is likely to be positive and in the range of these examples. A reasonable estimate would be around 0.6 to 0.8.

The molecule CCCCCOC=O is an ester, specifically a linear alkyl ester, similar to the example molecule CCCCCCC=O, which has a property value of -0.88740305. The presence of the ester functional group (OC=O) and the linear alkyl chain suggests that the property value might be similar to other linear alkyl esters or ketones.

Considering the examples, linear alkyl chains and ester groups tend to have negative property values. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCOC=O is likely to be negative and close to the value of similar structures.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O is approximately -0.85.

   - Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of -0.88570899.

2. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings generally results in negative property values.

Given that Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a biphenyl with four chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and similar to the other highly chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is approximately -0.88.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a small hydrocarbon with a double bond and a branched structure.

From the examples, we observe that small hydrocarbons with double bonds and branching, such as CCCCCC=C (0.79964377) and CCCCC(CC)C=O (0.9061197), tend to have positive property values. These examples suggest that the presence of a double bond and branching in hydrocarbons is associated with positive property values.

Given this pattern, we can predict that the property value for CC=C(C)C will also be positive. Considering the size and structure of isoprene compared to the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around 0.8.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.007073377232951526
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

Dichloromethane is a simple molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a central carbon. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl and Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, tend to have negative property values. This suggests that the presence of chlorine atoms contributes to a negative property value.

Given the simplicity of dichloromethane compared to the more complex chlorinated compounds in the examples, we can expect its property value to be less negative than those of the more complex chlorinated compounds. However, it is still likely to be negative due to the presence of chlorine atoms.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around -0.8, considering the trend observed in the examples.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 1.0072640586337518
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can look for patterns and similarities in the given examples. The molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a chlorinated phenol, similar to the example Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a property value of 1.00726406. Both molecules have a similar structure, with a phenol ring and multiple chlorine atoms attached.

Given the structural similarity and the presence of chlorine atoms, which tend to increase the property value in the examples provided, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl will be close to that of Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is approximately 1.00726406.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.9952700507641221
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be quite complex, with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and a significant degree of oxygenation, which suggests a high degree of polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The presence of methoxy groups (OC) and hydroxyl groups (O) further increases its polarity.

Based on the examples provided, molecules with high polarity and complex structures, especially those with multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, tend to have property values that are either moderately positive or negative, depending on the specific arrangement and interactions of these groups.

Considering the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be slightly negative, reflecting the balance between its polar and non-polar components.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the given molecule is approximately:

-0.450

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.11266773770949734
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves analyzing the functional groups, molecular size, and other structural features that might influence the property in question. The examples provided suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, aromaticity, and possibly steric effects.

The molecule in question, CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, contains a thioether (CS), a pyrazole ring (nnc), a carbonyl group (c(=O)), and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of the thioether and the pyrazole ring might contribute to a moderate property value, while the carbonyl group could have a polarizing effect. The tert-butyl group introduces steric bulk, which might influence the property value as well.

Considering the examples, molecules with similar heterocyclic structures and functional groups tend to have property values around the mid-range, often slightly positive or negative depending on the specific interactions and steric effects.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C to be approximately 0.25.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.0013346449094190672
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ethyl benzoate, which is an ester formed from benzoic acid and ethanol. 

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCC(=O)OCC, which is a similar ester structure, with a property value of 0.97324168.
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2, which is a more complex molecule with an ester group, has a property value of -0.29192312.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is simpler than the second example and more similar to the first example, which is a simple ester. Given the trend that simple esters like CCCCC(=O)OCC have positive property values, it is reasonable to predict that CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 will also have a positive property value, but likely lower than 0.97324168 due to its smaller size and simpler structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around 0.5.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.21498463137913384
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom at the end. In the examples, we see that linear alkyl chains like CCCCCCCCO have a property value of 0.00382969, and Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of 0.70831174. The presence of a bromine atom in the aromatic compound significantly increases the property value.

Considering the linear alkyl chain nature of CCCCCCCBr and the influence of the bromine atom, we can expect the property value to be positive but not as high as the aromatic compound with bromine. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around 0.3 to 0.5.

Given this analysis, I would predict the property value for CCCCCCCBr to be approximately 0.35.

SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.8452055169397558
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for carbon monoxide (CO) based on the given examples is challenging due to the lack of direct correlation between the provided molecular structures and their property values. However, we can make an educated guess by considering the nature of CO and the trends observed in the examples.

Carbon monoxide is a small, simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is non-polar and has a relatively high bond energy. In the context of the examples, smaller and simpler molecules tend to have property values closer to zero, but the specific property being measured is not clear from the data provided.

Given these considerations, I would predict a property value for CO that is close to zero, but slightly negative due to its small size and simplicity. A reasonable estimate might be around -0.1.
