To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the trends and patterns from the given examples. The molecule in question is a long-chain ester, specifically a decanoate ester. 

From the examples, we observe that:
- Long-chain hydrocarbons and their derivatives tend to have negative property values.
- Esters, such as COC(=O)c1cccnc1 and CCOC(=O)CC, also have negative property values.
- The property value seems to become more negative with increasing chain length in hydrocarbons and their derivatives.

Given these observations, the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, being a long-chain ester, is expected to have a negative property value. Considering the trend of increasing negativity with longer chains, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -1.0. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is approximately -1.0.

True Property: -0.6668081805137086
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxo group and a nitrogen atom. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings, heteroatoms, and halogen substituents.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have positive or slightly negative property values.
- The presence of heteroatoms like nitrogen and oxygen, especially in a heterocyclic context, can influence the property value towards being slightly negative or positive, depending on the specific structure and substituents.

Considering these factors, the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero, given the balance of aromaticity, halogen substitution, and the presence of a heterocyclic structure with an oxo group.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around -0.1.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.46966034921842176
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O). The presence of the nitro group is significant because it is an electron-withdrawing group, which can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have negative property values. This suggests that the presence of a nitro group tends to lower the property value.

Considering the structural similarity and the influence of the nitro group, I would predict that the property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative. Based on the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.15.

Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as functional groups, molecular size, and overall molecular geometry. The examples provided suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of saturation, and the complexity of the molecular structure.

The molecule in question, CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple rings and carbonyl groups. This type of structure is similar to some of the examples provided, such as CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C, which has a property value of 1.24499507.

Given the complexity and the presence of carbonyl groups, which tend to increase the property value, I would predict that the property value for this molecule is likely to be positive and relatively high. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 1.2.

True Property: 0.7212319512258265
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A difluorobenzene moiety (Fc1cccc(F)c1), which is similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 with a property value of -0.43222344.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N), which is a common feature in several molecules with varying property values.
- A chlorobenzene moiety (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 0.0.

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like fluorine and chlorine generally tends to lower the property value, as seen in the examples. The amide linkage can also influence the property, but its effect is less straightforward without more specific examples.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, the predicted property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 is likely to be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the electron-withdrawing groups and the amide linkage.

A reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.5.

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -2.394038384354575
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with a linear chain and a branching methyl group. It is similar in structure to other small aliphatic ethers and alcohols in the examples, such as CCCCCO (0.08644175) and CCC(C)CO (-1.34935326). The presence of the ether group (C-O-C) and the branching methyl group suggests that the property value might be influenced by both the ether functionality and the overall hydrophobicity of the molecule.

Considering the examples, the property values for small ethers and alcohols tend to be close to zero or slightly negative, reflecting a balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions. Given the structure of CCCOC(C)C, it is likely to have a property value in a similar range.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C would be around -0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. Let's analyze the structural features:

1. **Presence of Bromine (Br):** In the examples, the presence of bromine generally contributes to a more negative property value. For instance, CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of -3.70723631.

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O):** Carbonyl groups are present in several examples, often contributing to a more negative property value. For example, CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 and CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 both have negative property values.

3. **Aromatic Ring:** The molecule contains a pyrrole ring, which is aromatic. Aromaticity can influence the property value, but the effect can vary depending on other substituents.

4. **Alkyl Chain (CCC(C)):** The presence of an alkyl chain can contribute to a more positive property value, as seen in some examples like C1CCCCC1 with a property value of 0.81315348.

Considering these factors, the presence of bromine and carbonyl groups suggests a more negative property value, while the alkyl chain might offset this to some extent. However, the overall influence of the bromine and carbonyl groups is likely to dominate.

Based on these considerations, I would predict a moderately negative property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O. A reasonable estimate might be around -1.5, considering the structural influences and the examples provided.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.33578757466169956
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups, aromaticity, and overall molecular complexity.

Biphenyl is a simple aromatic compound consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples provided, aromatic compounds with multiple rings, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67, which is a highly conjugated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a property value of 0.61761259. Another example, Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34, which is also a polycyclic aromatic compound, has a property value of 0.09231928.

Given that biphenyl is less complex than these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but still consists of two aromatic rings, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is positive but lower than those of the more complex polycyclic structures. Based on this reasoning, a predicted property value for biphenyl could be around 0.1 to 0.2.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 (biphenyl) is approximately 0.15.

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.4618966205465653
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of molecular structures with different functional groups and chain lengths, and their property values range from negative to positive.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a sulfur atom at the end. This structure is similar to the linear alkanes and alkenes in the examples, such as CCCCCCC(C)C, which has a property value of -4.59646308, and CCCCCCCC=C, with a property value of -2.07017532. These examples suggest that linear hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values, and the presence of a sulfur atom, which is less electronegative than oxygen, might not significantly alter this trend.

Considering the examples and the structure of CCCCCS, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be in the negative range, similar to other linear hydrocarbons. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately -2.5 for CCCCCS.

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.6941725598292164
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol, specifically 2-methyl-2-pentanol. In the examples, we have several aliphatic and branched hydrocarbons, as well as alcohols, which can help us make a prediction.

- The molecule CCC(C)(C)C (2,2-dimethylbutane) has a property value of 0.51814743.
- The molecule CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O (a cyclic alcohol) has a property value of -0.25245423.
- The molecule CCCCCOC (an ether) has a property value of 0.08644175.

Considering the presence of the alcohol group, which generally tends to lower the property value compared to alkanes due to increased polarity and potential hydrogen bonding, and the branching which can increase the property value, we can estimate the property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO.

Taking into account these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO would be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the alcohol group, but not as negative as the cyclic alcohol example due to the lack of a ring structure.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO could be approximately -0.1.

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -1.380318998987799
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is a naphthalene derivative, specifically 1-methylnaphthalene.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a property value of -0.80289916.
- Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (another naphthalene derivative) has a property value of -0.52818397.
- c1ccccc1 (benzene) has a property value of -0.28269963.

The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is structurally similar to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, which is also a naphthalene derivative. Given the property value of -0.52818397 for Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, we can infer that the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 would be in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 would be approximately -0.528.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic urea, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -0.51239808. The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the new molecule.

The addition of an alkyl chain generally increases hydrophobicity, which can affect the property value. However, the examples suggest that the presence of alkyl chains can lead to a more negative property value, as seen in the example of CCCCCC(O)CC with a property value of -1.34935326.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is likely to be slightly more negative than -0.51239808. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately -0.6.

True Property: -0.4322234438872455
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group is known to be electron-withdrawing due to the high electronegativity of fluorine atoms. This can influence the overall electronic properties of the molecule.

Looking at the examples, we see that molecules with electron-withdrawing groups, such as halogens, often have negative property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of -0.15598206, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -4.72883546. These examples suggest that the presence of halogens tends to decrease the property value.

Given that trifluoromethyl is a strong electron-withdrawing group, we can expect the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 to be negative. However, it is likely not as negative as the highly chlorinated compound, but more negative than a simple halogenated benzene.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around -0.5.

From the examples, we can see that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (OH) tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO has a property value of 1.45369923. The structure OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a cyclic form of a similar sugar, which suggests it might have a comparable property value.

Given this analysis, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is likely to be close to 1.45369923. However, due to the cyclic nature, it might be slightly different. A reasonable prediction would be around 1.45.

2. **Multiple Rings and Carbonyls**: The structure has multiple rings and carbonyl groups, similar to the example CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C, which has a property value of 1.21498618.

3. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (C3(O) and C(O)) is a feature that can influence the property value, as seen in the example OCC3OC(OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C(O)C3O, which has a property value of 1.26085708.

Considering these structural similarities and the property values of the examples, the molecule in question is likely to have a positive property value, influenced by the presence of ester and hydroxyl groups, as well as the complex ring structure.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately **1.3**.

The given molecule is a polycyclic compound with multiple cyclohexane rings and a ketone group. It resembles some of the more complex structures in the examples, such as CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 1.19877376. This example also contains multiple cyclohexane rings and an alcohol group, similar to the given molecule.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O contains an acetamide group (CC(=O)N) attached to a nitrobenzene ring (c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O). The presence of the nitro group (N(=O)=O) on the benzene ring is a significant feature, as it is known to influence the electronic properties of the molecule.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with nitro groups on aromatic rings tend to have negative property values. For instance:
- O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.36193658.
- O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12 has a property value of -1.35822508.
- COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.13255844.

The molecule in question is similar to these examples, particularly to O=N(=O)c1ccccc1, but with an additional acetamide group. The acetamide group is less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group, so it might slightly increase the property value compared to a simple nitrobenzene.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is likely to be slightly negative, but not as negative as the more complex nitroaromatic systems. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.3 to -0.4.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.35.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is not directly present in the examples, but similar to some sulfur-containing compounds.
- An ester linkage (OCC), which is present in some examples with moderate to low property values.
- A thioether linkage (SC), which is similar to the CSSC example with a positive property value.
- A chloro-substituted aromatic ring, which is present in several examples with varying property values, often negative.
- A lactone-like structure (n1c(=O)oc2), which is similar to some cyclic structures with moderate to low property values.

Considering these features, the presence of the phosphorothioate and thioether groups might suggest a positive contribution, while the chloro-substituted aromatic ring and the lactone-like structure might suggest a negative contribution. Balancing these factors, the property value is likely to be slightly positive or close to zero.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be approximately 0.1.

The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) tends to contribute to a negative property value, likely due to its polar nature and hydrogen bonding capability.

Given that tert-butanol is a small, branched alcohol, its property value is likely to be similar to other small alcohols. The closest example in terms of structure is CC(C)CO, which has a property value of -0.76242243. Since tert-butanol is slightly more branched, it might have a slightly different value, but it should still be in the same range.

For instance, CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC has a property value of 1.38187251, and CCC(C)C(=O)C has a property value of 0.64015736. The presence of the ester functional group (OC=O) and the isopropyl group (CC(C)) suggests that the property value might be positive, as seen in some of the examples with similar functional groups.

Considering the structure and the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around 0.5. This value reflects the influence of the ester group and the isopropyl group, which are likely to contribute to a positive property value.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings, such as benzene derivatives, tend to have property values around zero or slightly negative.
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro groups) tends to decrease the property value, while electron-donating groups (like alkyl groups) can increase it.
- The urea linkage (O=C-NH-C=O) is polar and can contribute to a more negative property value due to its potential for hydrogen bonding and dipole interactions.

Considering these factors, the molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 has two phenyl rings and a urea linkage, which suggests a property value that is slightly negative, similar to other aromatic compounds with polar functional groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 would be around -0.3.

   - The presence of a phenyl ring (c1ccc(N)cc1) can contribute to the stability and hydrophobic character of the molecule.

3. **Polarity and Hydrogen Bonding**: 
   - The combination of amine groups and the sulfonamide group suggests significant potential for hydrogen bonding, which can affect solubility and other properties.

4. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - Molecules with similar functional groups and aromatic systems in the provided examples tend to have property values that are slightly positive or negative, depending on the balance of hydrophobic and polar interactions.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is likely to be slightly positive, reflecting the balance between the polar sulfonamide and amine groups and the aromatic system. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around **0.2**.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.2071054002026436
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with negative property values.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) attached to the aromatic ring, which can also contribute to a negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
- An alkene group (C=C) in the side chain, which is less common in the examples but can influence the property value.

Based on the examples, molecules with nitro groups and electron-withdrawing groups like trifluoromethyl tend to have negative property values. For instance, molecules like Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O and Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl have negative values.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be negative. A reasonable estimate, based on the examples, would be around -0.5 to -1.0. Therefore, a specific predicted property value could be:

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -1.5511283089409587
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. 

Looking at the examples, we can find similar structures:
- CC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of -1.55290297.
- CCC(C)(C)O has a property value of 0.26094278.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is structurally closer to CC(C)CCOC=O, but with a shorter carbon chain. Esters generally have negative property values in the examples provided, and the presence of the ester functional group tends to lower the property value compared to alcohols or alkanes.

Considering these factors, the property value for CC(C)OC=O is likely to be negative and closer to the value of CC(C)CCOC=O, but slightly less negative due to the shorter chain. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around -1.3.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 0.2536752154310919
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is structurally similar to c1ccccc1O (phenol), which has a property value of -0.19734248. The presence of additional methyl groups in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 could slightly alter the property value, but it is likely to remain in a similar range due to the aromatic nature and the presence of the hydroxyl group.

Considering the examples and the structural similarity, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be slightly higher than that of phenol due to the electron-donating effect of the methyl groups. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.15.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: -0.7626145321340869
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has a thiophosphate group (COP(=S)(OC)O-) attached to a phenyl ring with a methyl (C) and a thiomethyl (SC) substituent. We can compare this structure to the examples:

1. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl both have a property value of -0.04572204. These molecules have a thiophosphate group attached to a phenyl ring with halogen substituents.

2. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl also has a property value of -0.04572204, with a similar structure but different halogen substituents.

The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has a similar thiophosphate group attached to a phenyl ring, but instead of halogens, it has a thiomethyl and a methyl group. The presence of the thiomethyl group (SC) could introduce a different electronic effect compared to halogens, but the overall structure is still quite similar to the examples with a property value of -0.04572204.

Given the structural similarities and the consistent property values for the thiophosphate-phenyl structures in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 will also be close to -0.04572204.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is approximately -0.04572204.

True Property: -2.203803616304856
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples given.

From the examples, we can observe that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have negative property values. For instance:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -2.7777107.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -1.04110935.

The molecule in question, Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is also a highly chlorinated aromatic compound, but it has fewer chlorine atoms than the first example and more than the second. Therefore, we can expect its property value to be between -2.7777107 and -1.04110935.

Given this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be approximately -1.5.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -1.3552600029694306
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to the end. The presence of the nitro group is a significant factor, as it is an electron-withdrawing group that can influence the overall property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O (1.15955234) and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (0.71856039), tend to have positive property values. However, these examples also contain aromatic rings or additional electron-withdrawing groups, which can further influence the property.

In contrast, simpler aliphatic chains without such groups, like CCC (1.28418878) and CCI (1.28418878), have positive property values, but they lack the electron-withdrawing nitro group.

Considering the balance between the aliphatic chain and the electron-withdrawing nitro group, the property value for CCCN(=O)=O is likely to be positive but lower than those of the more complex nitro-containing examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 0.5.

Iteration: 31
SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, similar to some of the examples given.

Let's consider the examples:

1. Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, -0.15598206: This is a chlorobenzene with a bromine substituent.
2. c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12, -1.380319: This is a brominated biphenyl.
3. COc1ccccc1Cl, -0.25607812: This is a chlorobenzene with a methoxy group.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but with a fluorine instead of a chlorine. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which could affect the property value. However, the presence of bromine, which is a common feature, might have a more significant influence.

Considering the examples and the nature of the substituents, the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is likely to be close to that of Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but slightly more negative due to the higher electronegativity of fluorine compared to chlorine.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be approximately -0.20.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.09876388328641421
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles some of the cyclic and bicyclic structures in the examples, such as CC1CCCO1 (0.47583631) and CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2 (1.32635493), but it is simpler and lacks the additional functional groups and aromatic systems that contribute to higher property values.

Given the presence of the tertiary alcohol and the bicyclic structure, the property value is likely to be positive but not as high as those with more complex functionalities. Comparing with similar structures, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 would be around 0.5. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is approximately 0.5.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.3060883807862621
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)
- An amide linkage (N2C(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)

Comparing this structure to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 0.27997543, we notice that both molecules share the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage with a phenyl ring. The main difference is the presence of a thioether linkage (SC(CCl)) in the example, which is absent in the molecule we are predicting.

Given the structural similarities and the absence of the thioether linkage, which might slightly affect the property value, we can predict that the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O will be close to, but slightly lower than, 0.27997543.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is approximately 0.25.

To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of -0.21661654. Both molecules contain a benzene ring and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle with a carbonyl group.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of the carbonyl and nitrogen atoms, the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is likely to be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately -0.25.

True Property: -0.08462064654108258
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which consists of a heptanoic acid moiety (CCCCCCC(=O)O) and an ethyl group (CC).

Looking at the examples, we have:

1. CCCCC, with a property value of 0.46189662.
2. CCCCCCC(=O)OC, with a property value of -0.50146597.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar to CCCCCCC(=O)OC, but with an additional ethyl group. The presence of the ester functional group and the length of the carbon chain are important factors. The addition of the ethyl group might slightly increase the property value compared to CCCCCCC(=O)OC due to increased hydrophobicity and molecular size.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be slightly higher than -0.50146597. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.45.

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -1.1499439418143176
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is methyl benzoate, an ester with a benzene ring. In the examples, we have several molecules with aromatic rings and ester groups:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1, with a property value of -2.77984676.
2. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, with a property value of -2.86171418.

Both examples are esters with aromatic rings, and they have negative property values. The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is similar to the second example, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, but without the ethyl group. The presence of the methoxy group instead of the ethoxy group might slightly affect the property value, but it is likely to remain in the same range.

Given the similarity, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is likely to be close to -2.86171418. However, since the methoxy group is slightly less bulky than the ethoxy group, the property value might be slightly less negative. Therefore, a reasonable prediction would be around -2.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear conjugated diene, which is similar to some of the simpler hydrocarbons in the examples.

Looking at the examples, simpler hydrocarbons like CCC(C)(C)CC (0.67114639) and C1CCCC1 (0.67260903) have positive property values, while unsaturated hydrocarbons like CC/C=C/C (-1.45512222) and C=Cc1ccccc1 (-0.32026949) have negative property values. The presence of conjugated double bonds in C=CCC=C suggests it might have a property value closer to the unsaturated hydrocarbons with negative values.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C would be around -1.0.

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.13133295173831924
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular size and complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br, also known as bromoform, is a simple halogenated compound with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples, halogenated aromatic compounds like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 and Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1 have property values of -1.380319, indicating that the presence of halogens tends to result in negative property values. Additionally, the molecule FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br, which is a halogenated compound with multiple halogens, has a positive property value of 0.95707986, but it is more complex than BrC(Br)Br.

Considering the simplicity and high halogen content of BrC(Br)Br, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value, similar to other halogenated compounds. However, due to its simplicity compared to the aromatic halogenated examples, the value might be less negative.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around -1.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -1.24678911.
- An amide linkage within a cyclic structure, similar to the example CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O, which has a property value of 0.58685392.
- A chlorinated carbon, similar to the example CCC(C)Cl, which has a property value of -0.76242243.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the chlorinated carbon suggests a tendency towards a more negative property value. However, the cyclic amide structure might moderate this effect.

Balancing these influences, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around -0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A dimethylamino group (CN(C)C(=O)), which is present in the example CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C with a property value of 1.10162311.
- A chloro-substituted aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O with a property value of -0.26874588.
- A heterocyclic ring with a nitro group, similar to the nitro-substituted aromatic rings in the examples with negative property values.
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C), which is a bulky group that can influence the property value.

Considering these features, the molecule has a combination of electron-withdrawing groups (chloro and nitro) and electron-donating groups (dimethylamino), along with a bulky tert-butyl group. The presence of the dimethylamino group suggests a positive contribution, while the chloro and nitro groups suggest a negative contribution.

Balancing these effects, the predicted property value is likely to be slightly positive, but not as high as the example with only the dimethylamino group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately:

0.5

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with chlorine atoms attached to each ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, which has a property value of 0.83042438. However, the example molecule has more chlorine atoms, which generally increase the property value due to their electronegative nature and potential for increasing molecular interactions.

Given that the target molecule has fewer chlorine atoms and a different structural arrangement (with an ether linkage), we can expect its property value to be somewhat lower than 0.83042438. Additionally, the presence of the ether linkage might slightly reduce the property value compared to a fully chlorinated phenyl ring.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be around 0.6.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC/C=C\C, we can look at the example provided for a similar molecule, CC/C=C/C, which has a property value of -1.45512222. The only difference between the two molecules is the stereochemistry around the double bond, which is unlikely to significantly affect the property value in this context. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C would be approximately the same as for CC/C=C/C, which is -1.45512222.

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 0.08644175276071196
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their corresponding property values.

The molecule CCCOCC is a linear chain with an ether functional group. Let's consider similar structures from the examples:

1. CC(C)O (0.13133295) - This is a small alcohol with a similar chain length and an oxygen atom.
2. CCC(O)CC (-2.7638461) - This is a longer chain alcohol, but with a significantly different property value.
3. C1CCCCCC1 (0.74503357) - This is a cyclohexane, which is a saturated hydrocarbon with a positive property value.

The presence of the ether group in CCCOCC might suggest a property value closer to neutral or slightly positive, as ethers are generally less polar than alcohols and do not have hydrogen bonding like alcohols do.

Considering the examples and the structure of CCCOCC, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be slightly positive, similar to CC(C)O, but potentially lower due to the lack of hydrogen bonding.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCOCC could be approximately 0.1.

The molecule in question is a tertiary amide with two phenyl rings and a tert-butyl group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 1.26290808. Both molecules contain a tertiary amide and two phenyl rings, although the example has an additional heterocyclic component.

Another similar example is CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23, which has a property value of 1.25907523. This molecule also contains a tertiary amide and a complex ring system, although it lacks the phenyl rings present in the molecule we are predicting.

Considering these similarities, the predicted property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be in a similar range to these examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 1.26.

- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-), which is a common feature in several molecules in the list.
- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1), which is also present in some examples.

From the examples:
- Molecules with bromobenzene, such as Fc1cccc(Br)c1 and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1, have property values of 0.0 and -0.15598206, respectively.
- Molecules with acetamide or similar amide groups, such as CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, have property values around -0.31420556.

Considering these observations, the presence of both an amide group and a bromobenzene moiety suggests a property value that might be slightly negative, as both components tend to contribute to negative values in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around -0.2.

From the examples, we can observe the following:

1. Molecules with alkyl groups attached to benzene rings, such as Cc1ccccc1N (0.17110868) and CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.92013964), tend to have property values around -0.9 to 0.2.

2. The presence of additional functional groups or structural complexity can significantly affect the property value, as seen in examples like CC1CCCCC1NC(=O)Nc2ccccc2 (1.03677993) and CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO (1.15711358).

3. The molecule CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.83547318) is structurally similar to the target molecule, with a similar alkyl group attached to a benzene ring, suggesting a similar property value.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is likely to be close to that of similar alkylbenzene structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is approximately -0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have positive property values, while those with electron-donating groups, such as methoxy groups, tend to have negative property values. The presence of halogens also seems to influence the property value positively.

Benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, similar to the nitro group but generally less strong. Comparing it to similar structures, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (0.22028002) and O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O (0.48980746), we can infer that benzaldehyde's property value might be positive but not as high as those with stronger electron-withdrawing groups.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) would be around 0.2.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.6957808164810642
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group and an oxazole ring. The presence of a nitro group (N(=O)=O) often contributes to a negative property value, as seen in several examples. Additionally, the presence of heteroatoms like oxygen and nitrogen in the ring can also influence the property value.

Comparing with similar structures:
- Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 has a property value of -0.66680818, which is a heterocyclic compound with an oxygen atom in the ring.
- Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -1.39530429, which is a highly chlorinated compound with a negative property value.
- NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1 has a property value of -2.29397142, which is a compound with a strong electron-withdrawing group (thiourea).

Considering these comparisons, the presence of the nitro group and the heterocyclic structure, the predicted property value for O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is likely to be negative. Given the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.8 to -1.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is approximately -0.9.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.8787378958129322
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group (N-N linkage).

Looking at the examples, we have a similar structure: N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 0.52741199. The main difference between the two structures is the presence of a double bond between the nitrogen atoms in the example, whereas the molecule in question has a single bond.

The presence of a double bond in the example might contribute to a slightly higher property value due to increased conjugation or planarity. Therefore, the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 might have a slightly lower property value compared to the example with the double bond.

Taking this into consideration, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be slightly less than 0.52741199. A predicted value could be around 0.4 to 0.5. Let's choose a specific value:

True Property: 0.17594047968239448
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a relatively small and rigid structure with two carbonyl groups and a cyclohexane ring. In the examples, similar cyclic structures with amide or carbonyl groups tend to have property values around 0.07 to 0.75. For instance, the molecule C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1 has a property value of 0.07255657, and O=C1N(COC(=O)CC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 has a property value of 0.75753296.

Considering the structural similarity to these examples, particularly the presence of the diketopiperazine core, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 would be around 0.1 to 0.2.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately 0.15.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: -1.0827895003414343
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples.

The given molecule is 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, which is a chlorinated aromatic compound. In the examples, we have:

1. Clc1ccccc1Cl (1,2-dichlorobenzene) with a property value of 0.17110868.
2. Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl with a property value of -0.41160616.

The target molecule is similar to 1,2-dichlorobenzene but with an additional chlorine atom, which might slightly decrease the property value due to increased electron-withdrawing effects and steric hindrance. However, it is less complex than the second example, which has a more negative property value.

Considering these factors, the property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is likely to be slightly lower than that of 1,2-dichlorobenzene but not as low as the more complex chlorinated compound. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.1.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -1.784129499997725
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is an alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically a diethylbenzene.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Simple aromatic compounds like benzene derivatives tend to have property values around the range of -0.3 to 0.5.
2. The presence of alkyl groups (like ethyl groups) generally increases the property value slightly due to increased hydrophobicity.

For instance, the molecule Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) has a property value of 0.17110868, and Cc1ccccc1 (toluene) would likely have a similar or slightly lower value due to the absence of the amino group.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a diethylbenzene, it is more hydrophobic than toluene or aniline, but it lacks polar functional groups that would significantly alter the property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be slightly higher than that of toluene or aniline, but not as high as more complex or polar-substituted aromatics.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be approximately 0.25.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a para-substituted aniline with a sulfonamide group. 

Looking at the examples, we can find some similar structures:
- Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.26874588. This molecule is a para-nitroaniline, which is somewhat similar in terms of having an electron-withdrawing group (nitro) on the benzene ring.
- Oc1cccc2cccnc12 has a property value of -0.71260116. This molecule is a bicyclic aromatic compound with a nitrogen atom, which is less similar but still provides some context for aromatic systems with heteroatoms.

The sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is a strong electron-withdrawing group, similar to the nitro group in terms of its effect on the aromatic ring. Given the similarity to the para-nitroaniline example, we can expect the property value to be in a similar range, but possibly slightly more negative due to the additional electron-withdrawing effect of the sulfonamide group compared to the nitro group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be slightly more negative than -0.26874588, perhaps around -0.3 to -0.4. Let's choose a specific value:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically triphenylene. In the examples, similar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons include:

- c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12, with a property value of 0.03862928
- c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54, with a property value of 0.60377126

Both of these examples have positive property values, indicating that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons tend to have positive property values in this dataset. The structure of triphenylene is similar to these examples, but it is more symmetric and lacks additional substituents like methyl groups.

Considering the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, I would predict that the property value for triphenylene (c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34) is likely to be positive and closer to the lower end of the range observed for similar structures.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of triphenylene is approximately 0.5.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule contains multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings, similar to some of the examples with negative property values. Additionally, the presence of carbonyl groups and the overall structure suggests a complex, possibly electron-withdrawing nature.

Based on the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic systems, such as Oc1cccc(O)c1, have a property value of 0.0. However, the additional carbonyl group and the overall structure in the given molecule might lead to a more negative value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 would be approximately -0.5.

True Property: 1.5317366128716827
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl with a property value of -0.04572204.
- An amide linkage (NC(C)=O), which is present in several molecules with varying property values, such as CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCCCC2 with -0.14328355 and CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 with -3.70723631.
- A thioester linkage (SC), which is not directly present in the examples but can be considered similar to sulfur-containing groups.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a property value close to neutral or slightly negative. The amide linkage can contribute to a more negative value, but the overall structure does not suggest extreme values.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around -0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, symmetrical molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with halogen atoms, particularly chlorine, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -2.7777107, and Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of 0.2691053. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally contributes to a more negative property value.

Given that Cl\C=C/Cl is a simple molecule with two chlorine atoms, we can expect its property value to be negative, but not as negative as more complex or heavily chlorinated structures. Based on the trend observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around -0.5.

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.2826996349086759
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the examples provided and look for patterns or similarities. Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle with a nitrogen atom in the ring, similar to some of the other nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds in the list.

Let's consider the examples with nitrogen-containing aromatic rings:

1. CNc1ccccc1, -1.34657371
2. c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23, -1.32404766
3. Cc1ncnc2nccnc12, -0.71260116

These examples show that nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds tend to have negative property values. Pyridine, being a simple aromatic heterocycle with one nitrogen, is most similar to the first example (CNc1ccccc1) in terms of structure, as it is a single aromatic ring with a nitrogen atom.

Given this analysis, we can predict that the property value for pyridine (c1ccncc1) will also be negative and likely in the range of the examples provided. A reasonable estimate for the property value of pyridine would be around -1.3, similar to the first example.

Therefore, the predicted property value for c1ccncc1 is approximately -1.3.

True Property: 0.9846696724795247
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has several key features:
1. An ester linkage (COC(=O)).
2. A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1).
3. An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23).
4. A pyridine-like structure (ccnc).
5. A chlorine substituent on an aromatic ring.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with ester linkages, such as CCCCOC(=O)CC, tend to have negative property values.
- Aromatic rings with chlorine substituents, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1, have slightly negative to positive values.
- Amide linkages, as seen in CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2, can have positive values.
- Pyridine-like structures, such as c1ccc2cnccc2c1, tend to have negative values.

Considering these observations, the molecule has a mix of features that contribute both positively and negatively to the property value. The presence of the ester and pyridine-like structure suggests a negative contribution, while the amide linkage and aromatic chlorine might contribute positively.

Balancing these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 is likely to be slightly negative, around -0.2.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 0.08644175276071196
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the trends and characteristics of the given examples. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol with five carbon atoms and one hydroxyl group, making it a primary alcohol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Linear alkanes and alcohols tend to have property values around 0. For instance, OC1CCCCCCC1 (a cyclic alcohol) has a property value of 0.59570477, and CCCCCC (a linear alkane) would likely have a similar property value close to zero.

2. The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) in alcohols generally increases the property value compared to alkanes of similar size, as seen in the example of OC1CCCCCCC1.

3. The property values for small linear molecules like COC=O (0.2063698) and CCOC=O (-0.11812665) are close to zero, indicating that small changes in structure can slightly affect the property value.

Considering these points, CCCCCO, being a linear alcohol with a moderate chain length, is expected to have a property value slightly above zero, reflecting the influence of the hydroxyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be approximately 0.5.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule contains a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), an amide linkage (C(=O)N), and an aromatic ring, which are features that can influence the property value.

Based on the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and sulfonyl groups tend to have negative property values, often due to their electron-withdrawing nature. The presence of an amide linkage can also contribute to a negative value, as seen in some of the examples.

Considering these factors and the trends observed in the examples, I would predict that the property value for CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is likely to be negative. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around -0.5, given the influence of the sulfonyl and amide groups.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:

1. **Aromatic Ring**: The presence of a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) is a common feature in many of the examples, often associated with a range of property values.

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The nitro group is known to influence the property significantly, often contributing to a more negative value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

3. **Ester Groups (C(=O)OC)**: The presence of ester groups can also affect the property, typically contributing to a more positive value due to their electron-donating resonance effect.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring with Nitrogen**: The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle (C1=C(C)NC) can also influence the property, often contributing to a more negative value.

5. **Methyl Groups (C)**: Methyl groups are generally electron-donating and can contribute to a more positive property value.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule has both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups. The nitro group and the nitrogen in the heterocycle are likely to have a stronger influence, potentially leading to a more negative property value. However, the presence of ester groups and methyl groups may offset this to some extent.

Based on the balance of these structural features and their influence as seen in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.5. This reflects the net effect of the electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups present in the structure.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two carbonyl groups and a cycloalkane structure. In the examples, molecules with cyclic structures and carbonyl groups tend to have property values that are slightly positive or close to zero, depending on the presence of additional functional groups or aromatic systems.

For instance, the molecule ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of 0.06164326, and it contains carbonyl groups and a cyclic structure. Similarly, the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of -1.7653448, but it also contains a more complex aromatic system and additional functional groups.

Given the simplicity of the diketopiperazine structure compared to the more complex examples, and considering the presence of carbonyl groups and a cyclic structure, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be slightly positive or close to zero.

Therefore, a predicted property value for this molecule could be approximately 0.05.

To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups and the overall complexity of the molecule.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure, consisting of a chloroethane (ethyl chloride) group. In the examples, simple aliphatic hydrocarbons like CCCCC have a property value of 0.46189662, while aromatic compounds with halogens, such as Clc1ccccc1, have a negative property value of -0.19734248. The presence of chlorine in ClCC might suggest a property value closer to the negative range, similar to other halogenated compounds.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the chlorine atom. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately -0.2 for ClCC.

The molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a pyridine ring (a benzene ring with one nitrogen atom) and a trichloromethyl group attached. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of -0.77488428. Both molecules have chlorinated aromatic rings, but the presence of the nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring could influence the property value.

Considering the examples, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally leads to a negative property value, and the nitrogen in the pyridine ring might slightly alter this effect. However, the overall trend suggests a negative value due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the chlorine atoms.

Based on these observations, I would predict the property value for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl to be approximately -0.8.

The molecule CCCCC(C)O is a primary alcohol with a linear alkyl chain, similar to the example molecule CCCCCCC(O)CCC, which has a property value of -0.67449076. The main difference is the length of the carbon chain and the position of the hydroxyl group.

Given that CCCCC(C)O has a slightly shorter carbon chain and a similar functional group, we can expect its property value to be in a similar range, but slightly less negative due to the shorter chain.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCC(C)O would be approximately -0.65.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values. For instance, ClCCl has a property value of 1.28418878, and CI has a property value of 1.80940776.
- The presence of multiple halogen atoms, especially bromine or iodine, tends to increase the property value.

Considering these trends, 1,4-dibromobenzene is likely to have a positive property value, similar to other halogenated aromatic compounds. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around 1.5.

Given the trend that increased chlorination tends to decrease the property value (as seen in the example), and considering the structural similarity, we can predict that the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl will be slightly higher than -0.17665019, but still negative due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately -0.15.

- Compounds with ester or phosphate groups can have positive property values, especially if they are not heavily substituted with electron-withdrawing groups.

Given the structure of the molecule, it is similar to other aromatic compounds with ester linkages, which tend to have property values around or slightly above zero. The presence of the phosphate group, which is not heavily electron-withdrawing, suggests a positive contribution.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be slightly positive, around 0.2 to 0.5. Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a specific predicted property value could be approximately:

- A piperidine-like ring with two chlorine atoms and a ketone group, which can also influence the property value.

Looking at the examples:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro groups) tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of halogens (Cl, F) often contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in several examples.
- The presence of a ketone group in a cyclic structure can also contribute to a negative property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O would be around -0.5 to -1.0. Given the specific structural features and their influence, a predicted property value could be approximately:

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.13255843590078367
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring, and a nitro group (NO2) also attached to the benzene ring. 

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, tend to have negative property values. The example given has a property value of -0.25758836.
- Molecules with methoxy groups, such as COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC, have a positive property value of 0.22266944.
- The presence of a benzene ring can contribute to either positive or negative values depending on the substituents.

Considering these observations, the presence of both a methoxy group and a nitro group on the benzene ring suggests a balance between the positive influence of the methoxy group and the negative influence of the nitro group. However, the nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which might have a more significant impact.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is likely to be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the nitro group. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around -0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of -2.5641865. Both molecules are heavily chlorinated, which generally increases the electron-withdrawing nature and potentially decreases the property value.

Given the structural similarity and the high degree of chlorination, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl will be in a similar range, likely slightly more negative due to the additional complexity and potential for increased electron-withdrawing effects.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl would be approximately -2.7.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.47958174808637466
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with ester groups (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1) tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of alkyl chains (e.g., CCCCCC#C) also tends to result in negative property values.

Given these observations, CCCOC=O, which is a relatively simple ester with a short alkyl chain, is likely to have a negative property value. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be around -0.5. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC=O is approximately -0.5.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.223072323429842
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a simple ester, specifically decyl acetate, which consists of a long alkyl chain (10 carbon atoms) and an ester functional group.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with long alkyl chains, such as CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 (0.53055541) and CCCCCC=C(CC)C=O (1.0472154), tend to have positive property values.
2. Esters, such as CCCOC (0.46189662), also have positive property values.

Given the structure of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, which combines a long alkyl chain with an ester group, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. Considering the examples and the nature of the molecule, a value around 0.5 to 1.0 seems plausible.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 0.6.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

This molecule contains:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to the aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.02531591.
- Molecules with phenol groups, such as Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1, have a property value of -1.380319.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, have a property value of -0.36193658.

Considering these observations, the presence of both electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and chloro) and the phenol group suggests a property value that is likely negative, but not as low as the most negative examples due to the balancing effect of the amide linkage.

Taking into account the structural features and their influence on the property, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be around -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- Two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are similar to the phosphorothioate group in the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of -1.24678911.
- Aromatic rings with ether linkages, similar to the example CC(=O)CC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2c(O)c3ccccc3oc2=O with a property value of 0.34493431.
- Sulfur linkages, which are present in the example CCSSCC with a property value of 0.08644175.

The presence of multiple phosphorothioate groups, aromatic rings, and sulfur linkages suggests that the property value might be influenced by these features. The examples with phosphorothioate groups tend to have negative property values, while aromatic systems with additional functional groups can vary.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 is likely to be negative, influenced by the phosphorothioate groups. A reasonable estimate, considering the examples, would be around -1.5.

True Property: -0.02531590614112567
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

In the examples, we have the molecule Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which is nitrotoluene, with a property value of 0.22028002. The presence of the nitro group in both molecules suggests that they might have similar electronic effects. However, the hydroxyl group in 4-nitrophenol can introduce additional hydrogen bonding and polarity, which might affect the property value.

Another example is Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, which is a chlorinated phenol, with a property value of 0.52173888. The presence of the hydroxyl group in both molecules suggests some similarity, but the chlorines in the example molecule might contribute differently compared to the nitro group.

Considering these comparisons, the property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is likely to be influenced by both the electron-withdrawing nitro group and the polar hydroxyl group. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of 4-nitrophenol would be around 0.22028002, similar to nitrotoluene, but slightly adjusted for the additional effects of the hydroxyl group.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is approximately 0.22028002.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. This molecule is a complex sugar, likely a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide, given its multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic acetal structures.

From the examples, it seems that molecules with more polar functional groups, such as hydroxyls, tend to have more negative property values. The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups in the given molecule suggests it is highly polar and hydrophilic, similar to other sugar-like structures.

Considering the examples and the nature of the molecule, I would predict a property value that is negative, reflecting its high polarity and similarity to other sugar-like structures. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around -0.5, given the trends observed in the examples.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -0.2362332024669209
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCC#C is a simple alkyne, specifically 1-butyne, with a terminal triple bond.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with simple linear or branched alkanes and alkenes, such as CCCCCCCCCC=O (-0.88997254) and CCCCCCCCCCCCCC=O (-1.38720924), tend to have negative property values.
2. Molecules with functional groups like carbonyls, nitro groups, or halogens can have varying effects on the property value, often making it more negative or positive depending on the specific structure and functional group interactions.
3. The presence of a triple bond, as in N#Cc1ccccc1C#N (0.52687428), can influence the property value, but this example also includes aromatic rings and cyano groups, which complicate direct comparison.

Given that CCC#C is a small, linear alkyne without additional functional groups or aromatic rings, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly negative, similar to simple alkanes or alkenes, but potentially less negative due to the presence of the triple bond, which might slightly increase the property value compared to a saturated alkane.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around -0.5.

True Property: -0.20939137875060088
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -1.24678911.
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of -4.72883546, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of -2.7777107.

Considering these structural similarities, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring tends to lower the property value, as seen in the examples. The phosphorothioate group also contributes to a lower property value, as seen in the example with a similar group.

Taking these factors into account, the predicted property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be negative and closer to the lower end of the examples with similar features. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately -2.5.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is a pyridine derivative with a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a hydrazine moiety (NN). This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2, which has a pyrimidine ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing functional group. The property value for this example is -0.18650373.

Considering the structural similarities, particularly the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle and a carbonyl group, the property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is likely to be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be approximately -0.18.

True Property: -0.542182633230957
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule contains several functional groups and structural motifs:

1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)**: This is a key feature that can influence the property significantly. In the examples, the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1 has a property value of -0.32624622. The presence of the phosphorothioate group in both molecules suggests a potential similarity in property values.

2. **Amide group (C(=O)N)**: The presence of an amide group can also affect the property. In the examples, the molecule COC(=O)N has a property value of -1.35526, indicating that amides can contribute to a more negative property value.

3. **Alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)**: These are common in many of the examples and generally contribute to less extreme property values, often closer to zero.

4. **Piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)**: This is a saturated nitrogen-containing ring, which can influence the property. In the examples, the presence of nitrogen in rings or chains often results in a positive contribution to the property value.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative due to the presence of the phosphorothioate and amide groups, but not as negative as the more extreme examples. The alkyl chains and piperidine ring may moderate this effect.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around -0.3.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (octane), we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, aromatic rings, and the overall size and shape of the molecule.

In the given examples, linear alkanes and simple alcohols tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCC(O)CC has a property value of -2.7638461, and CCCCCCCCO has a property value of -0.70445226. These examples suggest that linear alkanes and alcohols generally have negative property values, with longer chains potentially having more negative values.

Given that CCCCCCCC is a linear alkane (octane) with no functional groups or aromatic rings, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be negative, similar to other linear alkanes in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (octane) is approximately -2.5.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as functional groups, molecular size, and overall molecular geometry. The examples provided suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, ring structures, and possibly the degree of unsaturation or aromaticity.

The molecule in question, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, contains several notable features:
- Multiple cyclohexane rings, which are saturated and typically contribute positively to the property value.
- A ketone group (C=O), which can have a varying effect depending on its position and the surrounding structure.
- An alcohol group (O), which can also influence the property value.
- An alkyne group (C#C), which introduces unsaturation and can affect the property value.

Considering these features and comparing them to the examples provided, particularly those with similar ring structures and functional groups, the property value is likely to be positive. The presence of the alkyne group might slightly reduce the value compared to fully saturated systems, but the overall structure suggests a positive property value.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C would be approximately 0.9.

The molecule you've provided, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, is quite complex and contains multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and oxygen-containing functional groups. These features are similar to some of the molecules in the examples, particularly those with higher property values.

Given the presence of multiple ether and hydroxyl groups, as well as the complex polycyclic structure, it is reasonable to predict a relatively high property value. Based on the examples, molecules with similar complexity and functional groups tend to have positive property values.

Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately 1.2 for this molecule.

- Molecules with ester and amide linkages can have varying property values, but the presence of halogens and aromatic rings seems to dominate the trend towards negative values.

Considering these observations, the presence of both chloroalkyne and chlorinated aromatic ring in the molecule suggests a negative property value. The structural complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups might moderate the negativity compared to simpler chlorinated aromatics.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around -1.2.

- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2) attached to the central carbon.
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe:

- The presence of heterocycles like pyrimidine can also contribute to a negative property value (e.g., Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2).

Considering these observations, the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl is likely to have a negative property value due to its structural complexity, the presence of multiple aromatic rings, halogen substituents, and a heterocyclic ring.

Based on the trends from the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -1.0.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- Oc1cccc(O)c1 with a property value of 0.0, which is phenol.
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O with a property value of 0.04758191, which is a methylated phenol with an additional alkyl group.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is structurally similar to phenol (Oc1cccc(O)c1) but with an additional methyl group, which is similar to the structure of CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O. The presence of the methyl group in the para position relative to the hydroxyl group can slightly increase the property value compared to phenol.

Given these considerations, the predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is likely to be slightly above 0.0, similar to the value for CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O is approximately 0.05.

Let's consider the examples with similar structures:
- Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -1.81320799.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -1.47685337.

Both of these examples are polychlorinated aromatic compounds, and they have negative property values. The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is also a polychlorinated aromatic compound, but with fewer chlorine atoms than the first example and a similar number to the second example.

Given the trend that more chlorine atoms tend to result in more negative property values, and considering the structural similarity to the second example, we can predict that the property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl will be slightly less negative than -1.47685337.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple alkene with a branched structure. It contains a double bond and a methyl group attached to the main carbon chain. In the examples, alkenes and branched alkanes tend to have negative property values, often due to their non-polar nature and lack of functional groups that might contribute to a positive property value.

For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCC=C (an alkene) has a property value of -3.38813188, and the molecule CCCCCCCC (an alkane) has a property value of -0.70445226. The presence of a double bond in isoprene might contribute to a slightly more negative value compared to a simple alkane, but less negative than a longer chain alkene.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around -1.0. This accounts for the presence of the double bond and the relatively small size of the molecule compared to the longer chain alkenes in the examples.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1.2841887797598681
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane), we can analyze the given examples and their properties. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

Dichloromethane is a simple molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a single carbon atom. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl and ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl), have positive property values. This suggests that the presence of chlorine atoms might contribute positively to the property value.

Considering the simplicity of ClCCl compared to the more complex chlorinated compounds in the examples, we can predict a property value that is positive but likely lower than those of the more complex chlorinated compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl is approximately 0.5.

Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether linkages, methoxy groups, and hydroxyl groups. It also contains fused aromatic rings and a lactone moiety. These features suggest a relatively high degree of complexity and potential for interactions, which could influence its property value.

Given the examples, molecules with complex polycyclic structures and multiple functional groups tend to have higher property values. For instance, molecules like CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO and CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O have property values of 1.17136785 and 1.19877376, respectively.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups in the given molecule, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be in the higher range, similar to the complex polycyclic examples provided.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 is approximately 1.15.

True Property: 0.7351791246554606
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) atoms, along with the carbonyl group (C=O), suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and polar interactions, which can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar functional groups and heteroatoms tend to have property values that are either slightly positive or negative, depending on the specific arrangement and additional groups present. For instance, the molecule CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a property value of 0.21475333, which is somewhat similar in terms of having a nitrogen-rich heterocyclic system and a tert-butyl group.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is likely to be close to that of similar structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately:

True Property: -2.8617141812500333
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate, which is an ester formed from benzoic acid and ethanol. It contains an aromatic benzene ring and an ester functional group. 

Looking at the examples, we can find some similar structures:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 has a property value of -0.17168059. This molecule is more complex due to the presence of additional functional groups like sulfonamide and a heterocyclic ring.
- CCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of -0.39967562. This is a simple ester with a longer aliphatic chain.
- CCCCC(=O)OCC has a property value of -0.05397731. This is a similar ester with a pentyl group instead of a phenyl group.

Given that CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an aromatic ester, it is likely to have a property value closer to the simpler esters, but slightly more negative due to the aromatic ring's influence compared to aliphatic chains.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around -0.1.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.7044522598436421
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the length of carbon chains, and the presence of halogens.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached. In the examples, linear alkyl chains tend to have negative property values, and the presence of halogens like bromine or chlorine can further influence the value. For instance, the molecule Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of -1.380319, indicating that the presence of bromine can contribute to a more negative value.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be negative, similar to other linear alkyl chains with halogens. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be approximately -1.2.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.8094077559191744
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide), we can analyze the given examples and their associated property values. The examples include a variety of organic and inorganic compounds with different functional groups and structural features. The property values range from highly negative to positive, indicating a diverse set of properties.

Carbon monoxide is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is a small, non-polar molecule with a relatively high bond order. In the context of the given examples, smaller and simpler molecules tend to have property values closer to zero, but the specific value can vary based on the nature of the molecule.

Given the examples, the property values for small, simple molecules like CCC (propane) and CCBr (bromoethane) are positive, while others like NC(=O)N (urea) are negative. Considering the nature of CO as a small, non-polar molecule, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is close to zero but slightly positive due to its stability and non-polarity.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO is approximately:

0.1
