SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.6471701845248036
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the patterns and trends from the given examples. The molecule in question is a linear aliphatic ester, similar to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Linear aliphatic chains tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of an ester group (as in CCCCCCCC(=O)OC) also tends to result in negative property values, as seen in examples like CCCCCCCC(C)O (-0.90768526) and CCCCCCC(=O)OC (-0.29512381).

Given these observations, the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is expected to have a negative property value. Considering the length of the carbon chain and the presence of the ester group, a reasonable prediction would be slightly more negative than the example CCCCCCC(=O)OC, due to the longer chain.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC could be approximately -0.350.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.4835978587570031
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a fused heterocyclic structure, specifically a chlorinated benzoxazole. The presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the electron-withdrawing character, which can affect the overall electronic properties of the molecule. The examples provided show that chlorinated aromatic compounds can have a range of property values, but they tend to be positive when the structure is highly aromatic and electron-withdrawing groups are present.

Considering the examples:
- Chlorinated aromatic compounds like Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl have a high positive value (0.90565246).
- Other chlorinated aromatic compounds like Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 have a positive value (0.72793934).

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 has a similar aromatic and electron-withdrawing character due to the chlorine and the oxazole ring. Based on these observations, I would predict a positive property value, likely in the range of the other chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is approximately 0.75.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.6880837141372319
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O). The presence of the nitro group is significant because it is an electron-withdrawing group, which can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have property values around -0.09584217. The presence of the nitro group tends to lower the property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

Considering the structural similarity and the influence of the nitro group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O would be around -0.1. Therefore, the predicted specific property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.1.

True Property: -0.8964639172335784
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as functional groups, molecular size, and overall molecular geometry. The molecule in question, CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple rings and carbonyl groups.

From the examples provided, it seems that molecules with complex polycyclic structures and carbonyl groups tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C has a property value of -0.63782171, which is a similar type of structure with multiple rings and carbonyl groups.

Considering these factors, I would predict that the property value for the given molecule, CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, is likely to be negative and in a similar range to the example provided. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately -0.65.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A fluorinated benzene ring (Fc1cccc(F)c1), which is similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 with a property value of -0.32343776.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N), which is a common feature in several molecules with varying property values.
- A chlorinated benzene ring (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 0.92990956.

The presence of both electron-withdrawing groups (fluorine and chlorine) and the amide linkage suggests a balance between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects. The examples show that chlorinated and fluorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values, while amide linkages can vary.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 is likely to be slightly positive, reflecting the influence of the electron-withdrawing groups and the amide linkage.

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.3453773468457735
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with a linear chain and a branching methyl group. It is similar in structure to other small aliphatic ethers and alcohols in the examples, such as CCCCCO (-0.7341576) and CCCCCCCBr (-0.46738248). These molecules tend to have negative property values, likely due to their non-polar nature and lack of significant functional groups that would contribute to a positive property value.

Given the structural similarity to these examples, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is likely to be negative. Considering the trend and the specific structure, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C would be around -0.6.

True Property: -0.691859240860948
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with two carbonyl groups and a bromine atom. From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with halogens (like Cl or Br) often have negative property values, especially when multiple halogens are present or when they are part of an aromatic system.
2. The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) also tends to contribute to negative property values, as seen in several examples.
3. The presence of alkyl groups (like CCC(C)) can sometimes increase the property value, but this effect is often outweighed by the presence of more electronegative atoms or groups.

Given these observations, the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O has a combination of features that suggest a negative property value. The presence of the bromine atom and two carbonyl groups in an aromatic system is likely to dominate the effect of the alkyl group.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.7, reflecting the influence of the halogen and carbonyl groups.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. 

Biphenyl is an aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of two connected phenyl rings. In the examples, aromatic compounds with similar structures, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 has a property value of 0.51242113, and Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34 has a property value of 0.77145762. These examples suggest that aromatic systems with multiple benzene rings tend to have positive property values.

Given that biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic compound with two benzene rings, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value, likely in the range of the simpler aromatic compounds provided in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 (biphenyl) would be approximately 0.5.

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.9169082811914404
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the examples provided and look for patterns or similarities. The molecule CCCCCS is a linear alkane with a sulfur atom at the end, which is similar to other linear alkanes in the examples, such as CCCCCCC(C)O (-0.90768526) and CCCCCCCC=C (-0.87348842). These examples have negative property values, indicating that linear alkanes tend to have negative property values.

Considering the presence of sulfur, which is less electronegative than oxygen, the property value might be slightly less negative compared to an alcohol but still negative due to the linear alkane structure. Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be around -0.85.

Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.9030330349758371
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with a tertiary carbon attached to an alcohol group. In the examples, we have:

- CCC(C)(C)C, which has a property value of -0.79058018.
- CC(C)CC(C)O, which has a property value of -0.42540014.

The presence of the alcohol group in CC(C)CC(C)O seems to increase the property value compared to the fully hydrocarbon branched structure CCC(C)(C)C. The alcohol group introduces polarity, which generally affects the property value.

Given that CCCC(C)(C)CO is similar to CC(C)CC(C)O but with a longer carbon chain, we can expect the property value to be slightly different but in the same range. The longer carbon chain might slightly decrease the property value due to increased hydrophobic character, but the presence of the alcohol group will still have a significant impact.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO would be around -0.5.

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.058250704158588636
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is a naphthalene derivative, specifically 1-methyl-naphthalene.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds, particularly those with naphthalene structures, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, which is a similar naphthalene derivative, has a property value of 0.87899962. Another example, Cc1ccccc1, which is toluene, has a property value of 0.90681437.

Given the structural similarity of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 to these examples, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be positive and likely in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately 0.88.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a cyclic compound with a urea-like structure, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -0.92983608. The main difference between the two is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the new molecule.

The addition of an alkyl chain generally increases hydrophobicity, which can affect the property value. However, the core structure remains similar, and the examples suggest that such cyclic urea structures tend to have negative property values.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is likely to be slightly less negative than -0.92983608 due to the added hydrophobicity, but still negative. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.85.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group, which is electron-withdrawing, can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups tend to have positive property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of -0.92402201, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.37957867. The presence of multiple halogens in the latter increases the property value compared to the former.

Given that trifluoromethyl is a strong electron-withdrawing group, similar to halogens, we can expect the property value to be positive, but not as high as molecules with multiple electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around 0.3.

The molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a sugar alcohol, specifically a form of glucose, which is a polyol with multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups. In the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a positive property value (0.71144768). This suggests that the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups contributes to a positive property value.

Considering the structural similarity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O will also be positive and similar to the example with multiple hydroxyl groups.

Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately 0.711.

This molecule is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains two ketone groups (C=O) and an ester group (CC(=O)O). These groups are known to influence the electronic properties of the molecule, often contributing to a more negative property value due to their electron-withdrawing nature.

2. **Cyclic Structure**: The molecule has a polycyclic structure, similar to some of the examples provided. For instance, the molecule CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C has a property value of -0.05144579. This suggests that complex cyclic structures with ketone groups tend to have property values around this range.

Both molecules have multiple rings and ketone groups, although the given molecule also includes an ester group, which might slightly influence the property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C is likely to be close to that of similar cyclic ketone-containing structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.05.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is an aromatic compound with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) and an acetamide group (CC(=O)N) attached to a benzene ring. The presence of the nitro group is a significant factor, as it is an electron-withdrawing group, which can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples:
- O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of 0.26361553.
- COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.28133626.
- O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12 has a property value of 0.67248633.

These examples suggest that the presence of a nitro group on an aromatic ring tends to result in a positive property value, but the exact value can vary depending on additional substituents.

The molecule in question also has an acetamide group, which is less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group but can still influence the property value. The combination of these groups suggests a property value that is likely positive but not as high as the more complex aromatic systems with multiple nitro groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O would be around 0.3.

Predicting the property value for the given molecule, CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group, an ester linkage, a thioether, and a chlorinated aromatic ring, along with a heterocyclic structure.

From the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents, such as Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (0.15627258) and Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl (-0.82315985), show a range of property values. The presence of a heterocyclic structure, as seen in CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 (0.92985794), tends to increase the property value. However, the presence of sulfur, as in CSSC (-0.81725035), can decrease the property value.

Considering these factors, the presence of both electron-withdrawing groups (chlorine) and electron-donating groups (ether and thioether), along with the heterocyclic structure, suggests a moderate property value. Balancing these influences, I predict the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 to be approximately:

For instance, CC(C)CO (isobutanol) has a property value of 0.73608297, and CCCCCC(C)O (heptanol) has a property value of -0.0003889. The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) tends to contribute positively to the property value, while the overall structure and branching can influence the magnitude.

Given that tert-butanol is a branched alcohol, similar to isobutanol, we can expect its property value to be positive and possibly close to that of isobutanol. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO would be around 0.7.

In the examples, molecules with halogen groups, such as Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl (-0.82315985), tend to have negative property values, but the context and combination with other groups matter.

3. **Aromatic Ring:** The presence of an aromatic ring is common in many of the examples, and it can contribute to the stability and electronic properties of the molecule.

4. **Alkyl Chain with a Double Bond (CC(C)=C):** This feature is less common in the examples, but it can influence the molecule's overall electronic distribution.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, the presence of multiple nitro groups and a trifluoromethyl group suggests a complex electronic environment. The examples with nitro groups tend to have positive property values, but the combination with the trifluoromethyl group and the specific structure of the molecule could lead to a different outcome.

Given the complexity and the influence of both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, the property value is likely to be slightly positive, but not as high as some of the more straightforward nitro-containing examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately:

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.6492456676204522
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. Esters generally have a range of property values depending on their specific structure. In the examples, we have:

- CC(C)CCOC=O, which is an ester with a property value of -0.31426297.
- CCCCCOC(=O)C, another ester, with a property value of 0.92615113.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is smaller and less complex than these examples, which might suggest a property value closer to zero. However, the presence of the ester functional group and the isopropyl group could influence the property value.

Considering the examples and the structural features of CC(C)OC=O, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be around -0.3, similar to the other small ester example provided.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O is approximately -0.3.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 0.8335984474881905
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is structurally similar to c1ccccc1O (phenol), which has a property value of -0.92782874. The presence of additional methyl groups in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 could slightly alter the property value, but it is likely to remain in a similar range due to the aromatic nature and the presence of the hydroxyl group.

Considering the examples and the structural similarities, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be around -0.9. However, to be more specific, I would predict a property value of approximately -0.92.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.3123149733691457
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is present in several examples. The examples with similar groups are:

1. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, with a property value of -0.11589293
2. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, with a property value of -0.81534656
3. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, with a property value of 0.74054708

The molecule also contains a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) attached to a phenyl ring. The presence of sulfur and methyl groups can influence the property value.

Considering the examples, the presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) in the examples seems to have a significant impact on the property value. The molecule in question does not have halogens but has a thiomethyl group, which might have a different effect.

Given the structural similarities and differences, the property value is likely to be influenced by the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the thiomethyl group. The examples with phosphorothioate groups have a range of property values, but the presence of the thiomethyl group might lead to a value closer to the lower end of the range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is approximately -0.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we can observe that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values. For instance:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.37957867.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.65002068.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is similar in structure to these examples, with multiple chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings. Given the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for this molecule will also be positive and likely within the range of the provided examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately 0.5.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.6827054221516431
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to the end. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative property values, especially when they are attached to aliphatic chains or simple aromatic systems. For instance, CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.8933076, and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.68262515.

Given the simplicity of the molecule CCCN(=O)=O compared to the more complex structures with nitro groups in the examples, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value, likely in the range of the simpler aliphatic nitro compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be approximately -0.85.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.5830808317568394
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent. 

Looking at the examples, we have:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 with a property value of 0.44615456, which is a chlorobenzene with a bromine substituent.
- c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12 with a property value of 0.87178271, which is a brominated biphenyl.

The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, F) in aromatic rings seems to generally result in positive property values. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but with a fluorine instead of a chlorine. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which might slightly affect the property value.

Considering these factors, the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but possibly slightly higher due to the presence of fluorine. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be around 0.5.

True Property: -0.8911421951136449
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with an additional methyl group and a hydroxyl group. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with bicyclic or polycyclic frameworks and alcohol functionalities.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar bicyclic structures and alcohol groups, such as CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO, have property values around -0.90979016. However, this example is more complex and has additional functional groups.

Simpler structures with alcohol groups, like CCCCCCCCC(C)O, have positive property values, such as 0.72850149. The presence of the alcohol group in the target molecule might contribute to a positive property value.

Considering the balance between the bicyclic structure and the alcohol group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 would be slightly positive, but not as high as the linear alcohol example.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 could be around 0.5.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.5731958196316619
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)
- An amide linkage (N2C(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)

Comparing this structure to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of -0.16025531, we notice that both molecules share the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage to a phenyl ring. The main difference is the presence of a thioether (SC(CCl)) in the example, which is not present in the molecule we are predicting.

Given the structural similarities and the absence of the thioether group, which might slightly affect the property value, we can predict that the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O will be close to -0.16025531, but slightly less negative due to the absence of the thioether group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is approximately -0.150.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzamide with a phenyl group attached to a nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of -0.93086697. Both molecules contain aromatic rings and a carbonyl group attached to a nitrogen in a heterocyclic structure.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of aromatic rings and a carbonyl group in a heterocyclic context, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C will be in a similar range to the example provided.

Therefore, I predict the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C to be approximately -0.9.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.12127279503374928
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl ester of heptanoic acid. 

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCCCC(=O)OC, which is a similar ester (methyl ester of heptanoic acid), with a property value of 0.50773362.
- CCCCCCCCI, which is a linear alkane with an iodine atom, with a property value of -0.31136695.
- CCCCC, a linear alkane, with a property value of -0.32799379.

The presence of the ester functional group tends to increase the property value compared to simple alkanes. The example of CCCCCCC(=O)OC has a positive property value, indicating that the ester group contributes positively to the property in question.

Given that CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar to CCCCCCC(=O)OC but with an ethyl group instead of a methyl group, we can expect a similar positive contribution from the ester group. The additional carbon in the ethyl group might slightly alter the property value, but it is likely to remain in the same range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be slightly higher than 0.50773362, but still positive. A predicted value could be around 0.52.

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.7988918257921259
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is methyl benzoate, an ester with a benzene ring. In the examples, we have several molecules with aromatic rings and ester groups:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1, -0.91861587
2. CCOC(=O)c1cncn1C(C)c2ccccc2, 0.92418983
3. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, -0.64228543

The third example, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, is ethyl benzoate, which is structurally very similar to methyl benzoate, differing only by one carbon in the alkyl chain of the ester group. The property value for ethyl benzoate is -0.64228543.

Given the structural similarity, we can predict that the property value for methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1) will be close to that of ethyl benzoate. Since methyl benzoate has a slightly smaller alkyl group, it might have a slightly different value, but it should be in the same range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.65.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.2635393863748423
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the overall molecular structure.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear conjugated diene, which is similar to the example C=Cc1ccccc1 (styrene) with a property value of 0.92891711. Conjugated systems, especially those with aromatic or extended pi systems, tend to have higher property values in the given examples.

Considering the linear conjugated diene structure of C=CCC=C, which lacks the aromatic stabilization of styrene but still benefits from conjugation, we can predict a property value that is positive but likely lower than that of styrene.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C would be around 0.5.

True Property: -0.5960067186075495
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is tribromomethane, also known as bromoform. It is a simple molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples provided, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly bromine, tend to have positive property values. For instance, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of 0.87178271, and Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of 0.15627258.

Given the simplicity of BrC(Br)Br and the presence of multiple bromine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. However, due to the lack of aromatic or complex structures, the value might not be as high as those with aromatic rings.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -0.6995124.
- A thioester linkage (SC(CCl)), which is somewhat similar to the thioester linkage in CCSC(=O)N(CC)C1CCCCC1, which has a property value of -0.62895424.
- An amide linkage (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O), which is similar to the amide linkage in CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccccc1, which has a property value of 0.22341336.

Considering these structural similarities and the fact that the molecule has both electron-withdrawing groups (like the phosphorothioate and thioester) and an amide linkage, the property value is likely to be negative, as seen in the examples with similar functional groups.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around -0.65.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.15211657813633317
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves analyzing the functional groups, molecular size, and other structural features that might influence the property in question. The examples provided suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, aromaticity, and possibly steric effects.

The molecule in question, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, contains several key features:
- An amide group (C(=O)N)
- A chloro-substituted aromatic ring
- A heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen atoms
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

From the examples, molecules with chloro-substituted aromatic rings and heterocycles tend to have negative property values, especially when combined with other electron-withdrawing groups like carbonyls. The presence of the tert-butyl group might slightly offset this due to its electron-donating nature, but the overall influence of the electron-withdrawing groups is likely to dominate.

Considering these factors, I would predict the property value for CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C to be slightly negative, around -0.5.

True Property: 0.8711185081985374
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which has two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with chlorine substituents on each ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a property value of 0.72793934. The presence of an additional phenyl ring connected via an ether linkage and an extra chlorine atom might influence the property value.

Considering the examples, molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have property values that are positive but can vary depending on the specific arrangement and additional functional groups. The presence of the ether linkage might slightly reduce the property value compared to a simple dichlorobenzene.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be around 0.6.

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.29596385604295766

To predict the property value for the molecule CC/C=C\C, we can look at the examples provided and identify similar structures and their associated property values. The molecule CC/C=C\C is a linear alkene with four carbon atoms, also known as 2-butene.

In the examples, the molecule CC/C=C/C, which is also a linear alkene with four carbon atoms (2-butene), has a property value of -0.29596386. Since CC/C=C\C is essentially the same molecule as CC/C=C/C, just with a different stereochemistry (cis vs. trans), we can reasonably predict that the property value for CC/C=C\C will be very similar to that of CC/C=C/C.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C is approximately -0.29596386.

True Property: -0.7709830959959918
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their corresponding property values.

The molecule CCCOCC is a linear chain with an ether functional group. In the examples, linear alkanes and ethers tend to have property values around zero, with some variation depending on the specific structure and functional groups present.

For instance:
- C (methane) has a property value of 0.47381164.
- CCC#C (butyne) has a property value of 0.84531391.
- CCC(O)CC (pentanol) has a property value of -0.72923843.
- C1CCCCCC1 (cyclohexane) has a property value of -0.01386084.

Considering the structure of CCCOCC, which is a simple ether with no additional functional groups that might significantly alter its property value, it is reasonable to predict a property value close to zero, similar to other simple alkanes and ethers.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOCC is approximately 0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a tertiary amide with two phenyl rings and a tert-butyl group. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings and amide linkages. For instance, the molecule CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 has a property value of 0.92985794, and CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1 has a property value of 0.90067748. Both of these molecules contain aromatic rings and amide groups, which are also present in the molecule we are analyzing.

Given the presence of aromatic rings and the amide group, which tend to contribute positively to the property value in the examples, and considering the tert-butyl group which can also have a positive influence, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value for this molecule.

Based on the structural similarities and the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be approximately 0.9.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-), which is a common feature in several molecules with varying property values.
- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1), which is similar to the structure in Fc1cccc(Br)c1 with a property value of 0.58308083 and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 with a property value of 0.90573897.

Considering the presence of the bromobenzene moiety, which tends to have positive property values in the examples, and the acetamide group, which can have a neutral to slightly negative influence, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to be positive but not as high as the bromobenzene examples due to the influence of the acetamide group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around 0.7.

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.9131615067345056
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is isobutylbenzene, which consists of an isobutyl group (CC(C)C) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1).

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings, such as benzene derivatives, tend to have higher property values. For instance, Cc1ccccc1N has a property value of 0.88484336, and C=Cc1ccccc1 has a property value of 0.92891711. These examples suggest that the presence of an aromatic ring contributes positively to the property value.

Additionally, the presence of alkyl groups like isobutyl (CC(C)C) can also influence the property value. For example, CC(C)CO has a property value of 0.73608297, indicating that the isobutyl group itself can contribute positively to the property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 combines both an aromatic ring and an isobutyl group, which are both associated with higher property values in the examples provided. Therefore, we can predict that the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 will be relatively high, similar to other aromatic compounds with alkyl groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is approximately 0.85.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:

1. Aromatic rings (like benzene) often have positive property values, as seen in examples like COc1ccccc1 (0.22790347) and c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45 (0.4459946).

2. The presence of electron-withdrawing groups, such as carbonyls (C=O), can influence the property value. For instance, NC(=O)c1ccccc1O has a positive value (0.92658847), and O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a positive value (0.24582639).

3. The presence of an aldehyde group (C=O) in benzaldehyde is similar to the carbonyl group in NC(=O)c1ccccc1O, which has a high positive value.

Considering these observations, benzaldehyde is likely to have a positive property value due to the aromatic ring and the electron-withdrawing effect of the aldehyde group. Based on the trends from the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 would be around 0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring, similar to some of the examples. The presence of the nitro group (N(=O)=O) and the heterocyclic structure (a lactam ring) suggests that the property value might be negative, as seen in some examples with similar functional groups.

For instance, the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 has a property value of -0.48359786, and it contains a heterocyclic structure with an oxygen and a nitrogen atom. The presence of the nitro group in the target molecule might further decrease the property value, as seen in other examples with nitro groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.5. However, given the specific examples and the influence of the nitro group, a slightly more negative value might be appropriate.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is approximately -0.6.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.9120458313247627
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is a diarylamine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a nitrogen atom. This structure is similar to the example N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -0.16362273. The main difference between the two is the presence of a double-bonded nitrogen in the example, which is not present in the molecule we are analyzing.

Considering the structural similarity and the fact that the example has a slightly negative property value, we can infer that the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 will also have a negative property value, but likely closer to zero due to the absence of the double-bonded nitrogen, which might contribute to a more negative value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be around -0.1.

In the examples, similar cyclic structures with amide groups, such as O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, have negative property values. Additionally, the presence of amide groups often contributes to a negative property value due to their polar nature.

Considering these factors and the trends observed in the examples, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be negative. A reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.6.

- C=Cc1ccccc1 has a property value of 0.92891711.

These examples suggest that the presence of chlorine atoms and aromatic rings contributes to a higher property value. Given that the target molecule has three chlorine atoms and two aromatic rings, it is reasonable to predict a high property value, similar to the examples with similar structural features.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately 0.93.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions tend to have positive property values. For instance, Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) has a property value of 0.88484336, and CCc1ccccn1 (ethylpyridine) has a property value of 0.43690796. These examples suggest that the presence of an aromatic ring with alkyl groups contributes to a positive property value.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a diethylbenzene, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be positive, likely in a similar range to the other alkyl-substituted aromatics. Considering the examples and the structure of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be around 0.5.

One of the examples, Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, has a nitro group attached to a phenyl ring and has a property value of 0.84482329. The sulfonamide group in the target molecule is somewhat similar in electronic nature to the nitro group, as both are electron-withdrawing groups. However, the sulfonamide group is generally less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group.

Considering the structural similarity and the electronic effects, the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is likely to be positive but slightly lower than that of the nitro-substituted benzene.

Looking at the examples, we see that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as c1cccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54, have a property value of 0.86263905. This suggests that aromaticity and the presence of multiple fused benzene rings contribute to a higher property value.

Given the structural similarity of triphenylene to the example with a high property value, we can predict that the property value for c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 will also be relatively high. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 0.85.

- A thioester linkage (SC), which is not directly present in the examples but can be considered similar to sulfur-containing groups.

Considering these features, the presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a positive contribution to the property value, while the amide group might contribute negatively based on the examples. The overall structure is relatively simple compared to some of the more complex molecules with negative values.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be slightly positive, but not as high as the example with the chlorinated aromatic ring. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.1.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is a simple alkene with two chlorine atoms attached to the carbon-carbon double bond. This structure is relatively simple compared to many of the examples provided, which include more complex functional groups and larger ring systems.

From the examples, simpler molecules with halogen substituents, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, tend to have positive property values. However, the presence of a double bond and the specific arrangement of chlorine atoms in Cl\C=C/Cl might influence the property value differently.

Considering the simplicity of the molecule and the presence of electron-withdrawing chlorine atoms, the property value is likely to be positive but not as high as those with more complex aromatic systems. Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around 0.5.

The presence of nitrogen in the aromatic ring seems to influence the property value, often resulting in a positive or slightly negative value.

Considering pyridine's structure and comparing it to similar aromatic nitrogen-containing compounds, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be slightly positive, reflecting the influence of the nitrogen atom.

Therefore, the predicted property value for c1ccncc1 (pyridine) is approximately 0.1.

- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)
- An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (cc(Cl)ccc23)
- Hydroxyl groups (OCC(O)CO)

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens (like Cl) tend to have negative property values, especially when multiple halogens are present.
- Molecules with ester and amide linkages can have varying property values, but the presence of additional aromatic rings and halogens often leads to more negative values.
- Hydroxyl groups can contribute to positive property values, but their effect can be overshadowed by the presence of halogens and aromatic systems.

Considering these observations, the presence of multiple aromatic rings, a chlorine atom, and the ester and amide linkages in the molecule suggests a property value that is likely negative. The hydroxyl groups may slightly mitigate this effect, but not enough to make the overall property positive.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 would be around -0.5.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Linear alkanes and alcohols tend to have positive property values. For instance, OC1CCCCCCC1 (a cyclic alcohol) has a property value of 0.68100795, and CC(C)CC(C)(C)O (a branched alcohol) has a property value of 0.90109162.

2. The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) in alcohols generally contributes to a positive property value.

3. The length of the carbon chain and the presence of functional groups like hydroxyls can influence the property value.

Considering these observations, CCCCCO, being a linear alcohol with a moderate chain length, is likely to have a positive property value. Based on the trends from the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be around 0.7.

- An ether linkage (CCO), which can add some polarity.

From the examples, molecules with polar groups like sulfonyl and amide tend to have negative property values, indicating a more polar or electron-withdrawing nature. For instance, molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) or multiple halogens often have negative values.

Considering these factors, the presence of both the sulfonyl and amide groups, along with the aromatic ring, suggests a property value that is likely negative, reflecting the polar and electron-withdrawing nature of the molecule.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be around -0.7.

This molecule contains several functional groups and structural features that can influence its property value:

1. **Ester Groups (COC(=O))**: Esters are present in the molecule, which can contribute to a moderate property value, as seen in some examples.

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The presence of a nitro group is significant, as it often contributes to a higher property value. In the examples, nitro groups are associated with positive property values.

3. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: Aromatic rings are common in the examples and can contribute to a range of property values, often depending on the substituents attached.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring (C1=C(C)NC)**: The presence of a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen can also influence the property value, often contributing to a moderate to high value.

5. **Substituents (C, C(=O)OC)**: The presence of additional carbon groups and ester functionalities can further modulate the property value.

Considering these structural features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule has characteristics that suggest a moderate to high property value. The presence of the nitro group and ester functionalities, along with the aromatic and heterocyclic rings, are key contributors.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately **0.75**.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two amide groups and a cyclohexane-like structure due to the cyclization of the peptide bond. This structure is relatively polar due to the presence of carbonyl and amide groups, which can engage in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions.

Looking at the examples, molecules with polar functional groups like carbonyls and amides tend to have negative property values. For instance, molecules like CCC(C)C(=O)OC2CC(C)C=C3C=CC(C)C(CCC1CC(O)CC(=O)O1)C23 and OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O have negative values, indicating that the presence of carbonyl and amide groups contributes to a negative property value.

Given the structural similarity of the diketopiperazine to these examples, particularly in terms of polarity and functional groups, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for this molecule.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.7, considering the trends observed in the examples.

To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups and the overall molecular size and complexity.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure, consisting of a chloroethane (ethyl chloride) group. In the examples, simple aliphatic hydrocarbons like CCCCC have a property value of -0.32799379, while aromatic compounds and more complex structures tend to have higher or more positive values. Halogenated compounds like Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) have a property value of -0.32072297, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (hexachlorobenzene) has a value of -0.66343734.

Given that ClCC is a small, simple, halogenated aliphatic compound, we can expect its property value to be negative, similar to other small halogenated compounds. Considering the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be around -0.4. However, since ClCC is simpler than the aromatic halogenated compounds, it might be slightly less negative.

Therefore, a predicted property value for ClCC could be approximately -0.35.

This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with chlorinated aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups.

For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.70623812, and Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2 has a property value of -0.10206406. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms and the pyridine nitrogen in the target molecule suggests a strong electron-withdrawing effect, which could influence the property value.

Considering these factors and the trends observed in the examples, the predicted property value for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is likely to be positive and relatively high, similar to other highly chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is approximately 0.85.

To predict the property value for the molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is 1,4-dibromobenzene, which is an aromatic compound with two bromine atoms attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values. For instance, ClC(Cl)Cl has a property value of 0.84411086, and CI has a property value of 0.92439306. These examples suggest that the presence of halogens, particularly bromine and iodine, contributes to a positive property value.

Given that 1,4-dibromobenzene is similar in nature to these halogenated compounds, we can reasonably predict that its property value will also be positive. Considering the trend and the influence of bromine, a heavier halogen than chlorine, the property value is likely to be in the higher positive range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately 0.9.

Given the trend that increased chlorination tends to increase the property value, and considering the structural similarity to the example, we can predict that the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl will be slightly lower than 0.87210328 due to fewer chlorine atoms.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately 0.75.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1

This molecule contains:

1. Aromatic rings: Three phenyl rings, which are common in the examples.
2. Phosphoryl group: The presence of a P(=O)(O)O group, which is not directly seen in the examples but can be related to other polar functional groups.
3. Alkyl groups: Methyl groups attached to the aromatic rings.

From the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and polar functional groups (like carbonyls, nitro groups, etc.) tend to have a range of property values, often negative or slightly positive. The presence of multiple aromatic rings and the phosphoryl group suggests a potential for a slightly positive property value, as seen in some examples with similar complexity and functional groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 0.2 to 0.3. Therefore, a specific predicted property value could be:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is electron-withdrawing and can influence the electronic properties of the molecule.
- An aromatic ring, which is common in many of the examples.
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle, which can affect the polarity and electronic distribution.
- Chlorine atoms, which are also electron-withdrawing and can impact the molecule's properties.

Looking at the examples, molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (NO2), trifluoromethyl (CF3), and halogens (Cl, Br) tend to have negative property values. However, the presence of aromatic rings and certain heterocycles can sometimes lead to positive values, depending on the overall balance of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects.

Given the presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups (CF3 and Cl) and the nitrogen-containing heterocycle, the property value is likely to be negative, but not extremely so, as the aromatic ring and heterocycle can moderate the effect.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O would be around -0.5.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.2813362621669994
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (CO) attached to a benzene ring, with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) also attached to the ring.

From the examples, we can identify some relevant patterns:

1. Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have negative property values. For instance, O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.24582639, and Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2 has a property value of -0.8510483.

2. The presence of a methoxy group (CO) on an aromatic ring, as seen in COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC, which has a property value of 0.21402858, suggests a slight positive influence, but this is counteracted by the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group.

Considering these factors, the nitro group is likely to have a more dominant effect, leading to a negative property value. However, the methoxy group may slightly mitigate this effect compared to a molecule with only nitro groups.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be slightly negative, but not as negative as molecules with multiple nitro groups or without the methoxy group. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of -0.43158105. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally contributes to a negative property value, as seen in the examples.

Given the high degree of chlorination and the structural similarity to the example with a negative property value, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for this molecule will also be negative. Considering the extent of chlorination and the complexity of the structure, the property value is likely to be more negative than -0.43158105.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl would be approximately -0.600.

1. Linear alkanes and simple alkyl chains tend to have positive property values, as seen with CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 (0.72913062) and CCC1CCCCC1 (0.91484835).
2. The presence of an ester group, as in CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C (-0.92869751), can influence the property value, but this example is more complex and contains additional functional groups that likely contribute to the negative value.
3. Simpler esters like CCCOC (0.6791086) have positive values, suggesting that the ester group in a less complex molecule contributes positively.

Considering these points, the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is a relatively simple ester with a long alkyl chain, which should result in a positive property value. Given the trend observed in similar structures, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.7. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 0.7.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to the example Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (a nitrophenol) with a property value of 0.74816929. The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) on the benzene ring tends to increase the property value, as seen in the nitrophenol example. However, the presence of a chlorine atom (Cl) can have a varying effect depending on its position and the overall structure.

In the examples, molecules with chlorine atoms on benzene rings, such as Clc1ccccc1I and Clc1cccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, have negative property values, but these are more complex structures with multiple chlorine atoms.

The structure of CCCCCOC=O is similar to CCCCCCC=O, but with one fewer carbon in the chain. The presence of the ester functional group (OC=O) is a key feature, and the overall structure suggests it might have a similar property value, though slightly different due to the shorter chain length.

Given the examples, the property values for linear aliphatic esters and ketones tend to be negative, and the value becomes more negative with longer carbon chains. Since CCCCCOC=O has a shorter chain than CCCCCCC=O, we can expect its property value to be slightly less negative.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be around -0.60.

The presence of multiple chlorine atoms often correlates with negative values, likely due to their electron-withdrawing nature and impact on molecular polarity.

Given this pattern, and considering the simplicity and high chlorine content of ClCCl, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Based on the examples, a value around -0.6 to -0.9 seems plausible for molecules with multiple chlorine atoms.

Predicting the property value for the given molecule involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be quite complex, with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and a significant degree of oxygenation, which suggests a high degree of polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. These features are often associated with higher property values in the examples provided.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, the molecule is likely to have a property value on the higher end of the scale, similar to other highly oxygenated and complex structures in the examples.

Based on the analysis of the examples and the structural features of the given molecule, I would predict a property value of approximately **0.85**.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.1147798998014915
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thioether group (CS), a pyrazole ring (nnc), a carbonyl group (C=O), and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some similar structural features:

1. CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a pyrazole ring and a tert-butyl group, with a property value of 0.15495387.
2. C1SC(=S)NC1(=O) has a thioether group and a carbonyl group, with a property value of 0.29887534.

The presence of a pyrazole ring and a tert-butyl group in the first example suggests a positive contribution to the property value. The thioether and carbonyl groups in the second example also suggest a positive contribution, though the context is slightly different.

Considering these structural similarities and their associated property values, we can predict that the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C will likely have a positive property value, possibly in the range of the examples provided.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is approximately 0.25.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6422854335365197
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is an ethyl benzoate, which is an ester derived from benzoic acid and ethanol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Esters like CCCCCC(=O)OC have a property value of 0.92615113.
2. Aromatic compounds like o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 have a property value of 0.83793166.
3. The presence of an aromatic ring generally contributes positively to the property value, as seen in several examples.

Given that CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ester with an aromatic ring, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. The closest example in terms of structure is CCCCCC(=O)OC, which is also an ester and has a positive property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around 0.92615113, similar to the other ester example provided.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.6815542481957251
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, aromatic rings, and halogens.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached. In the examples, linear alkyl chains with functional groups such as alcohols (e.g., CCCCCCCCO) have positive property values, while those with carbonyl groups (e.g., CCCCC(=O)C) also have positive values. The presence of a bromine atom, as seen in Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, is associated with a positive property value.

Considering these observations, the presence of a bromine atom in CCCCCCCBr is likely to contribute positively to the property value, similar to the example with the aromatic bromine compound. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be positive and similar to other linear alkyl chains with halogens.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr is approximately 0.87178271, similar to the example with the aromatic bromine compound.

SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.013407088032965322
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide) based on the given examples is challenging without additional context on what the property represents. However, I can make an educated guess based on the nature of CO and the trends observed in the examples.

Carbon monoxide is a small, linear molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is non-polar and has a relatively simple structure compared to the more complex molecules listed. In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules tend to have property values closer to zero, with some exceptions based on specific functional groups or structural features.

Given this, I would predict that the property value for CO is likely to be close to zero, but slightly positive or negative due to its small size and simple structure. A reasonable estimate might be around 0.1 or -0.1. However, without knowing the exact nature of the property being measured, this is a speculative prediction.
