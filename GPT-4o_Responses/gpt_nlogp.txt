Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxo group and a nitrogen atom. This structure is somewhat similar to other aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro or carbonyl groups, which tend to have negative property values in the examples.

For instance, the molecule Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C has a property value of -0.74276088, and it contains a similar heterocyclic structure with a carbonyl group and a chlorine atom. Another example is NC(=O)c1ccccc1O, which has a property value of -1.26434518, and it also contains an aromatic ring with electron-withdrawing groups.

Considering these comparisons, the predicted property value for Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is likely to be negative, reflecting the influence of the electron-withdrawing groups and the aromatic nature of the compound.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.1409143248399483
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an isopropyl group (CC(C)). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, tend to have negative property values. This is likely due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group, which can affect the overall electronic properties of the molecule.

Given this analysis and the trend observed in the examples, I would predict that the property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative. A reasonable estimate, considering the examples, would be around -1.5.

- A chlorobenzene moiety, similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 0.44774473.

The combination of these features suggests a balance between positive contributions from the aromatic rings and negative contributions from the amide groups. The presence of both electron-withdrawing groups (F and Cl) and the amide linkage suggests a property value that is likely to be slightly negative or close to zero.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be around -0.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with two carbonyl groups and a bromine atom. The presence of carbonyl groups typically contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in molecules like O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC (-1.49170699) and CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (0.04686814). The presence of a bromine atom, as in CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, also suggests a slight increase in the property value compared to similar structures without bromine.

Considering these factors, the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative, influenced by the carbonyl groups, but not as negative as those with multiple carbonyls or highly polar groups. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.2 to -0.4.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O is approximately -0.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a physicochemical property such as hydrophobicity or a related descriptor.

Biphenyl is an aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples, aromatic compounds with multiple rings tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67, which is a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a high property value of 3.13380257. Similarly, Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34, another polycyclic aromatic compound, has a property value of 1.63484299.

Given that biphenyl is a simpler aromatic compound with two phenyl rings, its property value is likely to be lower than those of larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but higher than that of simpler, non-aromatic compounds. The molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, which is a chlorinated biphenyl derivative, has a property value of 2.84390428. Since biphenyl lacks the additional chlorine atoms, its property value should be somewhat lower.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around 1.5. This value reflects its aromatic nature and the presence of two phenyl rings, placing it between simpler aromatic compounds and more complex polycyclic structures.

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.4260553823555239
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, aromaticity, and the overall size and shape of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear alkane chain with a sulfur atom at the end. In the examples, linear alkanes like CCCCCCC=C (0.81687413) and CCCCCCC(C)C (0.60463328) have positive property values. The presence of sulfur, which is less electronegative than oxygen and nitrogen, might slightly reduce the property value compared to a similar hydrocarbon without sulfur.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCCCS is likely to be positive but slightly lower than that of a similar hydrocarbon without sulfur. A reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be around 0.5.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol, specifically 2-methyl-2-pentanol. In the examples, we have several aliphatic and branched hydrocarbons, as well as alcohols, which can help us make a prediction:

1. CCC(C)(C)C (2,2-dimethylbutane) has a property value of 0.77294807.
2. CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O (a cyclic alcohol) has a property value of 0.06876275.
3. CCC(C)(C)C (2,2-dimethylbutane) has a property value of 0.77294807.
4. CCCC(C)(O)CC (a branched alcohol) has a property value of -0.26786684.

The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) in CCCC(C)(C)CO suggests that its property value might be closer to other alcohols rather than purely aliphatic hydrocarbons. The example of CCCC(C)(O)CC, which is a similar branched alcohol, has a property value of -0.26786684. 

Considering the structural similarity and the influence of the hydroxyl group, the predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is likely to be close to that of CCCC(C)(O)CC. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO is approximately -0.26786684.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (1.3427005): This is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a methyl group, similar to 1-methyl-naphthalene.
- Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (0.76469654): This is another polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a methyl group.

Both of these examples have relatively high property values, indicating that the presence of polycyclic aromatic structures with methyl groups tends to increase the property value.

Given the structural similarity of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 to these examples, particularly to Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1, we can predict that the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 will be in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately 1.3427005, as it closely resembles the structure of the first example.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a cyclic compound with a urea-like structure (a diketopiperazine) and an alkyl side chain. The examples show that similar cyclic structures with carbonyl groups and alkyl chains tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a property value of -1.64496925, which is a similar structure with a different side chain.

Considering the structural similarities and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is likely to be in the negative range, similar to the example with a value of -1.64496925. Given the slightly larger alkyl group, the value might be slightly less negative, but still in the same range.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have positive property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of 0.41435545, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 3.37655904. The presence of multiple halogens, especially fluorine, which is highly electronegative, can increase the property value.

Considering the structure of trifluoromethylbenzene and the trends observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value for this molecule. Given the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the trifluoromethyl group, the property value is likely to be moderately positive.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is approximately 0.5.

This structure is similar to the example OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, which has a property value of -4.05351294. Both molecules are polyols with multiple hydroxyl groups, which contribute to their hydrophilicity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Given the structural similarity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O will be similar to that of OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO. Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately -4.05351294.

CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C

This molecule is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Cyclic Structure**: The molecule has a polycyclic structure similar to some of the examples provided, such as CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of 1.71126886. This suggests that the presence of multiple rings and ketone groups contributes positively to the property value.

2. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains ketone groups (C=O) and an ester group (CC(=O)O). The presence of these groups is similar to the example CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O, which has a negative property value of -1.25757153. However, the overall structure and the number of rings in the current molecule are more similar to the example with a positive property value.

3. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (C3(O) and C(O)) can influence the property value. In the example OCC3OC(OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C(O)C3O, the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups contributes to a negative property value of -3.72688644. However, in the current molecule, the hydroxyl groups are part of a complex cyclic structure, which may not have the same effect.

Considering these factors, the molecule's complex polycyclic structure with ketone and ester groups suggests a positive property value, similar to the example with a value of 1.71126886. However, the presence of hydroxyl groups and the specific arrangement of the rings may slightly reduce this value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is an aromatic compound with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) and an acetamide group (CC(=O)N) attached to a benzene ring. The presence of the nitro group is known to generally decrease the property value, as seen in several examples like O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (-0.50918647) and COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (-0.5033023).

The acetamide group (CC(=O)N) is a polar group that can also contribute to a decrease in the property value, similar to other carbonyl-containing groups in the examples.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property value, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative and similar to the values of other nitro-containing aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)SC)
- A chloro-substituted aromatic ring
- A heterocyclic structure with a lactone (n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12)

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with chloro-substituted aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, such as Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (0.78971113) and Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl (1.58831695).
- Molecules with heterocyclic structures and additional functional groups like carbonyls or esters can have varying property values, often influenced by the presence of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups.

Considering these factors, the presence of the chloro-substituted aromatic ring and the phosphorothioate group, which might contribute to a more complex electronic environment, suggests a property value that is likely positive but not extremely high due to the balance of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CC(C)(C)CO is tert-butanol, which is a simple alcohol with a tertiary carbon structure.

For instance, CCC (propane) has a property value of -0.63131733, and CC(C)CO (isobutanol) has a property value of -1.16609312. The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) in alcohols generally contributes to a more negative property value compared to alkanes.

Given that tert-butanol is similar to isobutanol but with a slightly different branching, we can expect its property value to be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO (tert-butanol) would be around -1.0 to -1.2.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value for CC(C)(C)CO to be approximately:

These values suggest that the presence of nitrogen heterocycles and conjugation contributes to a more negative property value.

Given the structural similarity of O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 to these examples, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Considering the degree of conjugation and the presence of nitrogen atoms, a value in the range of the examples with similar features is expected.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, an ester. Esters in the examples tend to have negative property values, likely due to their polar nature and the presence of electronegative oxygen atoms. For instance, CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC has a property value of -0.09236788, and CCCOC(C)C has a property value of -0.35414528. Both of these molecules contain ester functional groups and have negative property values.

Given that CC(C)OC=O is a small ester, similar to the examples, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Considering the examples and the structural similarity, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around -0.3.

Considering the presence of two phenyl rings and the urea linkage, the molecule is likely to have a property value that reflects the influence of these aromatic systems and the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl groups. The examples suggest that such structures tend to have negative property values, often influenced by the electron-withdrawing groups and the aromaticity.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 would be around -1.0, considering the influence of the urea linkage and the aromatic rings. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is:

To predict the property value for the molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The given molecule is triphenylene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a planar structure composed of four fused benzene rings.

From the examples, we observe that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1, which is a larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a property value of 1.92070446. Similarly, other aromatic compounds with multiple rings, such as N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, have a property value of 1.20625604.

Given that triphenylene is a smaller polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compared to the example with a property value of 1.92070446, but still larger than simple aromatic compounds, we can predict that its property value will be significant but not as high as the largest polycyclic example.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (triphenylene) would be around 1.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. This molecule contains a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N), an aromatic ring, and an amine group. 

From the examples, molecules with sulfonamide groups and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values, often due to their polar nature and potential for hydrogen bonding. For instance, the molecule O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O has a property value of -1.20290343, and it contains a sulfonamide-like group and aromatic features.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is likely to be negative. Based on the trends observed, a reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -1.0.

True Property: 1.084604130576485
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is known to generally decrease the property value (as seen in examples like Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O with a property of -0.71061686).
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) attached to the aromatic ring, which can increase the property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature (similar to the effect seen in Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O with a property of 0.47805508).
- An alkyl chain with a double bond (CC(C)=C), which can slightly increase the property value (as seen in aliphatic chains like CCCCCCCCC with a property of 0.97013638).

Considering these factors, the presence of two nitro groups is likely to have a significant negative impact on the property value, while the trifluoromethyl group and the alkyl chain with a double bond may counteract this to some extent. However, the overall effect is expected to be negative due to the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro groups.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around -0.5.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -1.2118665380248972
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. It has a relatively simple structure with a small alkyl group (isopropyl) and a formate group. In the examples, simple esters and small molecules with similar functional groups tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCC(C)(C)O has a property value of -0.80168475, and CC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of -0.77554806.

Considering the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O is likely to be negative and close to those of similar small esters.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O is approximately -0.78.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the examples given.

1. **Structural Analysis**: The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a phenol with a methyl group attached to the benzene ring. This structure is similar to c1ccccc1O (phenol), which has a property value of -0.64780671.

2. **Substituent Effects**: The addition of a methyl group (electron-donating group) to the phenol ring can slightly increase the property value compared to phenol alone. In the examples, methyl groups generally increase the property value slightly, as seen in Cc1cccc(C)c1 (0.14944438) compared to c1ccccc1 (benzene, not directly listed but typically around 0).

3. **Comparison with Similar Structures**: The molecule c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC (a more complex phenol derivative) has a property value of 0.60319644, indicating that additional alkyl groups can significantly increase the property value.

Considering these points, the presence of the methyl group in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is likely to increase the property value compared to phenol (c1ccccc1O, -0.64780671), but not as much as more complex alkylated phenols.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be slightly higher than -0.64780671, possibly around -0.5 to -0.4. Given the trend and the examples, a specific prediction could be:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)O), which is similar to the phosphorothioate groups in the examples COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl. These examples have property values of 1.58256962, 1.47453341, and 1.50792269, respectively. These values are relatively high, indicating that the presence of the phosphorothioate group contributes positively to the property value.

Additionally, the molecule contains a thiomethyl group (SC) attached to the aromatic ring. This is a less common feature in the examples, but it can be considered to have a moderate effect on the property value.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of the phosphorothioate group, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be in the range of the examples with similar groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 1.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound, specifically a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) derivative. The examples show that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have high property values. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 3.37655904, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has an even higher value of 3.82361956.

Given that the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is also a highly chlorinated aromatic compound, we can expect its property value to be relatively high, though likely not as high as the most chlorinated example provided.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 3.0.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -1.1398195944532952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to the end. The presence of the nitro group is significant because it is an electron-withdrawing group, which generally contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in some of the examples with nitro groups.

For instance, the molecule CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a property value of 1.23786638, but it is a much larger and more complex structure with multiple nitro groups and other electron-withdrawing groups like trifluoromethyl. In contrast, simpler structures with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.63480678.

Given the simplicity of CCCN(=O)=O and the presence of a single nitro group, we can expect the property value to be negative but not as extreme as more complex or highly substituted nitro compounds. Comparing with the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around -0.5 to -0.7.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O is approximately -0.65.

True Property: 0.17050425772120847
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene ring with a bromine substituent. 

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Halogenated benzene rings (e.g., Clc1ccc(Br)cc1) tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of multiple halogens, especially heavier ones like bromine, tends to increase the property value.
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like fluorine can also influence the property value.

Given these observations, the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is expected to have a positive property value, similar to other halogenated aromatic compounds. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be around 0.8, considering the influence of both fluorine and bromine on the aromatic ring.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic structure with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane system with a hydroxyl group, which is similar to a norbornane derivative. The presence of the hydroxyl group can influence the property value, typically making it more negative due to increased polarity and potential hydrogen bonding.

Looking at the examples, molecules with alcohol groups, such as CCCCC(C)(C)O (-0.53477579) and CC(C)(C)CO (-0.89918417), tend to have negative property values. The bicyclic structure might add some complexity, but the overall influence of the alcohol group is likely to dominate.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 would be around -0.5 to -0.9. Given the examples and the structural features, a specific prediction could be:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), an ester linkage (OCC), and a bicyclic lactam structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O). This structure is somewhat similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 1.05313063. The main difference is the presence of a sulfur atom in the example, which is replaced by a nitrogen atom in the molecule in question.

Considering the structural similarity and the fact that the sulfur atom is replaced by a nitrogen atom, which might slightly decrease the property value due to the difference in electronegativity and bonding characteristics, we can predict a slightly lower property value than 1.05313063.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be approximately 0.95.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzamide-like structure with a phenyl group attached to a nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of 0.45399838. Both molecules contain aromatic rings and a carbonyl group attached to a nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring.

Considering the structural similarities and the presence of aromatic rings and a carbonyl group, the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is likely to be in a similar range. However, the specific substitution pattern and the presence of an additional methyl group may slightly alter the property value.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C to be approximately 0.4.

True Property: -0.14313599805488286
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which consists of a heptanoic acid moiety (CCCCCCC(=O)O) and an ethyl group (CC).

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCCCC(=O)OC, which is a similar ester with a methyl group instead of an ethyl group, has a property value of 0.39068191.
- CCCCCCCI, which is a heptane derivative with an iodine atom, has a property value of 0.72033259.

The presence of the ester functional group typically results in a property value that is slightly positive or close to zero, as seen in the example of CCCCCCC(=O)OC. The addition of an ethyl group instead of a methyl group might slightly increase the property value due to the increased hydrophobicity and molecular size.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is likely to be slightly higher than that of CCCCCCC(=O)OC. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be approximately 0.45.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is methyl benzoate, which is an ester derived from benzoic acid.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Aromatic compounds with halogens or electron-withdrawing groups tend to have positive property values.
2. Esters and ketones generally have negative property values, especially when they are not heavily substituted with electron-withdrawing groups.
3. The presence of an ester group, as seen in CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 (-0.52690742) and CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (-0.32547703), suggests a negative property value.

Given that COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is a simple aromatic ester without additional electron-withdrawing groups, it is reasonable to predict a property value similar to other esters with aromatic rings.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.325.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly indicating a physicochemical property such as logP (partition coefficient), which is influenced by the presence of polar and nonpolar groups, molecular size, and shape.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, also known as 1,3-butadiene. It is a relatively small and nonpolar molecule. In the examples, small nonpolar hydrocarbons like CCC(C)(C)CC have a property value of 0.33772432, while slightly larger or more complex hydrocarbons like CCCc1ccccc1 have a property value of 0.20533037.

Given that C=CCC=C is a small, nonpolar hydrocarbon, we can expect its property value to be similar to those of other small hydrocarbons. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C would be around 0.1 to 0.3. Considering the examples, a specific prediction could be:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular size and complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is tribromomethane, also known as bromoform. It is a small, simple molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples provided, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly bromine, tend to have positive property values. For instance, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of 0.86435806, and Ic1cccc2ccccc12 has a property value of 0.75632186. These examples suggest that the presence of bromine and iodine contributes to a positive property value.

Given that BrC(Br)Br is a small molecule with three bromine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value, likely influenced by the high electronegativity and polarizability of bromine. Considering the examples and the simplicity of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around 0.5. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br is approximately 0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 1.36355512.
- A thioester linkage (SC(CCl)), which is not directly present in the examples but can be related to sulfur-containing groups.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is present in several examples with varying effects on the property value.
- An imide group (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O), which is a common feature in cyclic imides and can be related to the example CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O with a property value of 0.20594615.

Considering these features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the imide group suggests a positive contribution to the property value. The chlorinated carbon may also contribute positively, but the overall effect will depend on the balance of these features.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 1.0, considering the positive contributions from the phosphorothioate and imide groups.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A dimethylamide group (CN(C)C(=O)), which is similar to the structure in CN(C)C(=O)C and CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, both of which have negative property values.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring, which is present in several examples with varying property values, but generally contributes to a positive or less negative value.
- A heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen, which can contribute to a more negative property value due to the presence of electronegative atoms.
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C), which is a bulky group that can influence the property value, often seen in molecules with positive or less negative values.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule has a mix of features that contribute to both positive and negative property values. However, the presence of the dimethylamide group and the heterocyclic ring with electronegative atoms suggests a tendency towards a more negative property value.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be around -0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with chlorine substituents on each ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 1.58831695. The example molecule is a biphenyl with two chlorine atoms, while the target molecule is a biphenyl ether with three chlorine atoms.

The presence of the ether linkage in the target molecule might slightly reduce the property value compared to the biphenyl example, as ethers can introduce some polarity and potentially lower the overall hydrophobicity or other related properties. However, the additional chlorine atom could counterbalance this effect by increasing the property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is likely to be slightly lower than 1.58831695 but still relatively high due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around 1.4.

Looking at the examples, we can see that simple linear alkanes and ethers tend to have property values around the range of -0.8 to 0.5. For instance, CCC(O)CC has a property value of -0.80168475, and CCCCCCC=C has a property value of 0.54996518. The presence of the ether group (O) in CCCOCC might slightly lower the property value compared to a simple alkane of similar size due to the polar nature of the ether group.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be around -0.5. This accounts for the ether group and the overall size and structure of the molecule compared to the examples provided.

This structure is somewhat similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 0.68359071. Both molecules contain a tertiary amide and two phenyl rings, although the example has an additional heterocyclic component.

The presence of the tert-butyl group in the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 may slightly increase the hydrophobicity compared to the example, but the overall electronic and steric effects are likely to be similar.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be close to that of the example with a similar structure. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 0.68.

- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents, such as Fc1cccc(Br)c1 (0.17050426) and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (0.44774473), tend to have positive property values.
- Molecules with amide groups, such as CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (0.97752581), also tend to have positive property values, although the presence of additional aromatic rings and substituents can influence the value.

Considering these factors, the presence of both an amide group and a bromobenzene moiety suggests a property value that is likely positive but not extremely high, as the molecule is relatively simple compared to some of the more complex examples with higher values.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around 0.2 to 0.3. Therefore, a specific predicted value could be approximately:

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with alkyl groups attached to benzene rings, such as CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (0.14944438) and CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (0.53328422), tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of additional alkyl groups generally increases the property value, as seen in the difference between CCc1ccc(C)cc1 and CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1.

Given that CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is similar to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1, but with one less methyl group on the benzene ring, we can expect its property value to be slightly lower than 0.53328422 but still positive.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 would be approximately 0.4.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have more negative property values. In contrast, aromatic compounds with alkyl groups or without strong electron-withdrawing groups tend to have less negative or positive property values.

Benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, but not as strongly as nitro groups. Therefore, we can expect the property value to be negative, but not as negative as those with multiple nitro groups.

Based on this reasoning and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) would be around -0.5.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -1.5500698068515157
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with negative property values.
- An aromatic ring with a heteroatom (oxygen), similar to some examples with negative property values.
- A cyclic urea structure (O=C2CN...C(=O)N2), which is not directly comparable to any specific example but suggests a certain degree of polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Based on these observations, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of the nitro group and the overall polar nature of the structure. Comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.5 to -1.0.

Therefore, a specific predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 could be approximately -0.75.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.5381968263382932
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, which is similar to the example N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 with a property value of 1.20625604. The main difference between the two is the presence of a double bond in the example, which is absent in the target molecule.

The removal of the double bond in the target molecule could potentially lead to a slight decrease in the property value due to the change in electronic structure and possibly reduced resonance stabilization. However, the overall aromatic character and the presence of two phenyl rings remain similar.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would likely be slightly lower than 1.20625604. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around 1.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a relatively small and compact structure with two amide groups and a cyclohexane ring. In the examples, similar cyclic structures with amide groups, such as C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1, have negative property values. This suggests that the presence of amide groups and a cyclic structure might contribute to a lower property value.

Considering the examples and the structural features of the given molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -1.0. However, given the specific examples and the nature of the molecule, a more precise prediction would be:

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 2.0353774713846344
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, which is a chlorinated aromatic compound. In the examples, we have several chlorinated aromatic compounds:

1. Clc1ccccc1Cl (1,4-dichlorobenzene) with a property value of 0.44774473.
2. Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (a more complex chlorinated aromatic compound) with a property value of 2.84390428.

The molecule in question, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is similar to 1,4-dichlorobenzene but with an additional chlorine atom, making it 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. The presence of additional chlorine atoms generally increases the property value due to increased molecular weight and potential changes in electronic properties.

Given that 1,4-dichlorobenzene has a property value of 0.44774473, and considering the trend that additional chlorine atoms tend to increase the property value, we can predict that the property value for 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene will be higher than 0.44774473 but significantly lower than the complex chlorinated compound with a value of 2.84390428.

A reasonable estimate for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 0.8 to 1.0, considering the incremental increase due to the additional chlorine atom.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately 0.9.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.32321914665930546
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically a diethylbenzene. 

Looking at the examples, we can see that similar aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions tend to have property values around the range of -0.5 to 0.5. For instance, Cc1ccccc1N has a property value of -0.52121482, and CCc1ccccn1 has a value of -0.47552351. These examples suggest that the presence of an aromatic ring with alkyl groups tends to result in a slightly negative property value.

Given the structure of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, which is a diethylbenzene, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be approximately -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a sulfonamide derivative, which is similar to some of the nitroaromatic compounds in the examples.

The molecule contains an aniline moiety (Nc1ccc(cc1)) similar to the example Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of -0.79504794. The sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is electron-withdrawing, similar to the nitro group, but generally less so than two nitro groups.

Considering the electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonamide group and its similarity to the nitro group, we can expect the property value to be somewhat similar to, but slightly less negative than, the nitroaromatic example.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be around -0.6.

Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, the property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a physicochemical property such as hydrophobicity, solubility, or a similar characteristic. The molecule you provided, c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically triphenylene.

Looking at the examples, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with similar structures, such as c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 (2.13172743) and c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 (2.25883931), have relatively high property values. These values suggest that the property in question increases with the number of aromatic rings and the degree of conjugation.

Given that triphenylene is a highly conjugated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, I would predict its property value to be in a similar range to the examples provided. Therefore, the predicted property value for triphenylene (c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34) is approximately 2.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles a flavonoid structure, which is known for having multiple hydroxyl groups attached to aromatic rings. In the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings, such as Oc1cccc(O)c1, have negative property values, indicating a tendency towards lower values due to the presence of polar functional groups.

Considering the structural similarity to other polycyclic aromatic compounds with hydroxyl groups, and the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for this molecule. Given the complexity and the number of hydroxyl groups, the property value is likely to be moderately negative.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 is approximately -0.85.

True Property: -0.7519429343322958
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)O)
- An amide linkage (NC(C)=O)
- A methyl group (C)

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, have relatively high property values (1.50792269).
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1, have lower property values (-0.02777878).
- The presence of sulfur, as in CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, also contributes to a higher property value (1.27214513).

Considering these factors, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage suggests a property value that is likely positive but not as high as those with multiple halogens or extensive aromatic systems. The sulfur and phosphorothioate group contribute to a higher value, while the amide linkage moderates it.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around 0.8.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.2762825813315571
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, symmetrical molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values, likely due to the electronegativity and polarizability of chlorine. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a very high property value of 3.37655904, which is the highest among the examples, and it contains multiple chlorine atoms.

However, the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is much simpler and smaller than the complex aromatic chlorinated compounds in the examples. The closest comparison might be with simpler chlorinated compounds, but none are directly provided. Given the trend that more chlorine atoms and larger, more complex structures tend to increase the property value, we can infer that Cl\C=C/Cl will have a positive property value, but not as high as the complex aromatic chlorinated compounds.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around 0.5, reflecting the influence of the two chlorine atoms but accounting for the simplicity and small size of the molecule.

True Property: -0.8603212426109452
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and their properties. Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle similar to benzene but with a nitrogen atom replacing one of the carbon atoms in the ring. 

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23, have a property value of 0.30378768. Another example, CNc1ccccc1, which is aniline, has a property value of -0.4178449. Pyridine is less electron-rich than aniline due to the electronegative nitrogen, which might suggest a property value closer to neutral or slightly negative.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of pyridine (c1ccncc1) would be around -0.1 to 0.1. Given the examples and the nature of pyridine, a specific predicted property value could be:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has several key features:
1. A benzene ring with a carbonyl group (C=O) attached, similar to acetophenone derivatives.
2. An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23), which is present in some of the examples.
3. A chlorinated aromatic ring, which tends to increase the property value based on examples like Clc1ccc(I)cc1 and Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl.
4. An ether linkage (OCC(O)COC(=O)), which is present in some examples with varying effects on the property value.

Considering these features:
- The presence of a chlorinated aromatic ring suggests a higher property value.
- The amide linkage and ether group can have varying effects, but they generally do not lead to extremely high or low values.
- The overall structure is complex, with multiple aromatic rings and functional groups, which might suggest a moderate to high property value.

Based on these considerations and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 would be around 0.5. This accounts for the influence of the chlorinated aromatic ring and the overall complexity of the molecule.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.8005900158891894
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the size of the carbon chain, and the presence of heteroatoms.

The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol with a five-carbon chain and a hydroxyl group (OH) at the end. In the examples, linear alkanes and alcohols tend to have property values around zero, with slight variations depending on the specific structure and functional groups.

For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCCI (a linear alkane with an iodine atom) has a property value of 0.72033259, while OC1CCCCCCC1 (a cyclic alcohol) has a property value of -0.16927269. The presence of the hydroxyl group in CCCCCO is likely to have a similar effect as in OC1CCCCCCC1, but the linear structure might result in a slightly different value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be slightly negative, similar to other alcohols, but not as low as the cyclic alcohol example. Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCCCO could be around -0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a sulfonamide with a cyclic structure, which includes a benzene ring and a sulfonyl group. The presence of the sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) and the amide linkage (C(=O)N) are significant features that can influence the property value.

From the examples, molecules with sulfonyl groups and aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, especially when they are part of a larger, more complex structure. For instance, the molecule CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C has a property value of 1.06093059, and it contains a sulfonyl group and aromatic rings.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to other sulfonamide or aromatic-containing structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.8.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:

1. **Aromatic Ring**: The presence of a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) is a common feature in several examples, often contributing to a positive property value.
2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The nitro group is known to contribute to a negative property value, as seen in examples like Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-0.2981635) and CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O (1.23786638).
3. **Ester Groups (C(=O)OC)**: The presence of ester groups can contribute to a range of property values, depending on the context. For instance, CCCCCC(=O)OC (-0.6769539) and COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C have similar ester functionalities.
4. **Heterocyclic Ring**: The presence of a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen (C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1)) is another feature that can influence the property value.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule has both positive and negative contributing factors. The aromatic ring and ester groups might contribute positively, while the nitro group and heterocyclic ring might contribute negatively.

Based on the balance of these features and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be slightly negative, around -0.2 to -0.3. Therefore, a specific predicted property value could be:

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two amide groups and a cyclohexane-like structure due to the cyclization of the peptide bond. This structure is relatively small and lacks large hydrophobic or aromatic groups, which tend to increase the property values in the examples provided.

Looking at the examples, smaller and less complex molecules with polar functional groups, such as amides, tend to have lower property values. For instance, molecules like CCNC(=S)NCC (-1.26489254) and C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O (-3.36718541) have low property values due to their polar nature and lack of extensive hydrophobic or aromatic systems.

Given the structure of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, it is expected to have a relatively low property value due to its small size, cyclic nature, and presence of polar amide groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -1.0.

The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure, consisting of a chloroethane (ethyl chloride) group. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons like CCCCC have a property value of -0.09749943, while aromatic chlorinated compounds like Clc1ccccc1 have a property value of 0.00068421. The presence of chlorine in a simple structure like ClCC might slightly increase the property value compared to a simple hydrocarbon.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for ClCC is likely to be slightly positive but close to zero, similar to other small, chlorinated compounds. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC is approximately:

The molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a pyridine ring and a trichloromethyl group. From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values. For instance:
   - Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2 has a property value of 1.14125643.
   - Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 2.03537747.
   - Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 2.84390428.

2. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms, especially in a trichloromethyl group, tends to increase the property value. For example:
   - ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C4(Cl)C5(Cl)C1(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl has a property value of 2.65745801.
   - Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 1.72611614.

Considering these observations, the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is expected to have a positive property value, likely in the range of the higher values due to the presence of the trichloromethyl group and the aromatic ring.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl would be approximately 2.5.

True Property: -0.5347757938800023
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCC(C)O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCCC(C)O is a primary alcohol with a five-carbon chain and a hydroxyl group attached to the second carbon, making it 2-hexanol.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCCCCCl (1-chloroheptane) with a property value of 0.58609128
- CCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC (a long-chain ester) with a property value of 2.99832969
- CCC(C)CCO (2-pentanol) with a property value of -0.63227522
- CCC(CC)CO (3-pentanol) with a property value of -0.63227522

The most relevant comparison is with 2-pentanol and 3-pentanol, both of which have a property value of -0.63227522. Since 2-hexanol is structurally similar to these alcohols but with an additional carbon, we can expect the property value to be slightly different but in the same range.

Considering the trend that longer carbon chains in alcohols might slightly increase the property value, I would predict the property value for CCCCC(C)O (2-hexanol) to be slightly higher than -0.63227522, but still negative. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.6.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCC(C)O is approximately -0.6.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the given examples and their properties. The molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is 1,4-dibromobenzene, which is an aromatic compound with two bromine atoms attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have positive property values.
- For instance, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl (1,4-dichlorobenzene) has a property value of 1.58831695.
- ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 (a polychlorinated aromatic compound) has a property value of 2.45630131.

Considering the similarity of 1,4-dibromobenzene to 1,4-dichlorobenzene, and the general trend of positive values for halogenated aromatics, we can predict that the property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 will also be positive and likely similar to that of 1,4-dichlorobenzene, but potentially slightly higher due to the larger size and polarizability of bromine compared to chlorine.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately 1.6.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated biphenyl, similar to the example Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 5.16480112. 

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl has a similar structure but with fewer chlorine atoms compared to the example. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in the example. Given that the structure is less chlorinated, we can expect the property value to be somewhat lower than 5.16480112 but still relatively high due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be around 4.5.

- Aromatic rings, similar to many examples.
- Phosphate ester group (OP(=O)(O)O), which is not directly present in the examples but can be related to other polar functional groups.
- Alkyl groups (methyl groups attached to aromatic rings), which are present in several examples.

From the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and polar functional groups (like carbonyls, nitro groups, etc.) tend to have a range of property values, often slightly positive or negative, depending on the specific functional groups and their interactions.

Considering the presence of aromatic rings and the phosphate ester group, which introduces polarity, the property value is likely to be slightly negative or close to zero, as seen in some examples with similar features.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is around -0.1.

To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to be electron-withdrawing and can increase lipophilicity.
- An aromatic ring, which can contribute to stability and potential interactions.
- A piperidine-like ring with two chlorine atoms and a ketone group, which can influence the electronic properties and steric factors.

From the examples, molecules with halogens, especially multiple chlorines, tend to have higher property values, often positive. For instance:
- Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 2.92949851.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 3.82361956.

The presence of the CF3 group and the ketone might moderate the property value compared to those with extensive chlorination. However, the overall structure suggests a positive property value due to the electron-withdrawing groups and the aromatic system.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O would be around 1.5 to 2.0. Given the examples and the structural analysis, a specific prediction could be:

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.503302295263728
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is a nitrobenzene derivative with a methoxy group attached to the benzene ring. The presence of the nitro group (N(=O)=O) is known to have a significant electron-withdrawing effect, which can influence the overall property value. The methoxy group (CO) is an electron-donating group, but its effect is generally weaker compared to the nitro group.

Looking at the examples, we have:
- O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O with a property value of -0.57199663, which is a dinitrobenzene.
- c1ccccc1O with a property value of -0.64780671, which is phenol.
- Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl with a property value of 0.83657928, which is a chlorinated pyridine.

The nitro group tends to lower the property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature, as seen in the dinitrobenzene example. The methoxy group will slightly counteract this effect, but the overall influence of the nitro group is expected to dominate.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is likely to be negative and closer to the value of the dinitrobenzene example, but slightly less negative due to the presence of the methoxy group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is approximately -0.6.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 0.89316315. The given molecule has a similar structure but with even more chlorine atoms, which typically increases the electron-withdrawing effect and could potentially increase the property value.

Considering the trend that more chlorination tends to increase the property value, and given the structural similarity to the example, I would predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is slightly higher than 0.89316315.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 1.0.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -1.2107718076382443
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. Esters generally have moderate to low property values in the examples given, often negative, due to their polar nature and the presence of the carbonyl group.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar functional groups, such as esters and carbonyl-containing compounds, tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 has a property value of -0.6113385, and CNC(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc12 has a property value of -0.15100437.

Considering the structure of CCCOC=O and its similarity to other esters and carbonyl-containing compounds, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be around -0.5. This accounts for the polar nature of the ester group and the relatively simple structure of the molecule compared to more complex examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC=O is approximately -0.5.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.9244998115284798
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is a linear aliphatic ester, specifically decanoate ester. It consists of a long hydrophobic alkyl chain (10 carbon atoms) and an ester functional group. In the examples, similar molecules with long alkyl chains and ester or carbonyl groups tend to have property values around or slightly above zero, indicating a balance between hydrophobic and polar characteristics.

For instance:
- CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 (a long alkyl chain with an aromatic ring) has a property value of 1.00605723.
- CCCCCC(CC)C=O (a long alkyl chain with a carbonyl group) has a property value of 0.04289975.
- CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C (a complex ester) has a property value of 1.17580886.

Given the structure of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, which is a simple ester with a long alkyl chain, it is reasonable to predict a property value slightly above zero, reflecting the balance between the hydrophobic alkyl chain and the polar ester group.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1) similar to the structure in Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which has a property value of 0.14122022.
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, similar to Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of -0.06212595.
- Two chlorine atoms, which are present in several examples with varying effects on the property value.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N) connecting two aromatic rings, which is a common feature in several examples with positive property values.

Considering these features and the examples provided, the molecule has a combination of electron-withdrawing groups (Cl, N(=O)=O) and an amide linkage, which generally contribute to a positive property value. The presence of the nitro group and chlorine atoms suggests a moderate positive value, but not as high as those with multiple aromatic rings or extensive conjugation.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- Two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are similar to the phosphorothioate group in the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 1.36355512.
- Aromatic rings with ether linkages, similar to the example CC(C)(C)C(=O)C(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)n2cncn2 with a property value of 0.53730736.
- Sulfur linkages between aromatic rings, which can influence the property value.

Considering these structural features and the examples provided, the molecule is likely to have a positive property value due to the presence of multiple phosphorothioate groups and aromatic systems. The presence of sulfur linkages and ether groups may moderate the value slightly.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 would be approximately 1.5.

True Property: -0.7106168622361443
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

In the examples, we have a similar molecule: Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which is nitrotoluene, with a property value of -0.2981635. The presence of the nitro group is a common feature, and both molecules have an aromatic ring. However, the presence of the hydroxyl group in 4-nitrophenol can influence the property value due to its electron-donating nature, which can affect the overall electronic distribution in the molecule.

Considering the influence of the hydroxyl group and comparing it to the nitrotoluene example, we can predict that the property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O will be slightly more negative than -0.2981635 due to the additional electron-donating effect of the hydroxyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be approximately -0.35.

True Property: -6.78076001492882
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a sugar-like compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, resembling a polysaccharide or a complex carbohydrate.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, tend to have negative property values. This is likely due to the high polarity and hydrogen bonding potential of hydroxyl groups, which can influence the property being measured.

Given the structure of the molecule OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, which contains numerous hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. The complexity and high degree of hydroxylation suggest a value similar to or more negative than the example with a simple sugar structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -3.5, considering the high number of hydroxyl groups and the structural complexity.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of functional groups and structural features, and their property values range from highly negative to highly positive.

The molecule CCC#C is a simple alkyne with a terminal triple bond. In the examples, molecules with similar small hydrocarbon structures, such as alkanes and alkenes, tend to have property values that are slightly negative or close to zero. For instance, CCC(C)C(=O)C has a property value of -0.49091816, and CCC(C)OC(=O)C has a value of -0.50863911.

Considering the simplicity and small size of CCC#C, along with the presence of a triple bond, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly negative, reflecting the general trend observed in similar small hydrocarbons.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C is approximately -0.45.

1. **Chlorine Substituents**: The molecule contains three chlorine atoms on a benzene ring. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings tend to have higher property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 3.37655904, and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 0.89480525.

2. **Phosphorothioate Group**: The presence of a phosphorothioate group (P=S) is similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 1.36355512. This suggests that the phosphorothioate group contributes positively to the property value.

3. **Ether Linkage**: The molecule has an ether linkage (O-aryl), which is also present in some examples with moderate property values, such as Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 with a property value of 1.61123787.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring and the phosphorothioate group are likely to contribute significantly to a higher property value. Therefore, I predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl to be approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is a pyridine ring with a carbonyl group (C=O) and a hydrazine group (NN) attached. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2, which has a pyrimidine ring with carbonyl and amine groups, and has a property value of -2.12829271. The presence of nitrogen atoms and carbonyl groups in both structures suggests that they might have similar electronic properties, which could influence the property value.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of the electron-withdrawing carbonyl group and the electron-donating hydrazine group, the property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is likely to be negative, similar to the example with a pyrimidine ring.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be approximately -1.8.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Several alkyl chains

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, have a property value of 0.31495393.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1, have a property value of 0.63042786.
- Molecules with piperidine rings, such as CCN2c1cc(N(C)C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23, have a property value of 0.57522608.

Considering these structural features and their contributions to the property values in the examples, the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is likely to have a property value that is a combination of these influences. Given the presence of the phosphorothioate group, amide linkage, and piperidine ring, the property value is expected to be positive and in the range of the examples with similar features.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is approximately 0.5.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.7032274321262372
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (n-octane), we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of functional groups, aromatic rings, and the overall size of the molecule.

In the examples, we see that:
- Simple alkanes like CCCCCC (hexane) have a property value of -0.26677211.
- The addition of an alcohol group, as in CCCCCC(O) (hexanol), results in a more negative property value, -0.26677211 to -0.80168475.
- Larger alkanes or those with more branching tend to have slightly higher property values.

Given that CCCCCCCC is a straight-chain alkane (n-octane), it is similar to hexane but with two additional carbon atoms. Based on the trend that larger alkanes have slightly higher property values, we can predict that the property value for n-octane will be slightly higher than that of hexane.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (n-octane) would be around -0.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbon-carbon triple bond (C#C). It resembles some of the other polycyclic structures in the examples, such as:

- CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO, which has a property value of -0.30330874.
- CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 1.05381484.

The presence of the hydroxyl group and the carbonyl group (C=O) in the structure can influence the property value. The carbon-carbon triple bond (C#C) might also have an impact, but it is less common in the examples provided.

Considering the structural similarities and the presence of functional groups, the property value is likely to be influenced by the balance between the hydrophobic polycyclic structure and the polar functional groups. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C would be around 0.5. This value reflects the influence of the polar groups while considering the overall hydrophobic nature of the polycyclic structure.

True Property: -0.684480174254804
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like the one you've provided involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples given. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by factors such as aromaticity, the presence of halogens, functional groups, and overall molecular complexity.

The molecule you've provided, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, is quite complex and contains multiple aromatic rings, methoxy groups, and a significant number of oxygen atoms, which suggests a high degree of polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Given the examples, molecules with high aromaticity and multiple functional groups, especially those with oxygen, tend to have property values that are positive but not extremely high unless there are additional factors like extensive halogenation or specific structural motifs that significantly increase the value.

Considering these factors, I would predict a property value in the range of 1.5 to 2.5. However, without a precise model or additional context, this is a rough estimate. Based on the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, a reasonable prediction might be around:

True Property: -0.20074618465249824
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of specific functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to the example Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (nitrophenol) with a property value of -0.71061686. The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) and a chlorine atom (Cl) on a benzene ring suggests that the property value might be similar to other halogenated phenols or chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Considering the example Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) with a property value of -0.35120319 and the example Clc1ccccc1I (iodobenzene) with a property value of 0.41435545, we can infer that the presence of a chlorine atom on a benzene ring tends to increase the property value compared to a hydroxyl group alone.

Taking into account the structural similarities and the influence of the chlorine atom, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be slightly less negative than Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, due to the less electron-withdrawing nature of chlorine compared to a nitro group.

Therefore, a predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl could be approximately -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C), which is a relatively small and polarizable group.
- An ester linkage (OC(=O)), which is polar and can contribute to a negative property value.
- An amide linkage (NC(=O)), which is also polar and typically contributes to a negative property value.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1), which is similar to some of the examples with positive property values, especially when multiple chlorines are present.

From the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings tend to have higher property values, often positive. However, the presence of polar groups like esters and amides can contribute negatively.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero, as the polar groups may offset the positive contribution from the chlorinated aromatic ring.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around -0.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- Two chlorophenyl groups, which are present in several examples with positive property values.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2), which is a heterocyclic aromatic ring. Similar heterocyclic structures in the examples tend to have negative property values.
- An alcohol group (OC), which can influence the property value depending on its context in the molecule.

From the examples:
- Molecules with multiple chlorophenyl groups, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, tend to have high positive property values.
- Heterocyclic structures like Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2 and Cn1cnc2n(C)c(=O)[nH]c(=O)c12 have negative property values.
- The presence of an alcohol group in Oc1ccc(O)cc1 is associated with a negative property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule has a mix of features that could lead to both positive and negative influences on the property value. However, the presence of two chlorophenyl groups, which are strongly associated with positive values, might dominate the overall property.

Therefore, I predict the property value for OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl to be moderately positive, around 0.8.

The structure of CCCCCOC=O is similar to CCCCC(=O)OCC, but with a slightly shorter carbon chain on the ester side. This suggests that the property value might be slightly different due to the change in chain length and the position of the ester group. However, given the similarity in structure, the property value is likely to be in the same range.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be approximately -0.65.

To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we can look at the example provided for a similar molecule, ClCCCl, which has a property value of -0.59868068. The molecule ClCCl is a simpler structure, being dichloromethane, compared to ClCCCl, which is 1,2-dichloroethane. Given the trend that smaller, simpler molecules with similar functional groups tend to have slightly more negative property values, we can predict that ClCCl will have a property value slightly more negative than -0.59868068.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be approximately -0.65.

To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a methylphenol, specifically p-cresol, which consists of a benzene ring with a methyl group and a hydroxyl group attached.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O with a property value of 0.33185383, which is a similar structure with a methyl group and a hydroxyl group on a benzene ring.
- Oc1cccc(O)c1 with a property value of -0.8492371, which is a dihydroxybenzene (catechol).

The structure Cc1cccc(C)c1O is more similar to the first example (CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O) than to the second (Oc1cccc(O)c1), as it has a single hydroxyl group and a methyl group on the benzene ring. The presence of the hydroxyl group generally increases the polarity, while the methyl group can slightly decrease it.

Given the similarity to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, we can predict that the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O will be close to 0.33185383. However, since Cc1cccc(C)c1O has one less methyl group, the property value might be slightly lower due to reduced hydrophobicity.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be approximately 0.25.

To predict the property value for the molecule "Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl", we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated biphenyl, which is similar to the examples provided with multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings tend to have higher property values. For instance:

- "Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl" has a property value of 2.92949851.
- "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl" has a property value of 3.37655904.
- "Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl" has a property value of 1.14043538.

The molecule "Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl" is a dichlorinated biphenyl, which is structurally similar to the first two examples but with fewer chlorine atoms. Therefore, we can expect its property value to be somewhat lower than those with more chlorine atoms.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of "Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl" would be around 2.0.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.25076167919270853
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is 2-methyl-1-butene, which is a small, branched alkene. In the examples, alkenes and small hydrocarbons generally have positive property values. For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCC=C (1-decene) has a property value of 1.08378308, and the molecule CCCCCCCC (n-octane) has a property value of 0.70322743. These examples suggest that alkenes and alkanes tend to have positive property values, with alkenes potentially having slightly higher values due to the presence of the double bond.

Given that CC=C(C)C is a small, branched alkene, we can expect its property value to be positive and likely closer to the lower end of the positive range due to its smaller size compared to the longer chain alkenes and alkanes in the examples.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around 0.5.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.6277594560963434
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

In the given examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a very high property value of 4.27068008, likely due to the high number of chlorine atoms and the aromatic structure. Another example, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, also has a high property value of 2.28784967, again due to the high chlorine content and complex structure.

However, ClCCl is a much simpler molecule with only two chlorine atoms and no aromatic or complex cyclic structures. The closest example in terms of simplicity and chlorine content is ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl, which has a property value of 0.49892337. Given that ClCCl is even simpler, we can expect its property value to be lower than this.

Therefore, based on the trend observed in the examples, I would predict the property value for ClCCl to be around 0.3.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.6933748586463581
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values. For instance, Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 has a property value of 1.11874603, and Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of 0.69337486.

2. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms seems to increase the property value, as seen in the example of Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl.

Given that Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is similar to Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl but with an additional chlorine atom, we can expect the property value to be slightly higher than 0.69337486.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl would be approximately 0.75.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -0.684480174254804
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples.

The molecule in question appears to be quite complex, with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and possibly a sugar-like moiety. The presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (methoxy, hydroxyl, and ether) suggests a potential for hydrogen bonding and increased polarity, which could influence the property value.

Given the examples, molecules with extensive aromatic systems and multiple oxygen functionalities tend to have negative property values, often due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. However, the presence of large, complex structures can also lead to positive values if the overall hydrophobic character is significant.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be negative, reflecting the influence of the polar functional groups and the complex structure. A reasonable estimate, based on the examples provided, might be around -1.5. However, this is a rough estimate and should be taken with caution due to the complexity of the molecule.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -1.3461762723373902
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A thioether group (CS-)
- A pyrazole ring (1,2,4-triazole-like structure)
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- A tertiary butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with heterocycles and carbonyl groups tend to have negative property values, such as CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C (-0.89849996) and Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2 (-1.51455949).
- The presence of a thioether group (CS-) in the molecule CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1 (0.63042786) suggests a positive contribution, but this molecule also has an aromatic ether, which might influence the property differently.

Considering these factors, the presence of the pyrazole ring and carbonyl group in CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C suggests a negative property value, but the thioether and tertiary butyl group might mitigate this negativity to some extent.

Based on the structural analysis and comparison with similar molecules, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be around -0.8.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.32547702808177736
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ester group (COOC) attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with ester groups, such as CCCCCC(=O)OC and CCCCC(=O)OCC, have property values of -0.41004495.
- Molecules with aromatic rings, such as o1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 and O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, tend to have positive property values, but this is not always the case, as seen with Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl, which has a negative value.

Considering the structure of ethyl benzoate, it is similar to the structure of CCCCC(=O)OCC, which has a property value of -0.41004495. The presence of the aromatic ring in ethyl benzoate might slightly influence the property value, but given the examples, the ester group seems to have a more significant impact.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.41004495.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.6928959141021991
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of functional groups, halogens, and the overall size and shape of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached. In the examples, we have a similar structure, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which has a property value of 0.86435806. However, this example is an aromatic compound, which typically has different properties compared to aliphatic compounds.

For aliphatic compounds, we can look at examples like CCCCCCCCO, which has a property value of -0.26677211. The presence of a bromine atom, which is more electronegative than oxygen, might increase the property value slightly due to its influence on the electron distribution in the molecule.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be slightly higher than that of CCCCCCCCO due to the presence of bromine. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around -0.1.

SMILES: CO
True Property: -1.8682258254725508
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of organic and inorganic compounds with different functional groups and structural features. The property values range from highly negative to positive, indicating a diverse set of properties being measured.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is a small, non-polar molecule with no additional functional groups or complex structures. In the context of the given examples, simpler molecules with fewer functional groups and lower molecular weights tend to have property values closer to zero, often negative.

Considering the examples provided, particularly those with small, simple structures like CCC (propane, -0.63131733) and CCBr (bromoethane, -0.64164885), we can infer that CO, being a small and simple molecule, would likely have a property value in the negative range, but not as extreme as more complex or highly functionalized molecules.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO, based on the given examples, would be around -0.5.
