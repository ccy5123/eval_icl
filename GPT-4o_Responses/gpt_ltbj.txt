Predicting the specific property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 based on the given examples is a complex task, as it involves understanding the relationship between molecular structure and the property values provided. The examples include a variety of molecular structures with different functional groups and complexities, and the property values seem to be related to some form of energy or stability measurement, possibly related to thermodynamic properties like enthalpy or Gibbs free energy.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a lactam (cyclic amide) structure. The presence of chlorine atoms and the aromatic ring suggests that the property value might be influenced by the electron-withdrawing nature of chlorine and the resonance stabilization of the aromatic system.

Given the examples, particularly those with aromatic rings and chlorine substituents, the property values vary significantly. For instance, Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a high positive value (1674.14310593), while ClC=C has a very negative value (-1017.54765979). The presence of a lactam ring might contribute to a more moderate property value due to its potential for resonance and hydrogen bonding.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 might be in the range of moderate positive values, similar to other aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups. A specific prediction could be around 500, acknowledging the uncertainty and variability in the dataset.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the specific property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C based on the examples provided is a complex task, as it involves understanding the relationship between molecular structure and the given property values. The examples suggest that the property values are likely related to some thermodynamic or electronic property, such as energy or enthalpy, but without explicit information, it's challenging to determine the exact nature of the property.

However, we can make an educated guess by comparing the structure of CCCOC(C)C to similar molecules in the list. The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with a branched alkyl group. Looking at similar structures:

- CCCCCCO (hexanol) has a property value of -729.39117821.
- CCCCCC1CCCC1 (a cyclic alkane) has a property value of -1542.79245395.
- CCC(C)CO (a branched alcohol) has a property value of 207.19331282.

Given that CCCOC(C)C is an ether, it might have a property value closer to that of alcohols or other ethers, which tend to have less negative or even positive values compared to long-chain alkanes or cyclic structures.

Considering these points, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C might be around 200 to 300, similar to CCC(C)CO. Therefore, a specific predicted property value could be approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of halogens, especially bromine, tends to have a significant impact on the property value. For instance, the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of 25.6237901, indicating that the presence of a bromine atom in an aromatic system can lead to a relatively low property value.

Additionally, the presence of carbonyl groups, as seen in several examples, can also influence the property value. For example, the molecule COc2cnc1cncnc1n2, which contains nitrogen and oxygen heteroatoms, has a property value of -92.80009163.

Considering these factors, the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O has a combination of features that suggest a property value that is likely to be negative, given the presence of the bromine atom and the carbonyl groups.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -150.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some form of energy or stability measure.

Biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic compound consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples, similar aromatic compounds with multiple benzene rings tend to have negative property values, indicating a certain level of stability or energy characteristic.

For instance, the molecule Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34, which is a polycyclic aromatic compound, has a property value of -733.13498547. Another example, c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67, which is a highly conjugated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a property value of -1158.65493278.

Given that biphenyl is less complex than these polycyclic aromatic compounds, we can expect its property value to be less negative. However, it should still be negative due to the aromatic nature and stability of the biphenyl structure.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around -500.0. This value reflects its aromatic stability while considering its simpler structure compared to the more complex polycyclic examples.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can look at the examples provided and identify patterns or trends based on the structure and functional groups present in the molecules.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a sulfur atom at the end. This structure is similar to linear alkanes, but with a sulfur atom replacing a terminal hydrogen. In the examples, linear alkanes such as CCCCCCC=C (with a property value of -112.02223439) and CCCCCCC(C)C (with a property value of -13.25798734) have negative property values. The presence of sulfur, which is more electronegative than carbon, might influence the property value, but we can expect it to be in a similar range.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be slightly more negative than the linear alkanes due to the presence of sulfur. Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCCCS could be approximately -150.

True Property: 1236.6021185316952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol, specifically 2-methyl-2-butanol. 

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Simple alkanes and alcohols tend to have positive property values.
- Branched alkanes and alcohols generally have higher property values compared to their linear counterparts.

For instance, the molecule CCC(C)(C)C (2,2-dimethylpropane) has a property value of 847.14078162, and CCC(C)(C)CO (2-methyl-2-butanol) is similar in structure but with an alcohol group, which might increase the property value due to the presence of the hydroxyl group.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO should be higher than that of a simple alkane but possibly lower than the highly branched alkanes with similar carbon counts. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO would be around 900.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is 9H-fluorene, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.

From the examples, we can observe that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons tend to have property values that are relatively high compared to simpler aromatic compounds. For instance, the molecule Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (1,2-diphenylethane) has a property value of 425.12442398, and Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1 (1,2,3-trimethylbenzene) has a property value of 853.20088219.

Given that 9H-fluorene is a larger and more complex aromatic system than benzene or simple alkylbenzenes, we can expect its property value to be higher than those of simpler aromatic compounds. However, it is likely to be lower than the highly substituted or functionalized aromatic compounds with very high property values.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (9H-fluorene) would be around 500. This is an estimate based on the trend observed in the examples provided.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is a derivative of a cyclic urea, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of 431.03241148.

The main difference between the two molecules is the substitution of a methyl group (C) with a more complex alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the new molecule. This substitution introduces additional carbon atoms and increases the molecular complexity, which could affect the property value.

Given the trend in the examples, where increased molecular complexity and size often lead to higher property values, we can predict that the property value for the new molecule will be slightly higher than 431.03241148.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be approximately 450.0.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of halogens, especially fluorine, tends to increase the property value. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of 588.56456125, and the presence of multiple chlorine atoms in Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl results in a property value of -11.92131116. The presence of a trifluoromethyl group, which is highly electronegative, is likely to have a significant impact on the property value.

Considering the examples and the structural features of trifluoromethylbenzene, I would predict a property value that reflects the influence of the trifluoromethyl group. Given the trend observed with halogenated aromatic compounds, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around 500.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have high property values. The example OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO has a property value of 2399.48870132. This suggests that the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups significantly increases the property value.

Given that OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is similar in structure to OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, with a similar number of hydroxyl groups and overall molecular structure, we can predict that the property value will also be high.

3. **Complexity and Size**: The complexity and size of the molecule are similar to those of the larger cyclic structures in the examples, which tend to have more negative property values.

Considering these factors, the molecule's property value is likely to be negative and similar in magnitude to the larger cyclic structures with multiple functional groups. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -2000.0. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C is approximately:

This structure is somewhat similar to the example O=N(=O)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of 491.62121189. The presence of the acetamide group (CC(=O)N-) in the target molecule could influence the property value, potentially lowering it due to the additional polar group compared to the nitrobenzene example.

Considering the examples and the structural features, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O would be slightly lower than 491.62121189, due to the additional acetamide group. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 450.0.

Predicting the property value for the given molecule, CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, based on the examples provided, involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
- Two ethoxy groups (OCC)
- A thioether linkage (SC)
- A chloro-substituted aromatic ring
- A fused heterocyclic system with a lactam (n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12)

The presence of a phosphorothioate group and a chloro-substituted aromatic ring suggests a potential for a relatively high property value, as seen in some examples with halogenated aromatics and sulfur-containing groups. However, the presence of a heterocyclic system and the specific arrangement of functional groups can also influence the property value.

Considering the examples, particularly those with halogenated aromatics and sulfur-containing groups, the property value might be expected to be in a similar range to those with complex aromatic and heterocyclic systems.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be approximately -800.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CC(C)(C)CO is a simple alcohol, specifically tert-butanol, which is a branched alcohol with a tertiary carbon.

From the examples, we can observe that simple alcohols and hydrocarbons tend to have property values that are relatively low compared to more complex or highly substituted molecules. For instance, the property value for CCC (propane) is -2071.55558583, and for CC(C)CO (isobutanol), it is -348.37922119. The property value for CCCCCCC(C)O (octanol) is 45.37865432, and for CCCCCCCC(C)O (nonanol), it is 95.74637387.

Given that tert-butanol is a small, branched alcohol, we can expect its property value to be closer to that of isobutanol, but slightly higher due to the increased branching and steric hindrance. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO would be around -300.

Thus, the predicted property value for CC(C)(C)CO is approximately -300.

2. An aromatic ring (phenyl group) with an amine substituent, similar to some of the examples.
3. A guanidine group (NC(=N)N), which is not directly present in the examples but can be considered in terms of its electron-donating and resonance effects.

The examples show a range of property values, with some patterns based on functional groups and molecular complexity. Molecules with sulfonamide groups and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values, often due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonamide and the resonance stabilization in the aromatic system.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is likely to be negative and in a similar range to other sulfonamide-containing aromatic compounds. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately -800.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1934.9168642735879
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O) and a trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), both of which are electron-withdrawing groups. These groups can significantly influence the electronic properties of the molecule.

In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have relatively high property values (659.73820092). The presence of multiple nitro groups, as in Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O, results in a lower property value (-929.91419267), likely due to increased electron-withdrawing effects.

The trifluoromethyl group is also a strong electron-withdrawing group, which can further lower the property value. Considering the combined effects of these groups and the structural complexity of the molecule, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is lower than those of simpler molecules with similar functional groups.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately -800.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 173.5949792702675
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including functional groups, chain length, and presence of specific atoms or groups.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, an ester. In the examples, esters and similar functional groups tend to have property values that are not extremely high or low, often falling within a moderate range. For instance, the molecule CC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of 173.32492393, which is a similar ester structure with a slightly longer carbon chain.

Considering the structure of CC(C)OC=O and comparing it to similar molecules in the examples, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be around 173.32492393, given the similarity in functional groups and chain length. However, since CC(C)OC=O has a shorter chain than CC(C)CCOC=O, the property value might be slightly lower.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O could be approximately 150.0.

True Property: 841.7813122608621
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to the structure of c1ccccc1O (phenol) with an additional methyl group.

The property value for phenol (c1ccccc1O) is given as 567.67417333. The addition of a methyl group (as in toluene, Cc1ccccc1, which is similar to Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1) generally increases the property value due to increased molecular weight and potential changes in electronic distribution.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be slightly higher than that of phenol. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be approximately 600.

To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the given examples and look for patterns or similarities. The molecule in question is a phosphorothioate ester with a substituted aromatic ring.

From the examples, we notice that several molecules with the structure COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl and similar structures have a property value of 648.08161524. These molecules have a phosphorothioate group and a substituted aromatic ring, similar to the molecule we are predicting for.

Given the structural similarity, particularly the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the aromatic ring, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 will be close to 648.08161524.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is 648.08161524.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples provided. Notably, the example Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 58.89441397, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 271.41661465. These examples suggest that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings tends to result in positive property values.

Given that the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is similar in structure to these examples, with multiple chlorine atoms on two aromatic rings, we can predict that its property value will also be positive and likely within a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately 150.0.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 206.123426997196
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group attached to the terminal carbon. 

Looking at the examples, we can see that molecules with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, have relatively high property values. However, the complexity and size of the molecule also play a significant role. For instance, CCC, a simple aliphatic chain, has a very low property value of -2071.55558583, while more complex structures with nitro groups have higher values.

Given that CCCN(=O)=O is a small molecule with a single nitro group, its property value is likely to be higher than that of CCC but significantly lower than the complex aromatic nitro compounds. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around -1500.0.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent. 

Looking at the examples, we have:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 with a property value of 588.56456125
- COc1ccccc1Cl with a property value of 539.27351007
- c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12 with a property value of 201.64530593

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but with a fluorine atom instead of a chlorine atom. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which could affect the property value. However, the presence of both halogens (F and Br) in the aromatic ring suggests that the property value might be in a similar range to the examples with halogenated aromatic rings.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be slightly lower than Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 due to the presence of fluorine, but still in the same range. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 550.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with alcohol groups, such as CCCCC(C)(C)O (820.52972708) and CC(C)(C)CO (847.14078162), tend to have positive property values.
2. Bicyclic structures, such as CC1CCCO1 (-1023.99242838), tend to have negative property values, but this example is a simple ether without additional functional groups.
3. The presence of additional functional groups, such as carbonyls or halogens, tends to decrease the property value, as seen in more complex structures.

Given that CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol, it is likely to have a property value that is positive but not as high as simple alcohols due to the complexity of the bicyclic structure.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 would be around 500.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)
- An amide linkage (N2C(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)

Comparing this structure to the examples:
- The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O has a similar phosphorothioate group and an amide linkage, with a property value of -863.33847375.
- The presence of a phenyl ring is common in many examples, such as COc1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 301.73211804.

The molecule in question lacks the additional sulfur-containing group (SC(CCl)) present in the example with a similar phosphorothioate group, which might slightly increase the property value compared to -863.33847375.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is likely to be slightly less negative than -863.33847375, but still in the negative range due to the presence of the phosphorothioate and amide groups.

A reasonable prediction for the property value could be around -800.0.

Looking at the examples, we can see that molecules with aromatic rings and heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and oxygen) tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O has a property value of -560.19365739, and it contains a similar aromatic and heterocyclic structure. 

Given the structural similarities and the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C will also be negative. Considering the complexity and the presence of aromatic and heterocyclic features, a predicted property value could be around -500.0. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is approximately -500.0.

The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including functional groups, chain length, and presence of specific atoms or groups.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is an ester with a long alkyl chain. In the examples, esters and similar compounds with long alkyl chains tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of 435.17176855, and the molecule CC(C)OC(=O)C has a property value of 766.38800642.

Considering the structure of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, which is similar to these examples but with a slightly longer chain than CCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can predict that its property value will also be positive and likely in a similar range.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 500.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is methyl benzoate, which is an ester derived from benzoic acid and methanol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Esters like CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 have a property value of 58.78292441.
2. The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, which is ethyl benzoate, has a property value of -56.66275603.

Methyl benzoate is structurally similar to ethyl benzoate, differing only by one carbon in the alkyl chain of the ester group. Given this similarity, we can expect the property value of methyl benzoate to be close to that of ethyl benzoate.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate) is approximately -56.66275603.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we need to consider the patterns and trends from the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some calculated property like energy, stability, or reactivity.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear conjugated diene, specifically 1,3-butadiene. In the examples, simpler hydrocarbons or those with fewer functional groups tend to have property values that are less extreme (closer to zero) compared to more complex or highly substituted molecules.

For instance, the molecule CC/C=C/C (a linear alkene) has a property value of -190.84541381, and CCC(C)(C)CC (a branched alkane) has a property value of 1211.99337845. The property values for hydrocarbons seem to vary widely, but simpler structures tend to have values that are not as extreme as those with more complex functional groups.

Given that C=CCC=C is a relatively simple conjugated diene, I would predict its property value to be closer to zero, but slightly negative due to the presence of double bonds, which might contribute to a lower stability compared to saturated hydrocarbons.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C could be around -150.0.

The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups and the overall complexity of the molecule.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is tribromomethane, also known as bromoform. It is a simple molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly bromine, tend to have positive property values. For instance, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of 201.64530593, and Ic1cccc2ccccc12 has a property value of 361.8079441.

Given the simplicity of BrC(Br)Br compared to the more complex aromatic structures in the examples, we can expect its property value to be positive but not as high as those of the larger aromatic compounds. Considering the influence of the bromine atoms and the simplicity of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around 150.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S) with ethoxy groups (OCC).
- A thioester linkage (SC).
- A chloro-substituted carbon (CCl).
- An imide group (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O), which is a cyclic structure with a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with halogen substitutions (Cl, Br, F) tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of aromatic rings (benzene) also influences the property value, often increasing it.
- The presence of sulfur (S) and phosphorus (P) can significantly affect the property value, as seen in the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 226.67713353.

Considering these factors, the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has multiple features that could increase its property value, such as the presence of halogens, aromatic rings, and a phosphorothioate group.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 200 to 300. Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, a specific prediction could be approximately 250.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A dimethylamide group (CN(C)C(=O)), similar to CN(C)C(=O)C, which has a property value of 1016.49641224.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of 533.33664893.
- A heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen, similar to Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2, which has a property value of -853.0719764.
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C), which is a common feature in several molecules but not directly comparable to any specific example.

Considering these structural components and their influence on the property values in the examples, the molecule is likely to have a property value influenced by the electron-withdrawing effects of the chlorine and the heterocyclic ring, as well as the electron-donating effects of the dimethylamide group.

Balancing these effects and considering the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be around 500.0.

Let's consider the example molecules with similar features:
1. Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of 853.20088219.
2. Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 has a property value of -185.33555694.
3. Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 1392.78251585.

The target molecule, Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, has two chlorinated phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage. This structure is more complex than the first example but less complex than the third example, which has multiple chlorines on a single ring. The second example has a biphenyl structure with two chlorines, similar to the target molecule, but without the ether linkage.

Considering these comparisons, the property value for the target molecule is likely to be between the values of the first and third examples, but closer to the first due to the presence of the ether linkage, which might lower the property value compared to a fully chlorinated ring.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is approximately 1000.0.

In the examples, we have the molecule CC/C=C/C, which is also a linear alkene (2-butene, but with a different stereochemistry), with a property value of -190.84541381. Given the structural similarity and the fact that stereochemistry might not significantly affect the property in this context, we can predict that the property value for CC/C=C\C will be very close to that of CC/C=C/C.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C is approximately -190.84541381.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCOCC is a simple linear ether, specifically diethyl ether.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Simple alkanes and ethers tend to have property values that are relatively low and negative.
- The presence of oxygen in ethers seems to influence the property value, as seen in examples like CCC(O)CC (59.62313807) and CC(C)O (-758.4780452).

Given that CCCOCC is a simple ether, we can expect its property value to be in a similar range to other small ethers or alcohols. Considering the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be slightly negative, reflecting its simple structure and the presence of an ether linkage.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCOCC could be approximately -700.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a tertiary amide with two phenyl groups and a tert-butyl group attached to the nitrogen. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of -2033.47629285. Both molecules contain a tertiary amide and two phenyl rings, but the example molecule has an additional heterocyclic ring and a sulfur atom, which could contribute to a more negative property value.

Another example, CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23, has a property value of -2026.69265653. This molecule also contains a tertiary amide, but with a more complex aliphatic ring system instead of phenyl rings.

Considering these comparisons, the given molecule is likely to have a property value in a similar range, but slightly less negative due to the absence of additional heteroatoms or complex ring systems.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be approximately -2000.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-)
- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1)

From the examples, we can identify some relevant patterns:
- Molecules with bromobenzene moieties, such as Fc1cccc(Br)c1 and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1, have property values of 674.49075948 and 588.56456125, respectively.
- Molecules with acetamide groups, such as CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, have a property value of -514.56360868.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 combines these two features. The presence of the bromine atom and the acetamide group suggests that the property value might be influenced by both the electron-withdrawing nature of the bromine and the acetamide group.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to be intermediate between the values for similar structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately:

True Property: -257.6184541782862
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is isobutylbenzene, which consists of an isobutyl group (CC(C)C) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1).

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings, such as benzene derivatives, tend to have higher property values. For instance, Cc1ccccc1N has a property value of 783.21946199, and C=Cc1ccccc1 has a property value of 509.85440825. Additionally, the presence of alkyl groups like isopropyl (CC(C)) in CC(C)CO, which has a property value of -348.37922119, suggests that the alkyl group contributes to the property value.

Considering the structure of isobutylbenzene and the trends observed in the examples, we can estimate that the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 will be higher than that of simple alkyl chains but lower than that of more complex aromatic systems with additional functional groups.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 would be around 400.0.

1. Molecules with benzene rings and carbonyl groups (like aldehydes and ketones) tend to have positive property values. For instance, NC(=O)c1ccccc1O has a property value of 817.58608825, and O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of 1034.53521945.

2. The presence of additional functional groups, such as nitro groups, tends to increase the property value significantly, as seen in molecules like Cc1cc(cc(N(=O)=O)c1O)N(=O)=O with a value of 1339.47982876.

3. Simple aromatic compounds without additional electron-withdrawing or donating groups, like COc1ccccc1, have lower property values (207.69868069).

Given that benzaldehyde has a single carbonyl group attached to a benzene ring, it is likely to have a property value that is positive but not as high as those with additional electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) would be around 500. This is a rough estimate, considering the influence of the carbonyl group and the aromatic ring, without additional strong electron-withdrawing groups.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -1240.3394459862827
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them with the examples provided. The molecule contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, a feature seen in some of the examples. It also has a cyclic amide structure, which is similar to some of the other molecules listed.

Given the complexity of the molecule and the presence of electron-withdrawing groups like the nitro group, the property value is likely to be negative, as seen in many of the examples with similar functional groups. The presence of the cyclic structure and the nitro group suggests a significant impact on the property value.

Considering these factors and the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be approximately -1200.0.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -1454.7736866992345
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, where two phenyl rings are connected by a hydrazine (N-N) linkage.

Looking at the examples, we have a similar structure: N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -1071.06451877. The difference between the two structures is that the example has a double-bonded nitrogen (azo group), while the target molecule has a single-bonded nitrogen (hydrazine group).

The presence of the azo group in the example likely contributes to a more negative property value due to its electronic properties and potential resonance stabilization. The hydrazine linkage in the target molecule is less electron-withdrawing compared to the azo group, which might result in a less negative property value.

Considering these structural differences and their potential impact on the property value, the predicted property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would likely be less negative than -1071.06451877. A reasonable estimate could be around -900, accounting for the reduced electron-withdrawing effect of the hydrazine linkage compared to the azo group.

Therefore, the predicted property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is approximately -900.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends based on the molecular structure and the given property values. For instance, cyclic structures with amide groups, such as diketopiperazines, tend to have negative property values. 

One example that is somewhat similar in terms of having a cyclic structure with amide groups is O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, which has a property value of 614.37413968. However, this molecule has additional alkyl groups that may influence the property value.

Considering the structure of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, which is a simpler diketopiperazine without additional substituents, it is likely to have a property value that is less positive than the example with additional alkyl groups.

Based on these observations, I would predict the property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 to be around -700.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated biphenyl, specifically 2,2',4-trichlorobiphenyl.

From the examples, we can observe that chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have negative property values. For instance, Clc1ccccc1Cl has a property value of 783.21946199, and Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a property value of -472.73448332. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally leads to a more negative property value.

Given that Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a trichlorinated biphenyl, we can expect its property value to be more negative than that of Clc1ccccc1Cl but possibly less negative than the more heavily chlorinated example.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be approximately -500.0.

True Property: 141.48457671525685
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically diethylbenzene.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:

1. Simple hydrocarbons, especially those with aromatic rings, tend to have property values that are positive and relatively moderate in magnitude. For instance, Cc1ccccc1N has a property value of 783.21946199, and Cc1ccccc1 (benzene) would likely have a similar positive value.

2. The presence of additional alkyl groups, such as ethyl groups, tends to increase the property value compared to the unsubstituted aromatic ring.

3. The molecule CCc1ccccn1, which is an alkyl-substituted pyridine, has a property value of 207.69868069. This suggests that the presence of an alkyl chain on an aromatic ring contributes positively to the property value.

Given these observations, the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, being a diethylbenzene, is expected to have a positive property value, likely higher than that of a simple benzene but not as high as more complex or functionalized aromatic compounds.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be around 300.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a sulfonamide derivative, which is similar in some respects to nitrobenzene derivatives in the examples.

Looking at the examples, the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of 533.33664893. This molecule is a nitrobenzene, which shares a similar aromatic ring structure with the sulfonamide group in the target molecule. The sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is somewhat similar in electron-withdrawing nature to the nitro group (N(=O)=O), although the sulfonamide is generally less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group.

Given this comparison, the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is likely to be somewhat lower than that of the nitrobenzene derivative due to the slightly less electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonamide group compared to the nitro group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be slightly lower than 533.33664893. A predicted value could be around 500.0, considering the structural similarities and differences.

To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically triphenylene, which consists of three fused benzene rings forming a planar structure.

Looking at the examples, we notice that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54, which is a larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a property value of -1144.7624972. Another example, c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12, also a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a property value of -699.63878044.

Given the structure of triphenylene and its similarity to these examples, we can infer that its property value will also be negative, likely falling between the values of the smaller and larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons provided.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 (triphenylene) would be approximately -800.

Predicting the property value for the given molecule, Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. The molecule appears to be a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group, similar to some of the examples.

The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group suggests that the molecule might have a relatively high property value, as seen in some of the examples with similar functional groups. However, the exact prediction would require a more detailed analysis or a model trained on such data.

Based on the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule could be around -1000.0. This is a rough estimate, considering the complexity and the functional groups present in the molecule.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)OC), an amide group (NC(C)=O), and a thiol group (SC).

From the examples, we can observe that molecules containing phosphorus and sulfur, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl and CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, have relatively high property values (648.08161524 and -421.95294272, respectively). The presence of the phosphorothioate group in the molecule suggests that it might have a significant impact on the property value.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of functional groups similar to those in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around 500. This is a rough estimate based on the observed trends in the provided data.

Looking at the examples, we can see that the property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the types of atoms involved. For instance, molecules with halogens (like Cl) and double bonds tend to have specific property values.

Given the simplicity of Cl\C=C/Cl compared to the more complex structures in the examples, and considering the presence of two chlorine atoms, we can estimate that the property value will be relatively small in magnitude compared to larger, more complex molecules.

Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around 100.0. This is a rough estimate, considering the presence of chlorine atoms and the small size of the molecule.

To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of organic compounds with different functional groups and structural features. The property values seem to be influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular complexity.

Pyridine is an aromatic heterocyclic compound similar to benzene but with one nitrogen atom replacing one CH group. In the examples, aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23, have a property value of -213.8398114. Another example, CNc1ccccc1, which is aniline, has a property value of 207.69868069.

Considering pyridine's structure and comparing it to similar aromatic compounds in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that pyridine's property value will be closer to those of aromatic compounds with nitrogen.

Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule contains several functional groups and structural motifs that can influence its property value, such as:

1. An ester group (OC(=O)).
2. An aromatic ring system with a chlorine substituent.
3. A secondary amine linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23).
4. Multiple aromatic rings.

Given the complexity and the presence of both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, the property value is likely to be influenced by these factors. The examples show a range of property values for molecules with similar features, such as aromatic rings, ester groups, and halogen substituents.

Considering these aspects and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around -500.0. This value reflects the balance of the structural features and their potential influence on the property in question.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -729.391178214291
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we need to consider the patterns and trends from the given examples. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, ring structures, and the overall size of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCO is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a terminal hydroxyl group, making it a primary alcohol (1-pentanol). In the examples, linear alkanes and simple alcohols tend to have positive property values, and the presence of an alcohol group often increases the property value compared to a similar alkane.

For instance, the molecule CCCCCC (hexane) would likely have a property value similar to other linear alkanes, which are generally positive. The addition of an alcohol group (as in CCCCCO) would likely increase this value due to the presence of the polar hydroxyl group.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO (1-pentanol) would be a positive value, likely in the range of other simple alcohols or slightly higher than similar alkanes. Based on the trends observed, a predicted property value for CCCCCO could be approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a sulfonamide with a cyclic structure, containing a benzene ring, a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), and an amide linkage (C(=O)N). The presence of these functional groups can influence the property value significantly.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with sulfonyl groups and aromatic rings tend to have property values that are relatively high, often in the positive range. For instance, the molecule with a sulfonyl group and aromatic rings, CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C, has a property value of 621.02855717.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of the sulfonyl and amide groups, I would predict that the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is likely to be in the positive range, similar to other molecules with sulfonyl and aromatic features.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 600.

The molecule contains an ester group, a nitro group, and an aromatic ring, which are common features in the examples. 

The presence of multiple functional groups, including the nitro group, which is known to significantly influence molecular properties, suggests that the property value might be relatively high. Additionally, the molecule's complexity, with multiple rings and functional groups, aligns it with examples that have higher property values.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 1500.0.

Predicting the property value for the given molecule, O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. This molecule is a bicyclic compound with two amide groups and a ketone group. 

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple rings and carbonyl groups tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of -713.80491196, and it contains carbonyl groups and a ring structure. Similarly, other complex cyclic structures with carbonyl groups also have negative values.

Given the structure of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, which is a bicyclic compound with three carbonyl groups, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Considering the complexity and the presence of multiple carbonyl groups, the property value is likely to be significantly negative.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure, consisting of a chloroethane (ethyl chloride) group. In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules tend to have property values closer to zero, with the sign and magnitude influenced by the presence of halogens and other functional groups.

For instance, the molecule Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) has a property value of 567.67417333, while Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (hexachlorobenzene) has a property value of 1177.24392867. These values suggest that the presence of chlorine atoms contributes positively to the property value.

Given that ClCC is a small molecule with a single chlorine atom, we can expect its property value to be positive but relatively small compared to larger chlorinated compounds. Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be around 500, considering the trend observed in the examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCC is approximately 500.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a pyridine ring and a trichloromethyl group. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms and an aromatic ring suggests that the property value might be influenced by the electron-withdrawing nature of the chlorine atoms and the aromatic system.

Looking at the examples, we have:
- Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of -344.62371263.
- Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -354.97203981.
- ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O, which has a property value of -1068.96569356.

The molecule in question is somewhat similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, but with a pyridine ring instead of a benzene ring and an additional chlorine atom in the trichloromethyl group. The presence of the pyridine nitrogen might slightly alter the property, but the overall electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine atoms is likely to dominate.

Given these considerations, the property value for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is likely to be in the same range as the other chlorinated aromatic compounds, but slightly more negative due to the additional chlorine atom.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl would be approximately -400.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCC(C)O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCC(C)O is a simple alcohol with a linear alkyl chain and a hydroxyl group, similar to the example molecule CCCC(O)CCC, which has a property value of 374.07101493.

Given the structural similarity, we can expect the property value for CCCCC(C)O to be in a similar range. Since CCCCC(C)O has a slightly longer alkyl chain than CCCC(O)CCC, it might have a slightly higher property value due to increased molecular size and potential interactions.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCC(C)O would be slightly higher than 374.07101493. A predicted value could be around 400.0.

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 588.5645612506096
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is 1,4-dibromobenzene, which is a benzene ring with two bromine atoms attached at the para positions.

From the examples, we can observe that halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have negative property values. For instance, ClCCl (dichloromethane) has a property value of -2071.55558583, and ClC(Cl)Cl (chloroform) has a property value of -758.4780452. These values are quite negative, likely due to the presence of electronegative halogen atoms.

Considering the structure of 1,4-dibromobenzene, which is similar to these halogenated compounds but with bromine instead of chlorine, we can expect a negative property value. Bromine is less electronegative than chlorine, so the magnitude of the negative value might be less extreme compared to the chlorinated examples.

Based on this reasoning, I would predict the property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 to be around -500. This is a rough estimate, taking into account the trends observed in the examples provided.

The given molecule, Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl, is a less chlorinated version of the example molecule. The example has a higher degree of chlorination, which likely contributes to its higher property value.

Given that the provided molecule has fewer chlorine atoms, we can expect its property value to be lower than 578.03126562. However, without a precise model or additional data, it's challenging to determine the exact value. A reasonable estimate, considering the reduction in chlorine atoms, might be around 400 to 500. 

Therefore, a predicted property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl could be approximately 450.

The molecule in question is a triaryl phosphate ester, which includes aromatic rings and a phosphate group. In the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and functional groups like phosphates or esters tend to have property values that are negative, indicating a certain level of stability or energy associated with these structures.

Considering the complexity and the presence of multiple aromatic rings and a phosphate group, the property value is likely to be negative and relatively large in magnitude, similar to other complex aromatic structures with functional groups.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1 would be approximately -1200.0.

The molecule contains a trifluoromethyl group (CF3), an aromatic ring, and a piperidine-like structure with two chlorine atoms and a carbonyl group.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with halogens, especially multiple chlorines, tend to have negative property values. The presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring also influences the property value, often leading to a more negative value. The trifluoromethyl group is electronegative and can further contribute to a negative property value.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O would be around -600.

- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (NO2) can influence the property value significantly.
- Methoxy groups (OCH3) are electron-donating and can also affect the property value.

Comparing with similar structures:
- c1ccccc1O (phenol) has a property value of 567.67417333.
- O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (dinitrobenzene) has a property value of 538.56227499.

Considering the influence of both the methoxy and nitro groups, the property value for methoxy nitrobenzene is likely to be between these two values, but closer to the phenol value due to the presence of the methoxy group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is approximately 550.

True Property: -871.3974753367544
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 71.15593782. The given molecule has more chlorine atoms and a more complex structure, which suggests that its property value might be higher due to increased molecular weight and potential changes in electronic properties.

Considering the trend that more chlorination and complex structures tend to increase the property value, I would predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is likely to be higher than 71.15593782. However, without a precise model or additional context, it's challenging to provide an exact value. Based on the examples, a reasonable estimate might be around 150 to 250, considering the increased chlorination and structural complexity. 

Therefore, a predicted property value could be approximately 200.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -445.5776058356753
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is a simple ester, specifically propyl formate.

Looking at the examples, we can see that simple aliphatic compounds and esters tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCC#C has a property value of -550.70690213, and CCCCC#C has a property value of -340.17001017. These are both aliphatic compounds with triple bonds, which are generally more negative than esters.

Given that CCCOC=O is an ester and considering the trend of similar simple aliphatic compounds, we can predict that the property value for CCCOC=O will also be negative, but likely less negative than those with triple bonds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be around -200.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a simple ester, specifically decanoate ester, with a long alkyl chain. 

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with long alkyl chains, such as CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 (-1074.00249682) and CCCCCC(CC)C=O (898.31449369), tend to have property values that are relatively large in magnitude, either positive or negative.
2. Esters, such as CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C (-1431.36280599) and CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C (-1431.36280599), also show significant property values.

Given the structure of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, which is a decanoate ester, we can expect the property value to be influenced by the long alkyl chain and the ester functional group. The property value is likely to be negative, as seen in other long-chain molecules and esters.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around -1000. This is an estimation based on the trends observed in the provided examples.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring.
- Two chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N) connecting two aromatic rings.

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have a property value of 659.73820092.
- Molecules with chlorine atoms on aromatic rings, such as COc1ccc(Cl)cc1, have a property value of 301.73211804.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, have a property value of 491.62121189.

The molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O combines these features, suggesting a property value influenced by the presence of electron-withdrawing groups (Cl and NO2) and the amide linkage.

Considering these factors and the range of property values for similar structures, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 600.0. This value accounts for the electron-withdrawing effects and the structural complexity of the molecule.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them with the examples provided. The molecule contains two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are similar to the phosphorothioate group in the example molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 226.67713353. 

The given molecule also has two aromatic rings connected by a thioether linkage (Sc2ccc), which is a feature that can be compared to other aromatic systems in the examples. The presence of multiple aromatic rings and the phosphorothioate groups suggests that the property value might be influenced by these features.

Considering the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the property value is likely to be higher than the example with a single phosphorothioate group. However, it is not expected to be as high as the most complex examples with multiple halogens or large polycyclic systems.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule could be around 500 to 700. Given the examples and the structural complexity, a specific predicted value could be approximately:

True Property: 659.7382009197082
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which has a nitro group (N(=O)=O) and a hydroxyl group (O) attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can identify a similar structure: Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which is nitrotoluene. This molecule has a property value of 817.58608825. The main difference between nitrotoluene and 4-nitrophenol is the presence of a methyl group (CH3) in nitrotoluene, which is replaced by a hydroxyl group (OH) in 4-nitrophenol.

Considering the structural similarity and the effect of substituents on the benzene ring, the property value for 4-nitrophenol is likely to be close to that of nitrotoluene. The hydroxyl group is more electronegative and can have a different impact compared to the methyl group, but given the examples, we can predict that the property value will be in a similar range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is approximately 817.58608825.

Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, based on the examples provided, involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples.

The given molecule is a complex carbohydrate structure, likely a polysaccharide or a similar sugar derivative, characterized by multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages. In the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and complex ring structures, such as sugars, tend to have negative property values, often due to their high polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Considering the complexity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, the property value is likely to be significantly negative. Based on the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately -1500.0.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -550.7069021279681
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne, with a terminal triple bond.

Looking at the examples, we can see that linear alkanes and alkenes tend to have positive property values, while more complex or aromatic structures often have negative values. For instance, simple linear molecules like CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO (a long-chain alcohol) have a positive value of 200.43105915, and CCCCCC=O (a linear aldehyde) has a negative value of -311.80370893.

Given that CCC#C is a relatively simple linear molecule with a triple bond, it is likely to have a property value that is not as high as long-chain alkanes or alcohols but not as negative as more complex or aromatic structures. The presence of the triple bond might slightly lower the value compared to a similar alkane.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be slightly positive, reflecting its linear structure and the presence of the triple bond. A value around 100 could be a reasonable estimate, given the trends observed in the examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCC#C is approximately:

From the examples, molecules with chlorinated aromatic rings and similar functional groups tend to have negative property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 has a property value of -983.05109845, and Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has a property value of -780.4365964. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms and the phosphorothioate group suggests a significant negative contribution.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl would be around -800.

For instance, the molecule Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2 has a property value of 573.07596227, and it contains a nitrogen-rich heterocycle with carbonyl and amine functionalities.

Considering these observations, the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is likely to have a positive property value due to its structural similarity to other nitrogen-containing heterocycles with carbonyl and amine groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be approximately 500.

The property values seem to be influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, molecular size, and complexity.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)(O))
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Several alkyl chains

From the examples, molecules with sulfur-containing groups (e.g., thiophosphates) and amide linkages tend to have higher property values. Additionally, the presence of a cyclic amine (piperidine) might contribute to a higher value, as seen in some examples with nitrogen-containing rings.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is likely to be positive and relatively high, similar to other complex molecules with sulfur and nitrogen functionalities.

A reasonable prediction for the property value could be around 1200.0, given the structural complexity and functional groups present.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (octane), we can look at the trends in the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the size and complexity of the molecule.

In the examples, linear alkanes like CCCCCCCO (heptanol) have a property value of -366.39592192, and CCCCCC/C=C/C (hexene) has a value of -63.98192049. The property values for these molecules are negative, and they become more negative as the chain length increases.

Given that CCCCCCCC (octane) is a straight-chain alkane with eight carbon atoms, it is expected to have a property value that is more negative than that of heptanol but less negative than that of more complex or larger molecules.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (octane) would be around -400.0.

The molecule in question, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, contains multiple cyclohexane rings, a cyclopentanone moiety, a hydroxyl group, and an alkyne group. This structure is somewhat similar to the complex polycyclic structures seen in some of the examples, such as CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO and CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, which have property values of -1682.46103467 and -1966.33311823, respectively.

Given the complexity and the presence of similar functional groups and ring systems, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C will be in a similar range. Therefore, a predicted property value for this molecule could be approximately -1800.0.

True Property: -2669.849052628284
Predicted Property:
Predicting the specific property value for a complex molecule like the one you've provided requires a detailed understanding of the molecular structure and its relationship to the property in question. The examples you've given suggest that the property might be related to some form of energy, stability, or reactivity, possibly a calculated thermodynamic property or a quantum chemical descriptor.

The molecule you've provided, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic and heterocyclic components. This complexity suggests that the property value could be significantly influenced by the presence of these functional groups and the overall molecular topology.

Given the examples, it seems that larger, more complex molecules with multiple rings and heteroatoms tend to have more negative property values, possibly indicating a lower energy state or greater stability. The presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters, and phenols) might also contribute to this trend.

Based on these considerations and the patterns observed in the examples, I would predict that the property value for the given molecule is likely to be a large negative number, reflecting its complexity and the presence of stabilizing functional groups.

Therefore, my predicted property value for the molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 is approximately:

These examples suggest that the presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) and a halogen (Cl) on a benzene ring could result in a property value in a similar range.

Considering the structural similarity to these examples and the presence of both an OH group and a Cl atom, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around 700. However, given the specific examples and their values, a more precise prediction would be:

The molecule in question combines these features, suggesting a balance between the positive influence of the chlorinated aromatic ring and the negative influence of the ester and amide groups. Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the property value is likely to be negative, but not as extreme as the highly functionalized examples.

The presence of multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings suggests a property value that could be influenced by these electronegative and conjugated systems. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings tend to have property values that are either moderately positive or negative, depending on the specific arrangement and additional functional groups.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of chlorine atoms, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl would be around -500.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCOC=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCOC=O is an ester with a relatively simple structure, similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's consider the example CCCCCCC=O, which is a ketone with a similar carbon chain length and has a property value of -311.80370893. The presence of an ester group (COC=O) in CCCCCOC=O might slightly alter the property value compared to a ketone, but the overall structure is still quite similar.

Given the examples and the structural similarity, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be slightly different from that of CCCCCCC=O, but not drastically so. Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCCCOC=O could be around -300.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we can look for similar structures in the provided examples. The molecule ClCCl is dichloromethane, which is a small, simple molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a central carbon.

In the examples, we have the molecule ClCCCl, which is 1,2-dichloroethane, with a property value of -1421.94854587. Dichloromethane (ClCCl) is structurally similar but smaller, with one less carbon and one less chlorine compared to 1,2-dichloroethane.

Given that ClCCl is a smaller molecule, we can expect its property value to be less negative than that of ClCCCl. However, without a clear pattern or formula to directly calculate the property, we can only make an educated guess based on the trend observed.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be slightly less negative than -1421.94854587. A plausible estimate could be around -1200, considering the reduction in size and complexity. However, this is a rough estimate and should be taken with caution.

Considering the structure of Cc1cccc(C)c1O, which is less complex than CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O but more complex than Oc1cccc(O)c1, we can estimate that its property value would be between these two values. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be around 690.0.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl, which is similar to the example Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 185.28078933. 

The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl has fewer chlorine atoms than the example, which suggests that its property value might be slightly different. However, given the structural similarity and the pattern observed in the examples, the property value is likely to be in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl would be approximately 185.28078933, considering the structural similarity and the trend in the provided data.

True Property: 799.0642724746111
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple hydrocarbon with a branched structure and a double bond.

Looking at the examples, we can see that simple hydrocarbons like CCCCCCCC (octane) have a property value of -366.39592192, and CCCCCCCC=C (nonene) has a property value of -36.16825383. The presence of a double bond in nonene results in a less negative property value compared to octane.

Isoprene is smaller than nonene and has a branched structure, which might affect the property value. Given the trend that smaller and less complex hydrocarbons tend to have less negative or even positive property values, we can predict that isoprene will have a property value closer to zero or slightly positive.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C (isoprene) would be around 50.

Dichloromethane is a relatively simple molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a single carbon atom. In the examples, simpler molecules with halogen atoms, such as ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl, have relatively high property values. However, ClCCl is less complex than these examples, suggesting a lower property value.

Considering the examples and the simplicity of ClCCl, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be around 1000.0. This value reflects the presence of chlorine atoms, which tend to increase the property value, but also accounts for the simplicity of the molecule compared to more complex structures in the examples.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -56.66275602925446
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is ethyl benzoate, which is an ester formed from benzoic acid and ethanol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with aromatic rings, such as benzene derivatives, tend to have property values that are not extremely high or low, often around the range of -1000 to 1000.
2. Esters, such as CCOC(=O)OC (methyl acetate), have a property value of 475.66917444.
3. The presence of an aromatic ring, as in the case of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, suggests a property value similar to other aromatic esters.

Considering these observations, the property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is likely to be in the range of other aromatic esters. Based on the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be approximately 475.66917444, similar to other esters with aromatic components.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -366.39592191884475
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups and the overall size of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached, specifically a heptyl bromide. In the examples, we have a few similar structures:

1. CCCCCCCCO (octanol) with a property value of -366.39592192.
2. CCCCCCC=C (heptene) with a property value of -202.48357194.
3. Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (bromobenzene) with a property value of 201.64530593.

The presence of the bromine atom in CCCCCCCBr is similar to the bromobenzene example, which has a positive property value. However, the linear alkyl chain structure is more similar to the octanol and heptene examples, which have negative property values.

Considering the linear alkyl chain and the presence of bromine, the property value is likely to be influenced by both the alkyl chain length and the bromine atom. The bromine atom may increase the property value compared to a similar alkane without bromine, but the overall structure suggests a negative value due to the alkyl chain.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be slightly negative, similar to the octanol example but adjusted for the presence of bromine. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately:

-250.0

SMILES: CO
True Property: -3274.7589721483005
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the molecule carbon monoxide (CO) based on the given examples is challenging without additional context about what the property represents. However, I can attempt to make an educated guess based on the patterns observed in the provided data.

The examples include a variety of molecules with different functional groups and structures, and their associated property values range widely, including both positive and negative values. The property could be related to energy, stability, or some other chemical characteristic.

Carbon monoxide is a small, simple molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is known for its stability and strong bonding. Given the examples, smaller and simpler molecules tend to have less extreme property values compared to larger, more complex molecules.

Based on this reasoning, I would predict a property value for CO that is relatively moderate and possibly negative, considering the examples of small molecules like CCC and CCBr, which have negative values.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO could be around -200.0. However, this is a speculative estimate without knowing the exact nature of the property being measured.
