True Property: 2.5242666667015006
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the patterns from the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a linear chain of 10 carbon atoms with an ester functional group at the end. From the examples, we can observe that:

- Linear alkanes like CCCCCCC (heptane) have a property value of 3.25460661.
- The molecule CCCCCCCC(C)O (a branched nonanol) also has a property value of 3.25460661.
- The molecule CCCCCCCC(=O)OC (octyl acetate) has a property value of 2.62862929.

Given that CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is similar to CCCCCCCC(=O)OC but with two additional carbon atoms, we can expect the property value to be slightly higher due to the increased chain length.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be slightly higher than 2.62862929, but still less than 3.25460661. A predicted value could be around 2.8.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Presence of Bromine (Br):** In the examples, the presence of halogens like chlorine (Cl) and bromine (Br) often correlates with negative property values. For instance, CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of -0.48800349.

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O):** The presence of carbonyl groups is also associated with negative property values. For example, O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC has a property value of 0.90524976, but this is in a cyclic structure with additional alkyl groups.

3. **Aromatic and Heterocyclic Structure:** The molecule has a pyrrole ring, which is a heterocyclic aromatic compound. In the examples, aromatic and heterocyclic structures with halogens and carbonyl groups tend to have negative property values, such as Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl with a value of -0.67449076.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular framework. The molecule you provided, c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, is biphenyl, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond.

In the examples, aromatic compounds with similar structures, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O has a property value of -0.67449076, and c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 also has a property value of -0.67449076. These examples suggest that aromatic systems without additional functional groups that significantly alter the property tend to have negative values.

Given that biphenyl is a simple aromatic compound without additional functional groups that would significantly alter its property, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value similar to other aromatic compounds in the examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 is approximately -0.67449076.

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the patterns in the given examples. The examples show that molecules with long carbon chains, especially those that are aliphatic and lack polar or highly electronegative groups, tend to have higher property values. For instance, molecules like C1CCC2CCCCC2C1, CC(O)C(C)(C)C, and CCCCCCC(C)C all have property values around 3.25460661.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear aliphatic chain with a sulfur atom at the end. The presence of sulfur, which is less electronegative than oxygen and nitrogen, might slightly reduce the property value compared to a purely hydrocarbon chain, but it is still likely to be relatively high due to the aliphatic nature of the molecule.

Based on this reasoning, the predicted property value for CCCCCS is likely to be close to those of similar aliphatic chains. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately 3.25460661.

The molecule "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C" has a property value of 0.04715765. The given molecule "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C" is structurally similar, with the main difference being the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) attached to the bicyclic urea structure.

Considering the structural similarity and the nature of the substituents, the property value is likely to be close to that of the similar example. The additional alkyl chain might slightly increase the property value due to increased hydrophobicity or steric effects.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C" would be slightly higher than 0.04715765. A predicted value could be around 0.1.

These examples suggest that the presence of halogens on aromatic rings tends to result in negative property values.

Given that trifluoromethyl is a strong electron-withdrawing group similar to halogens, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 will also be negative and similar to those of the halogenated aromatic compounds.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 1.512366924026521
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the patterns from the given examples. The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. 

From the examples, we observe that simple esters and alcohols tend to have higher property values, often around 2.0 or higher. For instance, CCC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of 2.00447284, and CCCCCCCOC(=O)C has a property value of 2.15989687. These examples suggest that esters with relatively simple structures and without additional functional groups like nitro or halogen groups tend to have higher property values.

Given that CC(C)OC=O is a simple ester without additional complex functional groups, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar to those of other simple esters. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O is approximately 2.00447284.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is structurally similar to Cc1cccc(C)c1, which has a property value of -0.06045323. The presence of the hydroxyl group (O) in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 could influence the property value, potentially making it more negative due to increased polarity or hydrogen bonding capability.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be slightly more negative than -0.06045323, but not as negative as the highly substituted or halogenated aromatic compounds. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.1.

The molecule in question has a thiophosphate group (COP(=S)(OC)O) attached to an aromatic ring with a thioether (SC) and a methyl group (C) substituent. Let's break down the structural features:

1. **Thiophosphate Group**: The presence of a thiophosphate group (P=S) is similar to the molecules COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, both of which have a property value of -0.25186116.

2. **Aromatic Ring with Substituents**: The molecule has an aromatic ring with a thioether (SC) and a methyl group (C) substituent. The presence of a methyl group on an aromatic ring is seen in molecules like Cc1ccc(O)c(C)c1 and Cc1ccc(O)cc1C, both of which have a property value of -0.25186116.

3. **Thioether Substituent**: The thioether (SC) group is not directly represented in the examples, but it is a sulfur-containing group similar to the thiophosphate group.

Considering these structural similarities, particularly the presence of the thiophosphate group and the methyl-substituted aromatic ring, the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to have a property value similar to those with the thiophosphate group and methyl-substituted aromatic rings.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is approximately **-0.25186116**.

True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and shape of the molecule.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to a propyl chain (CCC). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as N#Cc1ccccc1C#N and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, tend to have negative property values. Additionally, smaller molecules with simple alkyl chains, like CCC, have positive property values.

Considering these observations, the presence of the nitro group in CCCN(=O)=O is likely to contribute a negative influence on the property value, while the propyl chain may contribute positively. Balancing these factors, the property value for CCCN(=O)=O is likely to be slightly negative.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O is approximately -0.2.

Molecules with simple alkane chains or cyclic structures without significant polar or reactive groups tend to have higher property values, often around 3.25460661. In contrast, molecules with polar groups, aromatic rings, or heteroatoms tend to have lower property values, often negative.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic structure with a tertiary alcohol group. This structure is somewhat similar to other cyclic or bicyclic molecules in the examples, such as CC1CCCO1, which has a property value of 3.25460661.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with a benzene ring and alkyl substituents tend to have property values around -0.06045323 to 0.11590812. For instance, CCc1ccc(C)cc1 has a property value of -0.06045323, and CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 has a property value of 0.11590812.

Given that CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is similar in structure to these examples, with an isobutyl group instead of a propyl or isopropyl group, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will fall within this range. Considering the slight increase in alkyl chain length, the property value might be slightly higher than -0.06045323 but still close to the range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is approximately 0.11590812.

Given the structure of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, which is a dichlorinated biphenyl, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar to those of other chlorinated aromatic compounds. Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately -0.67449076.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.11590812147988304
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Simple aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions, such as Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) and Cc1ccccc1N (toluene), have negative property values, specifically -0.45758419.
- The presence of additional alkyl groups tends to increase the property value, as seen in molecules like CCC(CC)C=O (2.00447284) and CCCCCCC(=O)OCC (2.28113825).

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a diethylbenzene, it is more similar to the alkyl-substituted aromatic compounds. However, it is more alkylated than toluene or aniline, which suggests a property value closer to zero or slightly positive, but not as high as the highly alkylated or oxygenated compounds.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be around -0.17350217, similar to CCc1ccccn1, which is a simple alkylated aromatic compound. However, given the additional ethyl group, it might be slightly higher, but still negative.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is approximately -0.17350217.

In the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups (N(=O)=O), tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.67449076, and other aromatic compounds with similar electron-withdrawing groups also have negative values.

Given the presence of the sulfonamide group, which is electron-withdrawing, and the aromatic ring, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O will also be negative and similar to those of other aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is approximately -0.67449076.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several functional groups and structural features that can influence its property value:

1. **Ester Groups (COC(=O))**: The presence of ester groups is common in molecules with positive property values, as seen in examples like CCCCCC(=O)OC (2.00447284) and CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC (1.79829257).

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The nitro group is often associated with negative property values, as seen in examples like CCCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O (0.56145815) and Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-0.45758419).

3. **Aromatic Rings**: The presence of aromatic rings can contribute to both positive and negative property values, depending on the other functional groups present.

4. **Overall Structure**: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, which can lead to a more negative property value due to the presence of the nitro group and the aromatic system.

Considering these factors and comparing with the examples, the presence of the nitro group and the aromatic system suggests a more negative property value. However, the ester groups might slightly offset this negativity.

Based on the analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately:

-0.20260968

This value is chosen considering the balance between the negative influence of the nitro group and the potential positive influence of the ester groups, similar to the example CNC(=O)Oc1cccc(N=CN(C)C)c1 (-0.20260968).

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a bicyclic compound with two amide groups. It resembles a diketopiperazine structure, which is a cyclic dipeptide. In the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and halogens tend to have negative property values, while aliphatic and saturated hydrocarbons tend to have positive values.

The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 does not contain any aromatic rings or halogens, and it is a relatively small, saturated, cyclic compound. Based on the examples, such structures often have property values closer to zero or slightly negative, especially if they are not highly hydrophobic or aromatic.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be slightly negative, similar to other small cyclic or heterocyclic compounds in the examples. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately:

SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 3.2546066103742386
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

In the given examples, simple aliphatic hydrocarbons like CCCCC and CCC(C)(C)CC have higher property values (around 3.25), while aromatic compounds and those with multiple halogens or heteroatoms tend to have lower or negative property values.

The molecule ClCC is a simple aliphatic compound with a chlorine atom attached. The presence of a chlorine atom often results in a lower property value compared to a similar hydrocarbon without chlorine. For instance, Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) has a property value of -0.67449076, which is lower than benzene itself.

Considering the simplicity of ClCC and the presence of a single chlorine atom, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is lower than that of simple hydrocarbons like CCCCC but not as low as those with multiple halogens or complex aromatic structures.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be around 0.42579477, similar to CC#N, which is a simple molecule with a small modification (a cyano group).

The molecule contains:
- Aromatic rings (phenyl groups)
- Phosphoryl group (P=O)
- Ether linkages (O-P-O)

From the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl or NO2) tend to have negative property values. However, the presence of alkyl groups (like methyl groups) and ether linkages can increase the property value.

- O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12 has a property value of -0.67449076.

Given the presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups in the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Based on the examples, a value around -0.67449076 seems consistent with the structural features of the molecule.

Therefore, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O is approximately -0.67449076.

Given the presence of similar functional groups and the overall electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O will also be negative and close to those examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule is approximately -0.67449076.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: -0.25186115933029796
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- Two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are similar to the phosphorothioate group in the example molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 0.29963624.
- Two aromatic rings connected by a sulfur atom, which is somewhat similar to the structure of aromatic compounds with substituents, such as Cc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 with a property value of -0.56498086.

The presence of multiple phosphorothioate groups and aromatic rings suggests that the molecule might have a property value influenced by both the electron-withdrawing nature of the phosphorothioate groups and the aromatic system.

Given the examples, the presence of phosphorothioate groups tends to increase the property value, while aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups tend to decrease it. Balancing these effects, the property value is likely to be close to that of the example with a phosphorothioate group, but slightly lower due to the additional aromatic system.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 would be approximately 0.2.

True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can see that molecules with nitro groups attached to aromatic rings, such as Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.45758419. Additionally, other aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have negative property values.

Given this information, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is likely to be similar to other nitroaromatic compounds. Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O

This molecule is a complex sugar, likely a polysaccharide or a derivative, given the multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic ether structures. In the examples provided, molecules with high property values (around 3.25460661) are typically long-chain hydrocarbons or simple halogenated compounds like CBr, which are likely associated with high hydrophobicity or low polarity.

The molecule in question, with its multiple hydroxyl groups, is highly polar and hydrophilic, similar to the structure of sugars. In the examples, highly polar and hydrophilic molecules, such as those with multiple hydroxyl groups or aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups, tend to have negative property values.

Given this analysis, the predicted property value for the molecule OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O is likely to be negative, reflecting its high polarity and hydrophilicity.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.4257947679919579
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that molecules with triple bonds, particularly those with nitrile groups (C#N), tend to have negative property values. However, the molecule CCC#C is a simple alkyne (1-butyne), which is a hydrocarbon with a triple bond but without any electronegative atoms like nitrogen.

In the examples, hydrocarbons with only carbon and hydrogen, such as alkanes and alkenes, generally have positive property values. For instance, long-chain alkanes like CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO have a property value of 3.25460661, and shorter alkanes like CCC(=O)C have a property value of 1.79829257. The presence of a triple bond in CCC#C might slightly reduce the property value compared to similar alkanes, but it is still expected to be positive.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be slightly lower than that of similar alkanes but still positive. Therefore, a predicted property value for CCC#C could be around 1.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

2. **Phosphorothioate Group**: The presence of a phosphorothioate group (P=S) is a unique feature. In the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, the property value is 0.29963624. This suggests that the phosphorothioate group might contribute positively to the property value.

3. **Alkyl Chains**: The molecule has ethyl groups (CC) attached to the phosphorothioate, which are similar to alkyl chains in other examples with positive property values, such as CCCCCCC(C)O with a value of 3.25460661.

Considering these factors, the chlorinated aromatic ring suggests a negative contribution, while the phosphorothioate and alkyl chains suggest a positive contribution. Balancing these influences, the property value is likely to be slightly negative or close to zero.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is approximately:

- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, have a property value of 1.79829257.
- Molecules with cyclic structures, such as C/C1CCC(\C)CC1, also have higher property values (around 3.25460661).

Considering these observations, the presence of the phosphorothioate group, the amide linkage, and the piperidine ring suggests that the property value for CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is likely to be on the higher side, similar to those with sulfur-containing groups and cyclic structures.

From the examples, we can observe that phenolic compounds, such as Oc1cccc(O)c1 and Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have property values of -0.67449076. Additionally, the example CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, which is a similar structure with a tertiary butyl group instead of a methyl group, has a property value of 0.11590812.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is 2-methyl-1-butene, which is a small, branched alkene. In the examples, small alkenes and alkanes tend to have positive property values, often related to their hydrophobic nature and lack of polar functional groups.

For instance:

This molecule appears to be quite complex, with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and a sugar-like moiety. Let's break down the structural features:

1. **Aromatic Rings and Substituents**: The molecule contains aromatic rings with methoxy (OC) and hydroxy (O) groups. These are similar to some of the molecules with negative property values, such as those with nitro groups or other electron-withdrawing groups.

2. **Sugar-like Moiety**: The presence of a sugar-like structure with multiple hydroxyl groups is reminiscent of molecules like OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O, which have a positive property value (3.25460661).

Given these observations, the molecule has features that could contribute to both positive and negative property values. However, the presence of the sugar-like moiety and the overall complexity suggest a positive property value. 

Considering the examples, the molecule's complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, including the sugar-like moiety, suggest a property value that is positive but not as high as the simplest alkanes or alcohols. A reasonable prediction, considering the balance of features, would be around 1.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the given molecule is approximately:

- A thioether group (CS-)
- A pyrazole ring (1,2,4-triazole-like structure)
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- A tertiary butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

From the examples, molecules with similar heterocyclic structures and functional groups tend to have negative property values, especially those with nitrogen-containing rings and carbonyl groups. For instance:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a property value of 1.25220529, but it also contains an additional oxygen and sulfur, which might contribute to a higher value.
- Nc1c(C)c[nH]c(=O)n1 has a property value of -0.35305279, which is more similar in terms of nitrogen-containing rings and carbonyl groups.

Considering these observations, the presence of the thioether group might slightly increase the property value, but the overall structure suggests a negative value due to the heterocyclic and carbonyl components.

In the examples, small and simple molecules like NC(=O)N and NC(=O)c1ccccc1 tend to have negative property values. Additionally, molecules with polar functional groups or high electronegativity differences, such as those containing nitro groups or carbonyl groups, also tend to have negative property values.

Given that CO is a small molecule with a significant electronegativity difference between carbon and oxygen, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for CO. Based on the examples, a plausible prediction for the property value of CO would be around -0.67449076, which is a common value for small, polar molecules in the dataset.
