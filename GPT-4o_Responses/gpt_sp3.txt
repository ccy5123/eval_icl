SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.9090909090909091
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property value is related to the structure of the molecule, possibly reflecting some aspect of its chemical or physical properties. The examples with long carbon chains and ester groups, such as "CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC" with a property value of 0.9230769230769231, suggest that the property value increases with longer carbon chains and the presence of certain functional groups like esters.

The molecule "CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC" is similar to "CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC" but with two fewer carbon atoms in the chain. Given the trend observed in the examples, the property value for "CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC" is likely slightly lower than 0.9230769230769231.

Therefore, I would predict the property value for "CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC" to be approximately 0.9.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxygen and a nitrogen atom. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings and heteroatoms.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with aromatic rings and heteroatoms, such as nitrogen and oxygen, tend to have lower property values, often around 0.0 to 0.25. For instance:
- c1cncnc1 has a property value of 0.0.
- Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 0.0.
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1O has a property value of 0.0.

Given the presence of the aromatic ring, the heteroatoms, and the chlorine substituent, the property value for Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is likely to be on the lower end of the scale.

Therefore, I predict the property value for Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 to be 0.0.

Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is a nitro compound, specifically 2-nitropropane. Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property value is influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule. Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) appear to contribute to a higher property value, as seen in the example Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, which has a property value of 0.5.

Given this pattern, and considering the relatively simple structure of 2-nitropropane compared to the more complex structures with similar property values, I would predict the property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O to be 0.5.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and alcohols. Let's analyze the examples:

1. Molecules with high symmetry and aromaticity, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tend to have lower property values (e.g., 0.0 for Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 and c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54).
2. Molecules with aliphatic chains and simple functional groups, such as alcohols and ketones, tend to have higher property values (e.g., 1.0 for CC(C)CCCO and CC(C)Cl).
3. Complex structures with multiple rings and functional groups, such as steroids or terpenes, tend to have intermediate property values (e.g., 0.8095238095238095 for CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C).

The given molecule has a complex polycyclic structure with ketone and alcohol groups, similar to the example with a property value of 0.8095238095238095. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict a similar intermediate property value for this molecule.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property value is influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and structural features. Molecules with halogens (like Cl and F) on aromatic rings often have a property value of 0.0. Additionally, the presence of amide groups (NC(=O)) and other polar functional groups can also influence the property value.

The molecule in question, Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, contains two fluorine atoms on an aromatic ring, an amide linkage, and a chlorinated aromatic ring. These features are similar to those in molecules that have been assigned a property value of 0.0 in the examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 is 0.0.

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the patterns and characteristics of the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall complexity of the molecule.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a relatively simple structure with an ether functional group (COC) and a branched alkane. In the examples, simple alkanes and ethers tend to have higher property values, often around 1.0, especially when they are not heavily substituted with other functional groups that might lower the value.

Given this analysis, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is likely to be 1.0.

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.5555555555555556
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with two carbonyl groups and a bromine atom. Let's break down the features:

1. **Presence of Bromine (Br):** In the examples, molecules with halogens, particularly bromine, tend to have lower property values unless they are simple alkyl halides (e.g., CCCCCCCBr, 1.0). However, in more complex structures, the presence of bromine is associated with lower values (e.g., CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, 0.125).

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O):** The presence of carbonyl groups often correlates with lower property values, as seen in several examples (e.g., CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, 0.125; CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, 0.2222222222222222).

3. **Aromatic/heteroaromatic ring:** The molecule contains a pyrrole ring, which is a heteroaromatic system. In the examples, aromatic systems with additional functional groups tend to have lower property values (e.g., COc1ccc(Cl)cc1, 0.14285714285714285).

4. **Alkyl Chain (CCC(C)):** The presence of an alkyl chain can increase the property value, but in this case, the other functional groups (carbonyls and bromine) are likely to have a more significant impact.

Considering these factors, the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O is likely to have a property value on the lower end of the spectrum, similar to other molecules with carbonyl groups and halogens.

Based on the analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately **0.125**.

The molecule you provided, c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, is biphenyl, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples you provided, molecules with purely aromatic structures, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tend to have a property value of 0.0. This is likely due to the lack of functional groups or features that would contribute to the property being measured.

Based on this pattern, I would predict that the property value for biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) is 0.0.
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property value is related to the structure of the molecule, possibly considering factors like the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of saturation, or the overall complexity of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear alkane with a thiol group at the end. In the examples, linear alkanes like CCC1CCCCC1 and C1CCC2CCCCC2C1 have a property value of 1.0. The presence of a sulfur atom in CCCCCS might slightly alter this value, but given the examples, it seems that the presence of heteroatoms like sulfur in simple structures doesn't drastically change the property value from 1.0, as seen in the example of CCCCS, which is not provided but can be inferred from similar structures.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCS is likely to be close to 1.0.

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.09090909090909091
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is a naphthalene derivative, which is a bicyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Simple aromatic hydrocarbons like benzene (c1ccccc1) have a property value of 0.0.
- Substituted aromatic hydrocarbons with alkyl groups, such as Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, have a property value of 0.16666666666666666.
- The presence of additional alkyl groups tends to increase the property value slightly, as seen in Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1 with a value of 0.3333333333333333.

The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is similar to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, which has a property value of 0.16666666666666666. Given that the structure is a naphthalene with a methyl group, it is reasonable to predict a similar property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately 0.16666666666666666.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 0.5833333333333334
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a cyclic compound with a similar core structure to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of 0.375. The main difference between the two molecules is the substitution of a methyl group (C) with a more complex alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the new molecule.

The examples suggest that the presence of additional alkyl chains or branching tends to increase the property value, as seen in examples like CC(C)C (1.0) and CCC(O)CC (1.0). However, the core structure of the molecule, which is a cyclic imide, tends to have a lower property value, as seen in the example with a value of 0.375.

Considering these factors, the substitution of a methyl group with a more complex alkyl chain might slightly increase the property value compared to the example with a value of 0.375. However, the increase might not be substantial due to the dominant influence of the cyclic imide structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be slightly higher than 0.375, but not significantly so. A predicted value could be around 0.4.

True Property: 0.14285714285714285

To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached.

From the examples, we notice that molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1 and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, have a property value of 0.0. These examples suggest that the presence of halogens on aromatic rings tends to result in a property value of 0.0.

Given that trifluoromethylbenzene has a similar structure with a halogenated aromatic ring, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is also 0.0.

Based on the examples provided, molecules with multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a property value of 1.0. This is likely due to the high solubility and hydrophilicity associated with the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups. Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is 1.0.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C

This molecule appears to be a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Cyclic Structure**: The molecule contains multiple fused rings, similar to some of the examples provided, such as CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of 0.8181818181818182.

2. **Functional Groups**: The presence of ketone groups (C=O) and an ester group (CC(=O)O) is notable. These groups can influence the property value, as seen in other examples with ketones and esters.

3. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The molecule also contains hydroxyl groups (O), which can affect the property value. In the examples, molecules with hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a property value of 1.0, but this is a linear structure, unlike the cyclic structure here.

4. **Complexity and Size**: The complexity and size of the molecule, with multiple rings and functional groups, suggest a higher property value, similar to other large cyclic structures.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be close to those of other complex cyclic structures with multiple functional groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is:

True Property: 0.9473684210526315
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O is a polycyclic compound with multiple cyclohexane rings and a ketone group. This structure is similar to the example CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 0.6666666666666666. Both molecules have a similar polycyclic framework and an oxygen-containing functional group.

Given the structural similarity, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O will be close to 0.6666666666666666. Therefore, the predicted property value for this molecule is 0.6666666666666666.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.125
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O contains an acetamide group (CC(=O)N) attached to a nitrobenzene ring (c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O). From the examples, we can observe that molecules containing nitro groups attached to aromatic rings, such as O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 and O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12, have a property value of 0.0. This suggests that the presence of a nitro group on an aromatic ring significantly influences the property value towards 0.0.

Additionally, the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which also contains a nitro group on an aromatic ring, has a property value of 0.14285714285714285. This indicates that the presence of other functional groups, such as methoxy, can slightly increase the property value.

Considering the structure of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, the acetamide group may have a minor influence, but the dominant feature is the nitro group on the aromatic ring. Therefore, the property value is likely to be closer to those examples with nitro groups on aromatic rings.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O would be approximately 0.14285714285714285.

True Property: 0.4166666666666667
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule "CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12", we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- An organophosphorus group (P=O and P=S)
- An aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent
- A thioether linkage (S-C)
- An ester linkage (C=O-O)
- A heterocyclic aromatic ring (oxazole)

From the examples, it seems that the presence of halogens (like Cl) and certain aromatic systems often correlate with lower property values, especially when multiple halogens are present. However, the presence of functional groups like esters and ethers can increase the property value.

Given the complexity of the molecule and the presence of both electron-withdrawing (Cl) and electron-donating groups (ethers), along with the sulfur and phosphorus functionalities, the property value is likely to be moderate.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.2.

The molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is a bicyclic compound with two nitrogen atoms in each ring, resembling a purine-like structure. In the examples, molecules with similar heterocyclic structures, particularly those with nitrogen atoms, tend to have lower property values. For instance, the molecule Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F has a property value of 0.0, and COc2ncc1nccnc1n2 has a property value of 0.14285714285714285.

Given the presence of nitrogen atoms and the bicyclic structure, it is reasonable to predict a low property value for this molecule. Based on the pattern observed in the examples, a property value of 0.0 seems appropriate for O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12.

To predict the property value for the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 contains:
- A sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N), which is a polar functional group.
- An aromatic ring (phenyl group) with an amine substituent, which can contribute to polarity and potential hydrogen bonding.
- An additional amine group attached to the sulfonamide nitrogen, which further increases polarity.

From the examples, molecules with high polarity and multiple polar functional groups, such as nitro groups or sulfonamides, tend to have lower property values (often 0.0). For instance, molecules like Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl have a property value of 0.0.

Given the presence of the sulfonamide group and the overall polar nature of the molecule, it is reasonable to predict a low property value. Therefore, the predicted property value for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is likely to be:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a feature seen in some molecules with low property values (e.g., Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, 0.0).
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which can influence the property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
- An alkene group (C=C) in the side chain, which is a feature seen in some molecules with higher property values (e.g., CCCCCC=C, 0.7777777777777778).

Considering these features, the presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups (two nitro groups and a trifluoromethyl group) suggests a lower property value, as seen in other molecules with similar features. However, the presence of an alkene group might slightly increase the property value compared to molecules with only electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on these considerations and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 0.1.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. From the examples, we can observe that simple esters and alcohols tend to have higher property values, often close to or equal to 1.0. For instance, CCC(C)(C)O has a property value of 1.0, and CC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of 0.8333333333333334.

Given that CC(C)OC=O is a relatively simple ester, similar to the examples with high property values, it is reasonable to predict a high property value for this molecule as well. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O is likely to be around 0.8333333333333334.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Simple aromatic compounds with hydroxyl groups, like phenols, tend to have lower property values.
- The presence of additional alkyl groups, such as methyl groups, can slightly increase the property value, but not significantly.

For instance:
- The molecule c1ccccc1O (phenol) has a property value of 0.0.
- The molecule Cc1cccc(N)c1, which is a methyl-substituted aniline, has a property value of 0.14285714285714285.

Given that Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a methyl-substituted phenol, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be slightly higher than that of phenol but not as high as more complex or heavily substituted aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is approximately 0.14285714285714285.

The molecule contains a thiophosphate group (COP(=S)(OC)O-) attached to an aromatic ring with a methyl group (c(C)c1) and a thiol group (SC) on the ring. In the examples, molecules with similar thiophosphate groups attached to aromatic rings, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, have a property value of 0.25.

The presence of the thiol group (SC) and the methyl group (C) on the aromatic ring in the target molecule is somewhat similar to the halogen substitutions in the examples, which do not significantly alter the property value from 0.25.

Therefore, based on the structural similarities and the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is 0.25.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to a propyl chain (CCC). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, have a property value of 0.0. This suggests that the presence of nitro groups might contribute to a lower property value.

Additionally, simple alkyl chains like CCC, CCCC, and CCCCC have high property values (1.0), but the introduction of functional groups like nitro seems to reduce this value.

Considering these observations, the presence of the nitro group in CCCN(=O)=O is likely to lower the property value compared to a simple alkyl chain. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 0.0, similar to other nitro-containing compounds in the examples.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzodiazepine-like structure, featuring a ketone group and an aromatic ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of 0.125. Both molecules contain aromatic rings and a ketone group, although the example molecule is more complex with additional aromatic rings and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle.

Given the structural similarities and the complexity of the example molecule, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be in a similar range, but potentially slightly higher due to its simpler structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be approximately 0.14285714285714285, which is consistent with simpler aromatic structures in the examples.

The examples show that simple alkanes and alcohols tend to have a property value of 1.0, while aromatic compounds with halogens often have a value of 0.0. Esters and other functional groups show a range of values.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is an ester, specifically an ethyl ester of a hexanoic acid. Looking at the examples, esters like CCCCCC(=O)OC have a property value of 0.9, and other esters like CCOC(=O)N have a value of 0.6666666666666666.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with simple hydrocarbon chains or rings, especially those with double bonds, tend to have higher property values. For instance, CCC(C)(C)CC has a property value of 1.0, and CC/C=C/C has a property value of 0.6.
- Molecules with more complex structures, especially those containing heteroatoms or aromatic rings, tend to have lower property values.

Given that C=CCC=C is a relatively simple linear hydrocarbon with conjugated double bonds, it is likely to have a higher property value compared to more complex or aromatic structures.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C would be around 0.6, similar to other simple hydrocarbons with double bonds.

True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property value is influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is a simple, symmetrical molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon. This structure is similar to other halogenated compounds, particularly those with multiple halogens, which tend to have lower property values in the examples provided.

Given this analysis, the predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br is likely to be low, similar to other halogenated compounds. Therefore, I would predict a property value of 0.0 for BrC(Br)Br.

- Molecules with simpler structures or more alkyl chains tend to have higher property values.

The molecule in question has a relatively complex structure with multiple functional groups and an aromatic ring, similar to some of the examples with lower property values. For instance, the molecule "COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1" has a property value of 0.46153846153846156, and it shares some structural similarities with the molecule in question, such as the presence of a phosphorothioate group and an aromatic ring.

True Property: 0.4
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A tertiary amide group (CN(C)C(=O)N).
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)).
- A nitro group (n2nc(oc2=O)).
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C).

From the examples, we observe:
- Molecules with nitro groups on aromatic rings often have a property value of 0.0 (e.g., Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O).
- Molecules with chlorinated aromatic rings also tend to have a property value of 0.0 (e.g., Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl).
- The presence of a tert-butyl group in some examples (e.g., CC(C)N(=O)=O) does not significantly alter the property value from 0.0 when combined with other groups that lead to 0.0.

Considering these observations, the presence of both a nitro group and a chlorinated aromatic ring in the molecule suggests a property value of 0.0, as these features are dominant in determining the property value in the examples provided.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C is 0.0.

The molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is a chlorinated aromatic compound with two phenolic groups and multiple chlorine atoms. Based on the examples provided, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings tend to have a property value of 0.0. This is likely due to the electron-withdrawing nature of chlorine and the stability of the aromatic system, which may lead to a lower reactivity or solubility in certain contexts. Therefore, the predicted property value for this molecule is 0.0.

SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.23529411764705882
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we need to analyze its structure and compare it to the examples provided.

This molecule is a tertiary amide with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. It has a central carbonyl group (C=O) and a tertiary butyl group (C(C)(C)) attached to the nitrogen. The presence of aromatic rings and the amide functional group suggests some degree of polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, but the bulky groups and lack of highly polar functional groups like nitro or sulfonyl groups suggest it is less polar than some of the examples with a property value of 0.0.

Comparing it to the examples:
- Molecules with extensive aromatic character and polar groups like nitro or sulfonyl tend to have a property value of 0.0.
- Molecules with a mix of aromatic and aliphatic character, especially with amide or ester groups, tend to have intermediate values (e.g., 0.125, 0.3, 0.42857142857142855).

Given the structure of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, it is similar to CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 0.125. The presence of the tertiary butyl group might increase the property value slightly due to increased hydrophobic character.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be around 0.2.

True Property: 0.125
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-).
- A phenyl ring with a bromine substituent (c1ccc(Br)cc1).

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents (e.g., Br, Cl) tend to have a property value of 0.0.
- The presence of an acetamide group (as in CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 0.1875) might slightly increase the property value, but not significantly.

Considering these observations, the presence of the bromine on the aromatic ring is likely to dominate the property value, leading to a prediction closer to 0.0. However, the acetamide group might slightly increase it from 0.0.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around 0.1.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with simple alkyl chains or alcohol groups tend to have higher property values (e.g., CC(C)CO, CCCCC(O)CC, CC1CCCCC1).
- Molecules with aromatic rings and additional functional groups, such as nitro or halogen groups, tend to have lower property values (e.g., Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O).
- Molecules with a combination of alkyl chains and aromatic rings have intermediate property values (e.g., CCc1ccc(C)cc1, C=Cc1ccccc1).

The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 has an alkyl chain attached to an aromatic ring, similar to CCc1ccc(C)cc1, which has a property value of 0.3333333333333333. Given the presence of the isobutyl group, which is slightly bulkier than a simple propyl group, the property value might be slightly higher but still in the intermediate range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is approximately 0.4.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we need to consider the patterns and structural features that might influence the property values in the given examples. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, it appears that molecules with aromatic rings and certain functional groups like nitro groups or halogens tend to have lower property values, often 0.0. For instance, molecules like NC(=O)c1ccccc1O and O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which have aromatic rings with additional functional groups, have a property value of 0.0.

Given that benzaldehyde has a simple aromatic structure with an aldehyde group, and considering the trend in the examples where similar aromatic structures with minimal additional functional groups have a property value of 0.0, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for O=Cc1ccccc1 is also 0.0.

- An aromatic ring with a heteroatom (oxygen), similar to some structures with a property value of 0.0.
- A cyclic amide structure (lactam), which is not directly seen in the examples but could influence the property.

Based on the examples, molecules with aromatic nitro groups and heteroatoms in the ring often have a property value of 0.0. The presence of the cyclic amide might not significantly alter this trend, as the examples suggest that the presence of nitro groups and aromatic heterocycles tends to dominate the property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is 0.0.

Considering the structural similarity to these examples, particularly the presence of amide bonds and a cyclic structure, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be close to these values.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately 0.75.

These values are relatively low compared to more complex or functionalized molecules.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a relatively simple aromatic hydrocarbon without additional functional groups that might significantly alter its property value, it is reasonable to predict a property value similar to those of other simple aromatic compounds.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is neither a simple aliphatic chain nor heavily substituted with electron-withdrawing groups. It has a mix of functional groups that could contribute to a moderate property value.

Considering the presence of the phosphoric acid ester and thioester, which are not as electron-withdrawing as multiple halogens, and the amide group, which is somewhat electron-withdrawing, the property value is likely to be moderate.

Based on these observations and comparisons, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around 0.3.

True Property: 0.25
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is often associated with polar and potentially hydrophilic properties.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which can also contribute to polarity.
- An aromatic ring (phenyl group), which is common in many of the examples with a property value of 0.0.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can contribute to some degree of polarity.

From the examples, molecules with significant aromatic character and polar functional groups, such as sulfonyl and amide, tend to have lower property values, often around 0.0. For instance, molecules like Oc1ccc(O)cc1 and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 have a property value of 0.0, likely due to their aromatic nature and polar substituents.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. This molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. 

From the examples, it seems that molecules with aromatic rings and halogens tend to have lower property values, often around 0.0. Molecules with aliphatic chains and oxygen-containing functional groups (like alcohols and esters) tend to have higher property values, often close to 1.0. 

The given molecule, O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, is a small, non-aromatic cyclic structure with amide groups. It lacks the features that are associated with higher property values in the examples, such as long aliphatic chains or multiple oxygen-containing functional groups.

True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the patterns from the given examples. The examples suggest that the property value is influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

In the examples, simple alkanes like CCCCC and CCC1CCCCC1 have a property value of 1.0, indicating that saturated hydrocarbons tend to have higher property values. On the other hand, aromatic compounds and those with multiple halogen substitutions, such as Clc1ccccc1 and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, have a property value of 0.0.

The molecule ClCC is a simple haloalkane, specifically chloroethane. It is not aromatic and does not have multiple halogen substitutions like the examples with a property value of 0.0. However, it is also not a saturated hydrocarbon like the alkanes with a property value of 1.0.

Considering the examples, the presence of a single halogen atom in a non-aromatic structure might suggest a property value between 0.0 and 1.0. The closest example to ClCC is CC#N, which has a property value of 0.5, and it is a small molecule with a polar group.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be around 0.5.

- The presence of multiple halogens on a benzene ring, such as in ClC(=C)Cl and O=N(=O)c1c(Cl)c(Cl)ccc1, also results in a property value of 0.0.

Given these observations, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1, which is similar in structure to the examples with a property value of 0.0, would also be 0.0. Therefore, the predicted property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is:

From the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (NO2) or halogens (Cl, F) often have lower property values, especially when they lack significant polar or reactive functional groups that might increase the property value.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O is likely to have a property value closer to those with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups, which tend to be lower.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have lower property values. For instance, the molecule O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which is dinitrobenzene, has a property value of 0.0. Similarly, the molecule c1ccccc1O, which is phenol, also has a property value of 0.0.

Given that COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has both a methoxy group and a nitro group on the benzene ring, the presence of the electron-withdrawing nitro group is likely to dominate the property value, leading to a lower value. Based on the pattern observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be 0.0.

This molecule is a complex sugar, likely a polysaccharide or a similar carbohydrate structure, characterized by multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups and ether linkages. In the examples provided, molecules with high symmetry, a high number of hydroxyl groups, or simple aliphatic chains tend to have property values close to 1.0. For instance, molecules like C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O and CBr have property values of 1.0.

Given the high number of hydroxyl groups and the complex, symmetrical structure of the sugar-like molecule, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be close to 1.0, similar to other highly hydroxylated or symmetrical molecules in the examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O is 1.0.

True Property: 0.4
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Presence of Chlorine (Cl) Substituents**: The molecule contains three chlorine atoms attached to a benzene ring. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl, have a property value of 0.0. This suggests that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms on an aromatic ring tends to lower the property value.

2. **Phosphorothioate Group (P=S)**: The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group, P(=S)(OC)OC. In the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, the presence of a similar group contributes to a property value of 0.46153846153846156. This indicates that the phosphorothioate group can contribute to a moderate property value.

3. **Alkyl Chains**: The molecule has ethyl groups (CC) attached to the phosphorus atom. Alkyl chains generally increase the property value, as seen in examples like CCCCCC (1.0) and CCCCCC(C)O (1.0).

Considering these factors, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring suggests a lower property value, while the phosphorothioate group and alkyl chains suggest a moderate property value. Balancing these influences, the predicted property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be around 0.4.

The molecule in question, c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, contains a pyridine ring (an aromatic nitrogen-containing ring) and a hydrazide group (C(=O)NN). The presence of the pyridine ring suggests a potential for a property value of 0.0, as seen in other aromatic nitrogen-containing compounds in the examples. However, the hydrazide group might contribute to a non-zero value due to its potential reactivity or interaction.

Considering the examples and the structural features of the molecule, I would predict a property value of 0.0 for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1.

- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Several alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)

From the examples, molecules with sulfur-containing groups (e.g., CCS, CCBr) tend to have higher property values, often around 1.0. Molecules with amide linkages (e.g., CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C) have a property value of 0.8. The presence of a piperidine ring might contribute to a moderate property value, as seen in some cyclic structures.

Considering these factors, the molecule has a mix of features that could lead to a moderate to high property value.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 0.75
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbon-carbon triple bond (C#C). It resembles some of the other polycyclic structures in the examples, such as:

- CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C, which has a property value of 0.8095238095238095.
- CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 0.8421052631578947.

Both of these examples have multiple rings and carbonyl groups, similar to the molecule in question. The presence of the hydroxyl group and the alkyne (C#C) might slightly affect the property, but given the overall structural similarity to the examples with high property values, it is reasonable to predict a similar property value.

Therefore, I would predict the property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C to be approximately 0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C)
- An ester linkage (OC(=O))
- An amide linkage (NC(=O))
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: 0.25
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methylphenol, specifically para-cresol, which consists of a benzene ring with a methyl group and a hydroxyl group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with hydroxyl groups attached to aromatic rings, such as Oc1cccc(O)c1 and Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have a property value of 0.0. This suggests that the presence of a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring might contribute to a lower property value.

Additionally, the molecule CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, which is a similar structure with an additional alkyl group, has a property value of 0.4. The presence of the additional alkyl group might increase the property value compared to a simpler structure like Cc1cccc(C)c1O.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is likely to be lower than 0.4 but not necessarily 0.0, as the methyl group might contribute to a slight increase. A reasonable prediction, considering the trends, would be around 0.2.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.6
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the patterns from the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the degree of saturation and the presence of functional groups in the molecules.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, which is a small hydrocarbon with a double bond, indicating some degree of unsaturation. In the examples, molecules with higher degrees of saturation (like alkanes) tend to have higher property values, often close to or equal to 1.0. Molecules with unsaturation or functional groups tend to have lower values.

Given that CC=C(C)C is a small, unsaturated hydrocarbon, it is likely to have a property value lower than fully saturated hydrocarbons but higher than aromatic or highly functionalized compounds. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around 0.8, similar to other unsaturated hydrocarbons like CCCCCCCC=C, which has a property value of 0.8.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC=C(C)C is 0.8.

It also has several oxygen-containing functional groups, which are often associated with lower property values in the examples.

Based on the examples, molecules with complex structures and multiple oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have property values less than 1.0. For instance, molecules with multiple aromatic rings and oxygen functionalities, such as O=C1N(COC(=O)CCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3, have a property value of 0.25.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be around 0.25.

True Property: 0.625
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

- A thioether group (CS-)
- A pyrazole ring (1,2,4-triazole-like structure)
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- A tertiary butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

From the examples, molecules with heterocyclic rings, carbonyl groups, and alkyl chains tend to have property values that are not zero, often in the range of 0.2 to 0.7. For instance:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a property value of 0.7, which is a similar structure with a heterocyclic ring and a tertiary butyl group.
- CCCSC(=O)N(CC)C1CCCCC1 has a property value of 0.9090909090909091, which includes a thioether and carbonyl group.

Considering these structural similarities, the presence of a thioether, a heterocyclic ring, and a tertiary butyl group suggests a relatively high property value. However, the exact value can vary based on the specific interactions and electronic effects.

Based on the examples and structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be around 0.7.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.2222222222222222
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and structural features. For instance, molecules with long aliphatic chains or alcohol groups tend to have higher property values, while aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups or heteroatoms often have lower values.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate, which is an ester. Esters in the examples provided have varying property values, but they tend to be lower than those of long aliphatic chains or alcohols. For instance, the molecule CCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of 0.8571428571428571, while CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 has a value of 0.2.

Considering the structure of ethyl benzoate, which is an ester with an aromatic ring, it is likely to have a property value closer to the lower end of the spectrum for esters. Therefore, I would predict the property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 to be approximately 0.2.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 1.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the patterns in the given examples. The property values seem to be influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

In the examples, molecules with long carbon chains and simple functional groups like alcohols (e.g., CCCCCCCO) tend to have higher property values, often close to or equal to 1.0. Molecules with halogens like chlorine or bromine, especially when they are aromatic or have multiple halogens, tend to have lower property values, often 0.0.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a straight-chain alkane with a bromine atom at the end. This structure is similar to CCCCCCCO, which has a property value of 1.0. However, the presence of bromine, a halogen, might slightly reduce the property value compared to an alcohol.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be high, but slightly less than 1.0 due to the presence of bromine. A reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around 0.9.
