SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.7997173763824411
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the trends and patterns from the given examples. The molecule in question is a linear aliphatic ester, specifically a decanoate ester.

From the examples, we observe that:

1. Linear aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCCCCC, CCCCCCCC) tend to have positive or slightly negative property values.
2. The presence of an ester group (e.g., COC(=O)c1cccnc1, CCCCCCCC(=O)OC) tends to result in negative property values.
3. The length of the carbon chain and the presence of functional groups like esters influence the property value.

Given these observations, the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is similar to CCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which has a property value of -0.6336562. Since the molecule in question has a longer carbon chain, it might slightly affect the property value, but the presence of the ester group will still dominate the effect.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be slightly more negative than -0.6336562, due to the longer carbon chain. A predicted value could be around -0.65.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.7765331430215329
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a lactam (cyclic amide) structure. It resembles some of the other aromatic compounds in the examples, particularly those with chlorine substituents and heterocyclic structures.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values, especially when they are simple chlorinated benzenes (e.g., ClC=C, 1.53408133; ClCC, 1.45602592).
- More complex structures with additional functional groups, such as carbonyls or heteroatoms, tend to have negative property values (e.g., Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, 0.3529269; Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1, -0.74249499).

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 has both a chlorine atom and a lactam ring, which introduces a carbonyl group and a nitrogen atom into the aromatic system. This complexity suggests a property value that is likely negative, as seen in other complex aromatic systems with heteroatoms and carbonyl groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around -0.5. This value reflects the influence of the chlorine atom, the aromatic system, and the lactam structure, aligning with the trends observed in the provided examples.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.6110118315493149
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is a nitro compound, specifically 2-nitropropane. Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) are known to be electron-withdrawing due to the presence of highly electronegative oxygen atoms. This can influence the overall electronic properties of the molecule.

Looking at the examples, nitro-containing compounds such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO have a property value of -0.78265966. This suggests that the presence of a nitro group tends to result in a negative property value.

Considering the structural similarity and the influence of the nitro group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O would be around -0.75. This is consistent with the trend observed in the examples for nitro-containing compounds.

True Property: 3.6004907350194855
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as functional groups, molecular size, and overall molecular geometry. The given molecule, CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple rings and carbonyl groups.

From the examples provided, it seems that molecules with complex polycyclic structures and carbonyl groups tend to have property values that are positive and relatively high. For instance, the molecule CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C has a property value of 2.05240153, which is a similar type of structure with multiple rings and carbonyl groups.

Based on this analysis, I would predict that the property value for the given molecule, CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, is likely to be positive and in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately:

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 1.89150006568963
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A fluorinated benzene ring (Fc1cccc(F)c1), similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.59026493.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N), which is a common feature in several molecules with negative property values.
- A chlorinated benzene ring (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -0.60064327.

The presence of both electron-withdrawing groups (fluorine and chlorine) and the amide linkage suggests a tendency towards a negative property value. The examples with similar structural features, such as halogenated aromatic rings and amide groups, generally have negative property values.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be around -0.6. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is:

True Property: 0.241604076826863
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with a linear chain and a branching methyl group. 

Looking at the examples, we can find similar structures:
- CCCC(C)CO has a property value of 0.24160408.
- CCCCCO has a property value of 0.63982642.
- CCC1CCCO1 has a property value of 0.70233613.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is similar to CCCC(C)CO, but with an ether linkage instead of a hydroxyl group. The presence of the ether linkage might slightly decrease the property value compared to the alcohol, but it should still be in a similar range.

Considering these comparisons, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C would be around 0.2 to 0.3. Given the examples, a specific prediction could be:

0.24160408

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with two carbonyl groups and a bromine atom. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Alkyl Chain (CCC(C)-)**: The presence of an alkyl chain generally contributes to a slightly positive property value, as seen in examples like CCC(C)CC (0.70095768) and CC(C)CCO (0.63982642).

2. **Pyrrole Ring (n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O)**: Pyrrole rings can have varying effects depending on substitution. The presence of carbonyl groups and a bromine atom can influence the property value. For instance, the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of -0.63665506, indicating that the combination of a carbonyl and bromine can lead to a negative contribution.

3. **Overall Structure**: The combination of an alkyl chain with a substituted pyrrole ring containing electron-withdrawing groups (carbonyl and bromine) suggests a balance between positive and negative contributions.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures, the property value is likely to be slightly negative due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl and bromine groups, despite the presence of the alkyl chain.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O would be around -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size.

Biphenyl is a simple aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples provided, aromatic compounds with multiple rings or halogen substitutions tend to have higher property values, while simpler aromatic compounds or those with electron-withdrawing groups tend to have lower values.

For instance, the molecule Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34, which is similar to biphenyl but with an additional nitrogen atom, has a property value of -0.19288378. The molecule c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67, which is a larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a much higher property value of 1.47591668.

Given that biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic compound without additional functional groups or substitutions, its property value is likely to be closer to those of simpler aromatic compounds. Therefore, I would predict the property value for biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) to be around -0.2.

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.57789232112155
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of molecular structures with different functional groups and sizes, and their property values range from negative to positive.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a sulfur atom at the end. This structure is similar to simple alkanes, which tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative, as seen in examples like CCCCCCC(C)C (-0.04934264) and CCC1CCCCC1 (-0.00398813).

Considering the presence of sulfur, which is more electronegative than carbon and can introduce a slight polarity, the property value might be slightly more negative compared to a simple alkane of similar size. However, the effect is not expected to be very large.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be slightly negative, around -0.1. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCS is:

-0.1

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.09242436458961381
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with a tertiary carbon attached to an alcohol group. This structure is similar to the example CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O, which has a property value of -0.69296719. Both molecules have a tertiary alcohol group, which tends to decrease the property value due to the presence of the hydroxyl group and branching.

Considering the structural similarity and the influence of the alcohol group, the predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO would likely be in the same range as the example with the tertiary alcohol. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO is approximately -0.69.

This molecule is a naphthalene derivative with a methyl group attached, which is similar to the structure Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 with a known property value of -0.69262033.

Given the structural similarity, particularly the presence of the naphthalene core and a methyl group, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 will be very close to that of Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12. Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately -0.69262033.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic imide, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -0.80248104. The main difference in the structure is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) attached to the cyclic imide.

The addition of an alkyl chain generally increases hydrophobicity, which might slightly increase the property value compared to the example. However, the overall structure remains similar, and the property value is likely to remain in the same range.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be slightly higher than -0.80248104, but still negative. A predicted value could be around -0.75.

True Property: -0.5902649341327058
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have negative property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of -0.28584981, and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of -0.7887636. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group, which is highly electronegative, might further decrease the property value compared to a single halogen.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is likely to be negative and possibly more negative than the examples with single halogen substituents. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around -0.5 to -0.8. Given the examples and the electronegative nature of the trifluoromethyl group, a specific prediction could be:

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, tend to have negative property values. The example OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO has a property value of -0.80248103. The structure of OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is similar in that it also contains multiple hydroxyl groups, which contribute to its hydrophilic nature and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Given the similarity in structure and functional groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O will also be negative and close to that of the similar polyol example. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately -0.80.

2. **Functional Groups**: The presence of ketone groups (C=O) and an ester group (CC(=O)O) can influence the property value. The example CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O has a property value of -0.76049495, indicating that ketones can contribute to a lower property value.

3. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (C3(O) and C(O)) can also affect the property value. The example OCC3OC(OCC2OC(OC(C#N)c1ccccc1)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C(O)C3O has a high property value of 11.556946, but this is due to the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and a complex structure.

4. **Overall Complexity**: The complexity of the molecule, with its multiple rings and functional groups, suggests a higher property value compared to simpler structures.

Considering these factors and comparing with the examples, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is positive and relatively high due to its complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups. However, it is not expected to be as high as the most complex example provided (11.556946) due to the absence of certain features like cyano groups.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately:

The presence of the nitro group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, generally contributes to a more negative property value. The acetamide group (CC(=O)N) is also present, which can have a stabilizing effect but is less influential than the nitro group.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is likely to be in the negative range, similar to the other nitro-containing aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.65.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 2.9213366604504114
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

This molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with negative property values.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which can also contribute to a negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
- An alkene group (C=C) and an amine group (CCN), which are present in some examples with slightly positive or negative values.

Based on the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (-0.49988461) and Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O (2.10647693), tend to have negative or slightly positive values.
- The presence of a trifluoromethyl group, as seen in some examples, often contributes to a negative value.
- The combination of these groups suggests a negative property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative. A reasonable estimate, based on the trends observed, would be around -0.5.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.6411765694550122
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. It has a relatively simple structure with a small alkyl group (isopropyl) and a formate group. In the examples, similar small esters and alcohols tend to have property values around -0.1 to 0.6. For instance, CCC(C)(C)O has a property value of 0.63982642, and CC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of -0.09147695.

Given the structural similarity to CC(C)CCOC=O, which is also an ester with a small alkyl group, the property value for CC(C)OC=O is likely to be close to that of CC(C)CCOC=O.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O is approximately -0.09147695.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.2149775940324681
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is structurally similar to c1ccccc1O (phenol), which has a property value of 0.46269442. The presence of additional methyl groups, as seen in Cc1ccccc1C (toluene), which has a property value of -0.17573238, suggests that the methyl groups might slightly decrease the property value compared to phenol.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would likely be slightly lower than that of phenol due to the influence of the methyl groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be around 0.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is present in several examples with high property values, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl (4.70971259) and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl (7.88882119). These examples suggest that the presence of the phosphorothioate group contributes significantly to the property value.

Additionally, the molecule has a methoxy group (OC) and a thiomethyl group (SC) attached to a benzene ring. The presence of these groups can influence the property value, but the phosphorothioate group is likely the dominant factor.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of the phosphorothioate group, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be in the range of the higher values observed for similar structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately 4.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a chlorinated biphenyl, similar to some of the examples given.

The examples with high property values, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (4.40704128) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (6.60885901), are highly chlorinated aromatic compounds. The molecule in question is also a highly chlorinated aromatic compound, which suggests it might have a high property value.

Given the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is likely to be in the higher range. A reasonable prediction, considering the structure and the examples, would be around 4.0.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.6110118315493154
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a nitroalkane, specifically a nitropropane. 

From the examples, we can observe that nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to increase the property value, as seen in molecules like CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, which has a relatively high property value of 3.02137574. However, the presence of additional functional groups and the overall molecular structure also play significant roles.

In the case of CCCN(=O)=O, the molecule is relatively simple, with a single nitro group attached to a short alkane chain. Comparing it to other simple molecules, such as CCC, which has a property value of 2.30786246, and considering the effect of the nitro group, we can expect the property value to be somewhat lower than that of CCC due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group, which can reduce the overall property value.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 1.5.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.7940736305357269
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, which can be compared to similar structures in the examples.

1. **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: This is a chlorobenzene with a bromine substituent, and its property value is -0.78844464.
2. **COc1cccc(Cl)c1**: This is a methoxybenzene with a chlorine substituent, and its property value is -0.54674439.
3. **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: This is a dichlorobenzene, and its property value is 1.16468822.
4. **c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12**: This is a bromonaphthalene, and its property value is -0.70141182.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but with a fluorine atom instead of chlorine. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which could affect the property value. However, both are halogens, and their effects might be somewhat similar.

Given the examples, the property value for Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 is -0.78844464. Since fluorine is more electronegative, it might slightly increase the property value compared to chlorine. However, the overall effect might not be drastically different.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be slightly higher than -0.78844464, but still negative. A predicted value could be around -0.75.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with an additional methyl group and a hydroxyl group. This structure is similar to some of the cyclic and bicyclic compounds in the examples, such as CC1CCCO1 (0.70233613) and CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO (6.41130401), although the latter is much more complex.

Given the presence of the alcohol group, which can increase polarity, and the relatively simple bicyclic structure, the property value is likely to be positive but not as high as the more complex polycyclic structures. It is also likely to be higher than simple cyclic ethers like CC1CCCO1.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 would be around 0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC) and a cyclic imide structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O). This structure is somewhat similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 6.50677799. The main difference is the presence of a sulfur atom in the example, which is replaced by a nitrogen atom in the molecule we are analyzing.

Given the structural similarity, particularly the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the cyclic imide, we can expect the property value to be in a similar range, but likely slightly lower due to the absence of the sulfur atom, which might contribute to a higher property value in the example.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be slightly lower than 6.50677799. A predicted value could be around 6.0.

This molecule is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, specifically a methylated benzotriazole.

Looking at the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and nitrogen heterocycles, such as Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O (-0.04545818) and CNc1ccccc1 (0.1156889), tend to have property values around zero or slightly positive. The presence of a carbonyl group and a nitrogen heterocycle in the target molecule suggests it might have a similar property value to these examples.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around 0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which is a linear chain with a total of 9 carbon atoms.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCCC(=O)OC, which is a similar ester with a slightly shorter chain, has a property value of -0.7864571.
- CCOC(=O)N, another ester with a different functional group, has a property value of 0.61101183.
- CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2, a more complex ester, has a property value of 1.47414337.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is more similar to the first example, CCCCCC(=O)OC, due to its linear structure and ester functional group. Given that the chain is slightly longer, we might expect a similar or slightly more negative property value due to increased hydrophobicity and molecular size.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be slightly more negative than -0.7864571. A predicted value could be around -0.8.

- CCOC(=O)c1cncn1C(C)c2ccccc2 with a property value of -0.17308038. This is an ester with a pyrimidine and a benzene ring.
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 with a property value of -0.63541489. This is ethyl benzoate, an ester with a benzene ring.

The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is similar to ethyl benzoate but with a methyl group instead of an ethyl group. The property value for ethyl benzoate is -0.63541489. Given the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, the property value for methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1) is likely to be close to that of ethyl benzoate.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.63541489.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 1.319790503156186
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the overall molecular structure.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, making it a conjugated diene. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons and those with conjugated systems tend to have property values around or slightly above zero. For instance, the molecule C=Cc1ccccc1 (styrene) has a property value of 0.19068997, and CCC(C)(C)CC (a branched alkane) has a property value of 0.29371056.

Given that C=CCC=C is a simple conjugated diene without additional functional groups that might significantly alter its property value, it is reasonable to predict a property value close to zero, but slightly positive due to the conjugation.

Therefore, the predicted property value for C=CCC=C is approximately 0.2.

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.009513064365701365
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is a simple compound with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. This structure is similar to other halogenated compounds in the examples, such as FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br, which has a property value of -0.76478153. The presence of multiple halogen atoms, particularly bromine, tends to result in a negative property value, likely due to the high electronegativity and polarizability of bromine.

Considering the simplicity of BrC(Br)Br compared to more complex halogenated compounds in the examples, we can predict that its property value will also be negative, but possibly less negative than more complex structures with additional functional groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br is approximately -0.5.

- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 4.82182765.
- An amide linkage (N-C=O) within a cyclic structure, similar to the example CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O, which has a property value of -0.26270044.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is present in several examples with varying effects on the property value.

The presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a relatively high property value, as seen in the example with a similar group. The cyclic amide structure and the chlorinated carbon may moderate this effect, but the overall influence of the phosphorothioate group is likely to dominate.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is likely to be in the higher range, similar to the example with the phosphorothioate group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 4.8.

   - Molecules with amide groups, such as NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1 and CCC(=O)CC, tend to have negative or slightly positive property values.
   - Chloro-substituted aromatic rings, like Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2, often have negative property values.
   - Heterocyclic structures with nitrogen and oxygen, such as c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32, also show negative property values.

3. **Overall Prediction:**
   - Considering the combination of these structural features, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value.
   - The presence of the tert-butyl group might slightly increase the property value compared to similar structures without it.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C to be approximately -0.5.

- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 has a property value of -0.52928831.

The molecule in question has three chlorine atoms and an ether linkage between two aromatic rings, which could influence the property value. Given the trend of negative values for chlorinated aromatics and considering the additional ether linkage, we can predict a similar negative property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately -0.7.

In the examples, the molecule CC/C=C/C, which is also 2-butene but with a different stereochemistry (trans-2-butene), has a property value of 1.2454316. The stereochemistry of the double bond can influence the property value, but given the simplicity of the molecule and the lack of other functional groups or complex structures, the property value for CC/C=C\C (cis-2-butene) is likely to be very similar to that of CC/C=C/C.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C is approximately 1.2454316.

This molecule is a tertiary amide with two phenyl groups and a tert-butyl group. The presence of aromatic rings and the amide functional group suggests that it might have a property value similar to other aromatic amides in the examples.

Looking at the examples, the molecule CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 has a property value of 1.39971901. This molecule also contains an amide group and two phenyl rings, similar to the molecule in question.

Given the structural similarities, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be close to 1.39971901. However, the presence of the tert-butyl group might slightly alter the value.

- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents, such as Fc1cccc(Br)c1 (-0.79407363) and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.7887636), tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of an acetamide group, as seen in CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (-0.26988309), also contributes to a negative property value.

Considering these observations, the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to have a negative property value due to the combination of the polar acetamide group and the bromobenzene moiety.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be approximately -0.6.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples.

The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is isopropylbenzene, also known as cumene. It consists of an isopropyl group (CC(C)) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1). 

From the examples, we have:
- Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) with a property value of 0.1156889
- Cc1ccnc(C)c1 (a methylpyridine) with a property value of 0.1156889
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethylbenzene) with a property value of -0.17573238
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (a dimethylbenzene) with a property value of -0.42730229

The structure of cumene is most similar to ethylbenzene (CCc1ccc(C)cc1), which has a property value of -0.17573238. The addition of a methyl group to form an isopropyl group might slightly alter the property, but it is likely to remain in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 (cumene) would be around -0.17573238, possibly slightly more negative due to the additional methyl group. A specific predicted value could be approximately -0.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:

1. Molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro groups) tend to have negative property values.
2. Molecules with alkyl chains or electron-donating groups tend to have positive property values.
3. The presence of multiple halogens or nitro groups often results in higher negative values.

Benzaldehyde has an aromatic ring and an electron-withdrawing aldehyde group, which suggests a negative property value. Comparing it to similar structures in the examples, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (-0.47154028) and O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O (-0.77018241), we can infer that benzaldehyde's property value would be negative but not as negative as those with additional electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) would be around -0.3 to -0.5. Given the examples, a specific prediction could be:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with negative property values.
- An oxazole ring, which is a heterocyclic aromatic structure.
- An imide group (C(=O)N-C(=O)), which is also present in some examples with negative property values.

Based on the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values (e.g., Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2, -0.89203047).
- The presence of multiple electronegative atoms and conjugated systems often leads to negative property values.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is likely to be negative. A reasonable estimate, based on the trends observed, would be around -0.8.

True Property: -0.801786761686505
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings, such as biphenyl structures, tend to have negative property values. For instance, c1ccc2nc1ccccc2 (-0.80105465) and N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (-0.80248068) both have negative values.
- The presence of nitrogen in the aromatic system, as seen in N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, also results in a negative property value.

Given these observations, the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is expected to have a property value similar to other diaryl or polyaryl systems with nitrogen, which are generally negative.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be approximately -0.80, based on the trends observed in the examples.

True Property: -0.8024810385166457
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a relatively small and compact structure with two amide groups and a cyclohexane ring. In the examples, similar cyclic structures with amide groups, such as C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1, have a property value of -0.80096551. Another example, O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, has a property value of -0.48526707.

Considering the structural similarities, particularly the presence of amide groups and the cyclic nature, the property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be in a similar range. Given the compactness and lack of additional functional groups that might significantly alter the property, a reasonable prediction would be slightly closer to the more negative end of the range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately -0.65.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Clc1ccccc1Cl (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of -0.60064327.
2. Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (a more complex chlorinated aromatic compound) has a property value of 4.04108541.

The target molecule, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is less complex than the second example but more complex than the first, as it has three chlorine atoms and a biphenyl structure. The presence of additional chlorine atoms generally increases the property value compared to a single chlorinated benzene ring.

Considering these factors, the property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is likely to be higher than -0.60064327 but significantly lower than 4.04108541. A reasonable estimate, considering the pattern of increasing property values with additional chlorine atoms, would be around 1.5 to 2.0.

Therefore, a predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl could be approximately 1.8.

True Property: -0.4273022894216051
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

From the examples, we can observe that simple aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions tend to have property values around 0.1. For instance, Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) has a property value of 0.1156889, and CCc1ccccn1 (ethylpyridine) also has a property value of 0.1156889. These examples suggest that simple aromatic compounds with alkyl groups have property values slightly above zero.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a similar type of compound, we can predict that its property value will be close to these examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is approximately 0.1156889.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is a para-substituted aniline with a sulfonamide group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a nitro group instead of a sulfonamide. The property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is -0.48589979.

The sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group (N(=O)=O), which might result in a slightly less negative property value compared to the nitro-substituted aniline.

Considering these structural similarities and differences, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be slightly less negative than -0.48589979. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.45.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically triphenylene. It consists of four fused benzene rings, forming a planar, aromatic structure. In the examples, similar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as c1cccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54, have a property value of -1.144e-05. This suggests that the property value for triphenylene is likely to be in a similar range, as it shares the characteristic of being a polycyclic aromatic compound.

Therefore, based on the structural similarity to the example provided, the predicted property value for c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 is approximately -1.144e-05.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles a xanthene derivative with additional phenolic groups. The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and increased polarity, which could influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar aromatic and hydroxyl features, such as Oc1cccc(O)c1 (0.04476023) and Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 (2.22138904), show a range of property values. The presence of additional aromatic rings and functional groups in the molecule in question suggests a property value that might be higher than simple phenolic compounds but lower than highly substituted aromatic systems with strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 would be around 1.5. This value accounts for the increased complexity and potential interactions due to the multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings.

To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)O)
- An amide linkage (NC(C)=O)
- A thioether linkage (SC)

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl and CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, tend to have relatively high property values (2.36615835 and 3.98497409, respectively). The presence of chlorine atoms in the first example contributes to its higher value, while the second example has a complex structure with multiple functional groups.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is simpler than these examples, lacking additional aromatic rings or halogen atoms that could significantly increase the property value. However, the presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a property value higher than those of simple hydrocarbons or small polar molecules.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around 1.5 to 2.0. Given the simplicity compared to the examples with higher values, a specific prediction could be:

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.38266030028746817
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is a simple alkene with two chlorine atoms attached to the carbon-carbon double bond. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, tend to have higher property values. However, these examples also include aromatic systems, which can further influence the property.

Given that Cl\C=C/Cl is a small, non-aromatic molecule with two chlorine atoms, we can expect its property value to be positive but not as high as those of larger, more complex chlorinated aromatic compounds. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around 0.5.

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 0.9307551825202033
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and their properties. Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle similar to benzene but with a nitrogen atom replacing one of the carbon atoms in the ring. 

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23, have a property value of -0.80184859. Another example, CNc1ccccc1, which is aniline, has a property value of 0.1156889. Pyridine is less electron-rich than aniline due to the presence of the nitrogen atom, which is more electronegative than carbon and can withdraw electron density from the ring.

Considering these factors and the trend in the examples, pyridine is likely to have a property value that is negative, reflecting its electron-withdrawing nature compared to aniline. However, it is not as negative as some of the more complex heterocycles or those with multiple electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of pyridine (c1ccncc1) would be around -0.5. This value reflects its aromatic nature and the presence of the nitrogen atom, which affects its electronic properties.

2. A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1) which is common in many of the examples.
3. An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23) which is also present in some examples.
4. A chlorine atom attached to an aromatic ring, which is seen in several examples.

From the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and chlorine atoms tend to have negative property values. The presence of an ester and amide linkage also suggests a negative value, as seen in examples like CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2 (-0.52760342) and CC(OC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1)C#C (-0.52180088).

Considering these structural similarities and the trends in the examples, the predicted property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 is likely to be negative. A reasonable estimate, based on the examples, would be around -0.6.

From the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups, such as O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC, tend to have negative property values. The presence of a sulfonyl group, which is electron-withdrawing, might also contribute to a more negative property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is likely to be negative. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.5.

Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as functional groups, aromaticity, and overall molecular size and shape. The given molecule, COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C, contains several key features:

1. **Ester Groups**: The presence of ester groups (COC(=O)) can influence the polarity and solubility of the molecule.
2. **Aromatic Ring**: The molecule includes an aromatic ring, which can affect the electronic distribution and stability.
3. **Nitro Group**: The nitro group (N(=O)=O) is a strong electron-withdrawing group, impacting the molecule's electronic properties.
4. **Heterocyclic Ring**: The presence of a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen can also influence the electronic properties and reactivity.

Considering these features and comparing them to the examples provided, the molecule has similarities with other aromatic and nitro-containing compounds, which tend to have negative property values due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group and the presence of polar functional groups.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around -0.5.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a relatively small and rigid structure with two carbonyl groups and a secondary amine. In the examples, molecules with similar features, such as small cyclic structures with carbonyl groups, tend to have property values around the range of -0.5 to 0.5.

Considering the examples:
- C1CCCCC1 (cyclohexane) has a property value of 0.76476445.

- C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O (inositol) has a property value of -0.6349238.

The diketopiperazine structure is more similar to the inositol example in terms of having multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, but it is less polar and less complex. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict a property value closer to zero, but slightly negative due to the presence of carbonyl groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.2.

Considering these observations, the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a pyridine ring with a trichloromethyl group, which is similar to the structure of Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl. The presence of the nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring might slightly lower the property value compared to a purely carbon-based aromatic ring.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl would be around 3.5.

The molecule in question is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring, with a nitro group (NO2) also attached to the ring.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have negative property values. For instance, O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.77018241.
- Methoxy groups (OCH3) are electron-donating, which can slightly increase the property value compared to a simple nitrobenzene.

Considering these factors, the presence of both an electron-donating methoxy group and an electron-withdrawing nitro group suggests that the property value will be negative, but not as negative as a molecule with only nitro groups.

Based on this analysis and comparison with similar structures, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around -0.5.

True Property: 7.648170232486108
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 1.12334769. Both molecules are heavily chlorinated, which generally increases the property value due to the electron-withdrawing nature of chlorine atoms and the resulting increase in molecular weight and potential for polarizability.

Given the structural similarity and the high degree of chlorination, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl will be in a similar range, possibly slightly higher due to the additional complexity and number of chlorine atoms.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately 1.2.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.6411765694550127
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is a simple ester, specifically propyl formate. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Simple aliphatic hydrocarbons and small esters tend to have property values around 0 to 1.
- Molecules with more complex structures, especially those with multiple functional groups or aromatic rings, tend to have more extreme values, either positive or negative.

Given that CCCOC=O is a relatively simple molecule with an ester functional group, it is likely to have a property value similar to other small esters or simple aliphatic compounds. For example, CCC#C has a property value of 1.87387769, and CCCCCC#C has a property value of 0.04269239. 

Considering these examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be around 0.5. This value reflects its simplicity and the presence of an ester group, which might slightly increase the property value compared to a simple alkane. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC=O is approximately 0.5.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.7487837424710074
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a simple ester, specifically decyl acetate, which consists of a long alkyl chain (10 carbon atoms) and an ester functional group.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with long alkyl chains, such as CCCCCCCc1ccccc1, tend to have negative property values.
2. Esters, such as CCCOC, have positive property values.

Considering these observations, the presence of a long alkyl chain might contribute to a negative property value, while the ester group might contribute positively. The balance between these factors will determine the final property value.

Given the examples and the structure of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be slightly positive, as the ester group might have a more significant influence than the alkyl chain.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 0.1.

This molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O), which is often associated with negative property values in the examples.
- Two chlorine atoms, which are also present in several examples with negative property values.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is present in some examples with negative property values.
- Aromatic rings, which are common in both positive and negative property examples.

Given these structural features and their correlation with the examples, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for this molecule. The presence of the nitro group and chlorine atoms, in particular, suggests a more negative value.

Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be approximately -0.7.

Predicting the property value for the given molecule, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them with the examples provided. The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings, sulfur, and phosphorus atoms, as well as ester and ether linkages.

From the examples, molecules with complex aromatic systems and heteroatoms like sulfur and phosphorus tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of 4.82182765, which is relatively high due to the presence of phosphorus and sulfur.

Given the structural complexity and the presence of similar functional groups, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 is likely to be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 4.5.

True Property: -0.4998846138029685
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we have:
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1O, with a property value of -0.47154028, which is a benzamide with a hydroxyl group.
- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, with a property value of -0.47154028, which is a nitrobenzene with a methyl group.
- Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2, with a property value of 0.89203047, which is a more complex structure with nitro groups and chlorine substituents.

The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is similar to Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O in that both have a nitro group attached to a benzene ring, but instead of a methyl group, it has a hydroxyl group. The presence of the hydroxyl group, which is electron-donating, might slightly alter the property value compared to the nitrobenzene example.

Given the similarity to Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O and considering the electron-donating effect of the hydroxyl group, the property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is likely to be close to -0.47154028, but potentially slightly more negative due to the additional electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.47154028.

This molecule is a complex sugar, likely a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide, given its multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic acetal structures.

From the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic structures, such as sugars, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O has a property value of -0.6349238. Given the structural similarity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, the property value for the given molecule is likely to be negative and possibly more negative due to its larger size and increased number of hydroxyl groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately -0.7.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 1.8738776881488601
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne. It has a terminal alkyne group (C#C) and a relatively small carbon chain. In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules with similar functional groups tend to have property values closer to zero, often slightly negative or positive depending on the specific functional groups and their interactions.

For instance, CCC(C)C(=O)C has a property value of 0.29488765, and CC(C)OC=O has a property value of 0.64117657. These molecules have carbonyl groups, which can influence the property value. In contrast, simpler hydrocarbons like CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO have a property value of 0.47006061, which is positive due to the long carbon chain and the presence of an alcohol group.

Given that CCC#C is a small alkyne without additional functional groups that significantly alter the property, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero. Considering the examples and the nature of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around -0.1.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 4.82182765.
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of 4.40704128.

The presence of multiple chlorine atoms on an aromatic ring generally increases the property value, as seen in the examples. The phosphorothioate group also contributes to a higher property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be in the higher range, similar to the examples with multiple chlorine atoms and phosphorothioate groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately 4.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is a pyridine derivative with a carbonyl group (C=O) and a hydrazine group (NN) attached to the pyridine ring. This structure is somewhat similar to other nitrogen-containing heterocycles and carbonyl-containing compounds in the examples.

Looking at the examples, nitrogen-containing heterocycles like c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 have a property value of -0.80184859, and carbonyl-containing compounds like COc1ccc(C=O)cc1 have a property value of -0.45686229. The presence of the hydrazine group (NN) might introduce additional electron-withdrawing effects, similar to nitro groups, which tend to lower the property value.

Considering these factors, the property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is likely to be negative and in the range of other nitrogen-containing heterocycles and carbonyl compounds. A reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.6 to -0.7.

Therefore, the predicted property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is approximately -0.65.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, which has a property value of 0.67159776.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is present in several molecules with varying property values, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C (-0.0915631) and CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1 (0.0242187).
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1), which is a saturated heterocyclic amine, similar to the cyclic structures in some examples.

Considering these features, the molecule has a combination of polar functional groups (phosphorothioate and amide) and a non-polar cyclic amine. The presence of the phosphorothioate group, which tends to increase the property value, is balanced by the amide and cyclic amine, which may decrease it.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around 0.5. This value reflects the influence of the phosphorothioate group while accounting for the other structural elements.

True Property: -0.0493426426771376
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (octane), we can analyze the trends in the provided examples. The examples suggest that aliphatic hydrocarbons, particularly linear alkanes and alcohols, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the property value for CCCCCCCCO (octanol) is -0.09242436, and for CCCCCC (hexane), it is likely to be similar.

Given that octane is a linear alkane, we can expect its property value to be negative and similar to other linear alkanes. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (octane) would be approximately -0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group and an alkyne group. It shares some structural similarities with the following examples:

1. CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C, which has a property value of 2.78469004. This molecule is a polycyclic compound with a ketone and hydroxyl group.
2. CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO, which has a property value of 6.41130401. This is a complex polycyclic compound with multiple functional groups, including hydroxyl and ketone groups.

The presence of the hydroxyl group and the alkyne group in the target molecule may increase its property value compared to simpler polycyclic structures without these groups. However, the complexity and the specific arrangement of the rings and functional groups will also play a significant role.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is likely to be in the range of the more complex polycyclic structures with functional groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 3.5.

True Property: 26.13799590878186
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like the one you've provided involves considering various structural features and their potential influence on the property in question. The examples you've given suggest that the property might be related to some form of molecular interaction or reactivity, possibly solubility, electronic properties, or a similar characteristic.

The molecule you've provided, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups. This complexity suggests a high degree of molecular interaction potential, possibly leading to a significant property value.

Given the examples, molecules with extensive aromatic systems and multiple functional groups, especially those with oxygen-containing groups, tend to have higher property values. The presence of multiple methoxy groups, hydroxyl groups, and the polycyclic structure in your molecule suggests it might have a relatively high property value compared to simpler structures.

Based on the patterns observed in the examples, I would predict a positive property value for this molecule, likely in the range of 5 to 15. Considering the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, a reasonable estimate might be around 10.0. However, without specific context on what the property measures, this is a speculative prediction.

True Property: -0.3334473533330379
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to phenol (Oc1ccccc1) with a chlorine substituent. In the examples, we have:

- Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (a nitrophenol) with a property value of -0.49988461.
- Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) with a property value of 0.40613479.
- Clc1ccccc1I (iodobenzene) with a property value of -0.28584981.

The presence of a chlorine atom generally increases the property value compared to hydrogen, as seen in the examples with halogenated benzenes. However, the presence of an -OH group (as in phenol) tends to decrease the property value, as seen in the nitrophenol example.

Considering these factors, the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is likely to be slightly higher than that of phenol due to the presence of chlorine, but not as high as fluorobenzene or iodobenzene due to the -OH group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around -0.2.

The molecule contains:
- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C), which is a linear and polarizable group.
- An ester linkage (OC(=O)), which is polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.
- An amide group (NC(=O)), which is also polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1), which is similar to some of the chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, especially on aromatic rings, tend to have higher property values (e.g., Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl with a value of 6.60885901).
- Molecules with polar functional groups like esters and amides generally have negative property values unless they are part of a larger, more complex structure.

Considering these factors, the presence of the chloroalkyne and the chlorinated aromatic ring might increase the property value, while the ester and amide groups might decrease it. However, the overall structure is not as complex or heavily chlorinated as some of the high-value examples.

Based on this analysis, the predicted property value for ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 is likely to be slightly negative, but not as low as some of the simpler aromatic compounds with similar functional groups.

To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2) attached to the central carbon.
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have positive property values, especially when there are multiple halogens (e.g., Cl, Br).
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like Cl and aromatic systems can increase the property value.
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings like pyrimidine can also influence the property value, often making it more positive.

Considering these factors, the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl has multiple aromatic rings, two chlorine substituents, and a pyrimidine ring, which suggests a positive property value.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 2.5.

The structure of CCCCCOC=O is similar to CCCCC(=O)OCC, but with a slightly different arrangement of the ester group. Both molecules have a similar number of carbon atoms and functional groups, suggesting that their properties might be close.

Given this comparison, I would predict that the property value for CCCCCOC=O is likely to be close to that of CCCCC(=O)OCC. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be approximately -0.1.

To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we can look at the example provided for a similar molecule, ClCCCl, which has a property value of 0.32726077. The molecule ClCCl is a simpler structure, being dichloromethane, compared to ClCCCl, which is 1,2-dichloroethane. Given the trend that smaller, less complex molecules tend to have lower property values, we can predict that ClCCl will have a slightly lower property value than ClCCCl.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be slightly less than 0.32726077. A specific prediction could be around 0.25.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a simple aromatic compound with a hydroxyl group (phenol derivative) and two methyl groups attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that phenol derivatives tend to have negative property values. For instance, Oc1cccc(O)c1 has a property value of 0.04476023, and Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.49988461. The presence of additional electron-donating groups like methyl groups can slightly affect the property value, but the overall trend for phenol derivatives is towards negative values.

Considering the structure of Cc1cccc(C)c1O, which is similar to a methylated phenol, we can predict that its property value will also be negative, but not as negative as more complex or electron-withdrawing substituted phenols.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be around -0.6.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl, which is similar in structure to the chlorinated aromatic compounds provided in the examples.

From the examples, we observe that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have higher property values. For instance:
- Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 2.59231768.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 4.40704128.
- Brc1cc(Br)c(Br)cc1Br has a property value of 6.49600842.

The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl has four chlorine atoms, similar to the first example, but it is a biphenyl structure, which might increase the property value due to the extended conjugation and potential for higher molecular interactions.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl would likely be between the values for the first and second examples, but closer to the first due to the number of chlorine atoms. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 3.0.

True Property: 1.2454315975582577
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple hydrocarbon with a branched structure and a double bond. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons and alkenes tend to have negative property values, often around -0.3 to -0.5. For instance, the molecule CCCCC(CC)C=O has a property value of -0.32742758, and CCCCCCCCC=C has a value of -0.51596508.

Given the structural similarity of isoprene to these examples, particularly its small size and the presence of a double bond, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC=C(C)C will also be negative and within a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C is approximately -0.4.

To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The examples include a variety of organic molecules with different functional groups and structures, and their associated property values. 

The molecule ClCCl is dichloromethane, a simple chlorinated hydrocarbon. From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a very high property value of 9.19777087, and ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of 7.64817023. These are complex chlorinated aromatic compounds, but they suggest that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms contributes to higher property values.

However, simpler chlorinated compounds like ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl have a lower property value of -0.75889935. Given that ClCCl is a small, simple molecule with only two chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is lower than those of the more complex chlorinated compounds.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around -0.75.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.7644484919058492
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values. For instance, Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 has a property value of 2.06679222, and ClCC has a property value of 1.45602592. However, the presence of an -OH group, as in phenols, can influence the property value as well.

The example Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which is 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, has a property value of -0.76444849. This suggests that the presence of the hydroxyl group in a chlorinated aromatic ring can lead to a negative property value.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is likely to be similar to that of Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which is -0.76444849. Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is approximately -0.76444849.

True Property: 26.13799590878186
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known molecules.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as aromatic rings. The presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters, and phenols) suggests a potential for higher polarity and possibly a higher property value, similar to some of the more complex structures in the examples.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen atoms, which can contribute to higher property values due to increased interactions, a reasonable prediction would be to assign a property value that is relatively high, similar to other complex structures with multiple rings and oxygen functionalities.

Based on the examples provided, a predicted property value for this molecule could be around 5.0. This is an estimation considering the structural complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups that are known to influence the property values in the examples given.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.6342329771832531
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) atoms, along with the carbonyl group (C=O), suggests potential for polar interactions, which can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar heteroatoms and functional groups, such as CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C (0.09449317), show a slightly positive property value. The presence of a tert-butyl group, which is also present in the example, contributes to a similar steric and electronic environment.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is likely to be close to that of the example with a similar structure. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately:

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6354148911186104
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is an ester, specifically ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ethyl group (CCO) attached to a benzoate group (c1ccccc1C(=O)O).

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 with a property value of 8.02695293. This molecule is more complex due to the presence of additional functional groups like sulfonamide and a heterocyclic ring, which likely contribute to its high property value.
- CCCCCC(=O)OC with a property value of -0.36151285. This is a simple ester with a longer alkyl chain, but without the aromatic ring.
- CCCCC(=O)OCC with a property value of -0.36151285. This is another simple ester with a similar structure to the previous example.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is simpler than the first example but more complex than the last two due to the presence of the aromatic ring. The aromatic ring can influence the property value, potentially making it less negative or even slightly positive compared to the simple aliphatic esters.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be slightly less negative than the simple aliphatic esters, but not as high as the complex sulfonamide-containing molecule. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.2.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.8009355298421212
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, halogens, and the overall size and shape of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached. In the examples, linear alkyl chains like CCCCCCCCO have a property value of -0.09242436, and the presence of a halogen like bromine in Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of -0.70141182. The presence of bromine, a heavy halogen, might slightly decrease the property value compared to a similar alkane without a halogen.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be slightly negative, similar to other linear alkyl chains with halogens. A reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around -0.1.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 2.874654882061472
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide) based on the examples provided is challenging without knowing the specific property being measured. However, I can make an educated guess based on the general trends observed in the examples.

The examples include a variety of organic molecules with different functional groups, and the property values range from negative to positive. Simpler molecules or those with fewer functional groups tend to have lower or negative values, while more complex molecules with multiple functional groups or aromatic systems tend to have higher values.

Carbon monoxide is a simple diatomic molecule with no complex functional groups or aromatic systems. Based on the examples, simpler molecules like CCC (propane) have positive values, while others like ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(NC=O)N1C=CN(C=C1)C(NC=O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl have very high positive values due to their complexity.

Given that CO is a simple molecule, I would predict a property value closer to the lower end of the spectrum, likely negative or near zero. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for CO could be around -0.5 to 0.0. However, without knowing the specific property, this is a rough estimate.
