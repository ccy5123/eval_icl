The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with two carbonyl groups and a bromine atom. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Substituted Pyrrole Ring**: The presence of a pyrrole ring with carbonyl groups suggests some degree of electron delocalization and potential for hydrogen bonding, similar to other heterocyclic compounds in the examples.

2. **Bromine Substitution**: The presence of a bromine atom can influence the electronic properties of the molecule, potentially increasing its electron-withdrawing character.

3. **Alkyl Substitution**: The presence of an alkyl group (CCC(C)) can contribute to hydrophobic interactions and may affect the overall solubility and electronic properties.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with heterocyclic structures and electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., halogens, carbonyls) tend to have positive property values.

The molecule in question, c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, is biphenyl, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond.

In the examples, molecules with purely aromatic structures, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tend to have a property value of 0.0. For instance, the molecules Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 and c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 both have a property value of 0.0, and they are composed entirely of aromatic rings.

Given that biphenyl is also a purely aromatic compound without any additional functional groups that might alter the property value, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) is 0.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a cyclic compound with a diketopiperazine core, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of 0.78791796. The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the given molecule.

The addition of an alkyl chain generally increases hydrophobicity, which might slightly decrease the property value compared to the reference compound. However, the overall structure and functional groups remain similar, suggesting that the property value will not deviate significantly from the reference.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be slightly lower than 0.78791796, but still close to it. Therefore, a predicted property value could be approximately:

From the examples, we see that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a property value of 1.62534774. Given the structural similarity and the presence of similar functional groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O will be close to this value.

This molecule is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Presence of Ketone Groups**: The molecule contains ketone groups (C=O), which are common in several examples with negative property values, such as CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C (-0.54110894) and CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O (-1.52033108).

2. **Cyclic Structure**: The molecule has a polycyclic structure, similar to CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of -0.54110894.

3. **Presence of Ester Group**: The ester group (CC(=O)O) is present, which is also seen in CCOC(=O)C (-8.22430324), but the context and surrounding structure are different.

4. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (C3(O) and C(O)) can influence the property value, as seen in OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO (1.62534774), but the overall structure here is more complex and likely to have a different effect.

Considering these factors, the molecule's complex polycyclic structure with ketone and ester groups suggests a property value that is likely negative but not as extreme as some simpler structures with similar groups. The closest comparison in terms of complexity and functional groups is CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of -0.54110894.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately:

This structure is similar to the example O=N(=O)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.55820091. The presence of the nitro group (N(=O)=O) is a significant feature that influences the property value, as seen in the examples.

Additionally, the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which also contains a nitro group attached to a benzene ring, has a property value of -0.00733143. The presence of an acetyl group in the target molecule might slightly alter the property value compared to these examples, but the influence of the nitro group is likely to be dominant.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is likely to be close to the values of the examples with nitro groups on benzene rings. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately -0.5.

True Property: 0.05080301482612252
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)SC), which is not directly represented in the examples.
- A chloro-substituted aromatic ring, similar to some of the examples with chlorinated aromatic rings that have a property value of 0.0.
- An oxazole ring (n1c(=O)oc2), which is a heterocyclic structure.

The presence of a chloro-substituted aromatic ring often correlates with a property value of 0.0 in the examples. However, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the oxazole ring could influence the property value.

Considering the examples, the presence of heteroatoms and functional groups like nitro groups or cyano groups often results in non-zero property values, either positive or negative. The phosphorothioate group might contribute to a non-zero value, but without a direct comparison in the examples, it's challenging to determine the exact influence.

Given the complexity and the presence of both aromatic and heteroatom-containing groups, a reasonable prediction would be a small non-zero value, possibly slightly negative due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the chloro group and the potential influence of the phosphorothioate group.

Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.5, acknowledging the uncertainty due to the lack of direct analogs in the examples.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with aromatic rings, such as benzene derivatives, often have property values around 0.0 or slightly negative.
2. The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) and amide linkages (N-C=O) can influence the property value, often making it more negative.

In the examples, purely aromatic hydrocarbons such as biphenyl (c1ccc2ccccc2c1) and naphthalene (c1ccc2ccccc2c1) have a property value of 0.0. Given that triphenylene is also a purely aromatic hydrocarbon without any additional functional groups or heteroatoms, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would also be 0.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 is 0.0.

- Simple aromatic compounds like c1ccc2ccccc2c1 and c1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(cc2)c3ccccc3 have a property value of 0.0.
- Phenol (c1ccccc1O) has a property value of -1.85787415.
- Compounds with multiple hydroxyl groups, like OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have higher positive values (1.62534774).

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a methylphenol, which is less complex than the multi-hydroxylated compounds but more complex than simple aromatic hydrocarbons. It is also less polar than phenol due to the presence of methyl groups, which are electron-donating and can affect the overall property value.

Considering these factors, the property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is likely to be slightly higher than that of phenol but not as high as multi-hydroxylated compounds. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be around -1.0.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: -3.6763136467241426
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate groups in the molecules COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, all of which have a property value of -3.67631365. These molecules also contain halogenated aromatic rings, which contribute to their property values.

The target molecule has a similar phosphorothioate group and an aromatic ring, but instead of halogens, it has a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) on the aromatic ring. The presence of the thiomethyl group could potentially influence the property value, but given the strong influence of the phosphorothioate group observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be similar to those of the halogenated examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is approximately -3.67631365.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, especially those that are aromatic and heavily chlorinated, tend to have a property value of 0.0. For instance, the molecules "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" and "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" both have a property value of 0.0.

The molecule "Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl" is similar in structure, being an aromatic compound with multiple chlorine substituents. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that this molecule will also have a property value of 0.0.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.5582009080148314
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to the end. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Simple aliphatic chains like CCC (propane) have a property value of 0.0.
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, have positive property values, indicating that the presence of nitro groups tends to increase the property value.

Given that CCCN(=O)=O is a small molecule with a single nitro group, it is likely to have a property value that is slightly positive, but not as high as more complex aromatic nitro compounds. 

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 0.5.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -1.8578741455655363
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with a hydroxyl group attached, which is similar to a norbornane derivative.

Looking at the examples, we notice that molecules with similar bicyclic structures and alcohol groups, such as CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO, have positive property values. However, the complexity and additional functional groups in the examples with positive values are higher than in the target molecule.

The closest simpler structure with a tertiary alcohol group is CCC(C)(C)O, which has a property value of -1.85787415. Given the structural similarity and the presence of the alcohol group, the property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is likely to be negative, but not as low as the more complex structures.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 would be around -1.85787415, considering the influence of the tertiary alcohol group and the bicyclic structure.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.15025328245877984
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)
- An amide linkage (N2C(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)

Comparing this structure to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 0.15025328, we notice that both molecules share the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage to a phenyl ring. The main difference is the presence of a thioether linkage (SC(CCl)) in the example, which is absent in the molecule we are predicting.

Given the structural similarities and the absence of the thioether linkage, which might slightly affect the property, we can predict that the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O will be close to 0.15025328, but potentially slightly lower due to the absence of the thioether group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be approximately 0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule CNc1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.77370259. However, the presence of the carbonyl group and the nitrogen heterocycle in the target molecule could influence the property value.

Considering the examples, molecules with carbonyl groups and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values, often around -1.0 or lower. The presence of the nitrogen heterocycle might slightly increase the property value compared to a simple aromatic ketone.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around -1.0. However, given the specific examples and the structural features, a more precise prediction would be:

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -8.224303238586817
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is an ester, specifically an ethyl ester of heptanoic acid. 

From the examples, we notice that simple alkanes like CCCCC (pentane) and CCCCCCCCI (iodoheptane) have a property value of 0.0. However, esters such as CCOC(=O)OC (ethyl acetate) and CCCCCCCC(=O)OC (ethyl octanoate) have a property value of -8.22430324. This suggests that the presence of the ester functional group significantly influences the property value, likely due to its polar nature compared to non-polar alkanes.

Given that CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar in structure to CCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which has a property value of -8.22430324, it is reasonable to predict that CCCCCCC(=O)OCC will have a similar property value. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is:

From the examples, we can observe that esters tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 has a property value of -0.3270703, and CCOC(=O)c1cncn1C(C)c2ccccc2 has a property value of -0.48692877. Additionally, the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of -8.22430324, which is also an ester.

Given this pattern, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be similar to other esters. Therefore, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is -8.22430324.

Additionally, molecules with multiple halogen atoms, such as Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, also have a property value of 0.0.

BrC(Br)Br is a simple, non-aromatic molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon. Given the trend that simple halogenated structures tend to have a property value of 0.0, it is reasonable to predict that BrC(Br)Br will also have a property value of 0.0. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br is 0.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule "CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O", we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in "COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1" with a property value of -0.93657973.
- A thioester linkage (SC(CCl)), which is a feature that can contribute to the property value.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is present in several molecules with varying property values.
- A bicyclic structure with a lactam (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O), similar to the structure in "CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O" with a property value of -2.62742941.

Considering these features and the examples provided, the molecule has structural similarities to those with negative property values, particularly due to the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the bicyclic lactam structure. Therefore, the predicted property value for "CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O" is likely to be negative.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately -0.9.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Amide Group**: The molecule contains an amide group (C(=O)N), which is present in several examples. For instance, CN(C)C(=O)C has a property value of -1.87473772, and CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C has a value of -0.54110894. This suggests that the presence of an amide group tends to contribute to a negative property value.

2. **Aromatic Ring with Substituents**: The molecule has a chlorinated aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of -0.55820091. The presence of a chlorine substituent on an aromatic ring often contributes to a slightly negative property value.

3. **Heterocyclic Ring**: The molecule contains a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen atoms, similar to the structure in Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23, which has a property value of -2.39904629. Heterocyclic rings with nitrogen and oxygen can contribute to a more negative property value.

4. **Tert-butyl Group**: The presence of a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C) is a bulky substituent that can influence the property value. However, its effect is less clear from the examples provided.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C is likely to have a negative property value. The combination of the amide group, chlorinated aromatic ring, and heterocyclic ring suggests a property value in the range of -1.5 to -3.0.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately:

-2.5

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule "Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl", we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which can be broken down into two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with chlorine substituents on each ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example "Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl", which has a property value of -1.85787415. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms and the ether linkage suggests that the property value might be influenced by these features.

Given the examples, particularly the ones with multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings, it seems that the presence of chlorine tends to lower the property value, while the ether linkage might have a neutral or slightly positive effect. However, the overall pattern suggests that the presence of multiple chlorines and aromatic rings tends to result in a negative property value.

Therefore, based on the structural similarities and the trends observed in the examples, I would predict the property value for "Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl" to be approximately -1.85787415.

From the examples, we observe that small aliphatic compounds without significant functional groups or complex structures tend to have a property value of 0.0. For instance, molecules like CC#C, C, C1CCCCCC1, and CCC#C all have a property value of 0.0.

Given that CCCOCC is a small, simple aliphatic ether without any complex functional groups or aromatic rings, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be 0.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOCC is 0.0.

The molecule in question is a tertiary amide with two phenyl rings and a tert-butyl group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of -0.61247134. Both molecules contain a tertiary amide and two phenyl rings, although the example has an additional heterocyclic component.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of the tertiary amide and phenyl rings, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 will be in a similar range to the example with a value of -0.61247134.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-)
- A bromobenzene ring (c1ccc(Br)cc1)

From the examples:
- Molecules with acetamide groups, such as CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with bromobenzene rings, such as Fc1cccc(Br)c1, have a property value of 0.0.

Considering these observations, the presence of both an acetamide group and a bromobenzene ring suggests a balance between the negative influence of the acetamide and the neutral influence of the bromobenzene. However, the acetamide's influence might slightly dominate due to its polar nature.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to be slightly negative, but not as negative as some of the more polar or complex structures. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.5.

Looking at the examples, molecules with a benzene ring and simple alkyl groups, such as CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethylbenzene) and Cc1cccc2ccccc12 (naphthalene), have a property value of 0.0. This suggests that the presence of a benzene ring with alkyl substituents tends to result in a property value of 0.0.

Therefore, for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, I predict the property value to be 0.0.

Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -1.325819324949943
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that simple aromatic hydrocarbons like benzene derivatives (e.g., c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45) tend to have a property value of 0.0. However, when functional groups like nitro, carbonyl, or halogens are attached, the property value can vary significantly, often becoming positive or negative depending on the nature and position of the substituents.

In the case of benzaldehyde, the presence of the aldehyde group (a carbonyl group) is likely to influence the property value. Looking at similar structures, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (with a carbonyl and hydroxyl group) having a property value of 0.43495944, and considering the influence of the carbonyl group, we can infer that benzaldehyde might have a slightly positive property value due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) would be around 0.4.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and functional groups present in the molecule and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with negative property values.
- An oxazole ring, which is a heterocyclic aromatic structure.
- Amide groups (C(=O)N), which are also present in some examples with negative property values.

Based on the examples, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values. Additionally, the presence of heterocyclic structures and amide groups in the examples also correlates with negative values.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is likely to be negative. A reasonable estimate, based on the trends observed, would be around -0.7. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, which is similar to the example N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -3.58100994. The key structural feature in both molecules is the presence of two phenyl rings connected through a nitrogen-nitrogen linkage.

The example molecule N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 has a double bond between the nitrogen atoms, while the target molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 has a single bond. The presence of a single bond instead of a double bond might slightly affect the electronic properties, but the overall structural similarity suggests that the property value will be in a similar range.

Given this analysis, the predicted property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be close to -3.58100994. However, due to the single bond, it might be slightly less negative. A reasonable prediction would be around -3.5.

Another relevant example is O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, which has a property value of 0.78791796. This molecule is also a cyclic amide with additional alkyl groups.

Considering the structural similarities, particularly the presence of the cyclic amide structure, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be close to these examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately 0.78.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

In the examples, simple aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions tend to have property values around zero or slightly negative. For instance, the molecule Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) has a property value of -5.92406254, which is quite negative due to the presence of the amino group. However, simpler alkylbenzenes like CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 (dodecylbenzene) have a property value of 0.0, indicating that the presence of long alkyl chains or simple alkyl groups on benzene rings tends to result in property values close to zero.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a diethylbenzene, which is structurally similar to simple alkylbenzenes, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be close to zero. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is:

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O contains a nitro group (S(N)(=O)=O) attached to a benzene ring, similar to the example Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of 0.61976207. The presence of the sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) might have a similar electronic effect as the nitro group (N(=O)=O) in terms of electron-withdrawing properties.

Given the structural similarity and the presence of electron-withdrawing groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be close to that of Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O. Therefore, a predicted property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be approximately 0.62.

True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, the molecule "c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34" is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically a naphthalene-like structure with additional fused benzene rings, similar to the structure of pyrene. In the examples, similar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as "c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12" and "c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54", have a property value of 0.0. These structures are characterized by their stability and lack of polar functional groups, which often results in a neutral property value.

SMILES: Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3
True Property: 1.4217935089384213
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the structures in the examples, particularly those with multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups, such as Oc1cccc(O)c1, which has a property value of -0.77654681, and Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4, which has a property value of 0.547058.

Given the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and the overall aromatic structure, the property value is likely to be influenced by the electron-donating effects of the hydroxyl groups and the electron-withdrawing effect of the ketone group. The molecule's structure suggests it might have a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero, similar to the examples with similar functional groups and aromatic systems.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 would be around -0.5.

True Property: 0.1313266759425282
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl with a property value of -3.67631365.
- An amide linkage (NC(C)=O), which is present in several molecules with varying property values, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 with -2.8093902 and CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCCCC2 with 0.78791796.
- A thioether linkage (SC), which is not directly present in the examples but is part of the phosphorothioate group.

Considering the presence of the phosphorothioate group, which tends to have a negative impact on the property value, and the amide linkage, which can have varying effects, the property value is likely to be negative but not as low as -3.67631365 due to the absence of additional electron-withdrawing groups like chlorines.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around -2.5.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and structural features.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is a simple alkene with two chlorine atoms attached to the carbon-carbon double bond. In the examples, molecules with similar halogenated aromatic structures, such as Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, have a property value of -1.85787415. However, the structure Cl\C=C/Cl is not aromatic but rather a simple alkene with halogen substituents.

Considering the examples, simple aliphatic molecules with halogen substituents, such as CCBr, have a property value of 0.0. However, the presence of a double bond and two chlorine atoms might influence the property value differently.

Given the examples and the structural features of Cl\C=C/Cl, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -1.85787415, similar to other halogenated compounds, but slightly adjusted due to the non-aromatic nature and the presence of a double bond.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl is approximately -1.85787415.

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.8524219144999955
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle with a nitrogen atom in the ring, similar to some of the other nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds in the examples.

Looking at the examples, we see that:
- c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 has a property value of -5.05136163.
- CNc1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.77370259.
- CN2C(=O)CN=C(c1ccccc1)c3cc(ccc23)N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.80175647.

The molecule c1ccncc1 is simpler than these examples, being a basic aromatic ring with one nitrogen atom. The closest example in terms of structure is c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23, which is a more complex nitrogen-containing aromatic system with a very negative property value. However, simpler aromatic systems like CNc1ccccc1 have less negative values.

Considering the simplicity of pyridine compared to the more complex structures, and the fact that it is a basic aromatic heterocycle, a reasonable prediction would be a property value that is less negative than -5.05136163 but potentially more negative than -0.77370259, given the presence of the nitrogen atom.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccncc1 (pyridine) is approximately -1.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A benzene ring with a carbonyl group (similar to CC(=O)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of -1.32581932).
- An amide linkage (similar to O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, which has a property value of -0.71832042).
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (similar to Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, which has a property value of 0.0).
- An ether linkage and multiple hydroxyl groups (similar to OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, which has a property value of 1.62534774).

Considering these features, the molecule has a mix of polar and non-polar characteristics, with the potential for hydrogen bonding due to the hydroxyl groups and the amide linkage. The presence of the chlorinated aromatic ring may slightly reduce the overall polarity.

Given the examples, the molecule's property is likely to be influenced by the polar functional groups, but the aromatic and chlorinated components may moderate the overall value. Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 is likely to be slightly positive, but not as high as the highly polar sugar-like structures.

A reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately 0.5.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -1.8578741455655363
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that simple aliphatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives, such as CCCCCC (hexane) and similar structures, tend to have a property value of 0.0. 

The molecule CCCCCO (hexanol) is an aliphatic alcohol. In the examples, alcohols like OC1CCCCCCC1 have a property value of -1.85787415. However, this example is a cyclic alcohol, which might influence its property value differently compared to a linear alcohol like hexanol.

Considering the linear structure of CCCCCO and the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CCCCCO would be closer to 0.0, similar to other simple aliphatic compounds, but slightly negative due to the presence of the hydroxyl group, which introduces some polarity.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be around -1.85787415, similar to other alcohols in the examples. However, given the linear nature of hexanol, it might be slightly less negative, so a value around -1.0 could be a more accurate prediction.

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 0.7136250493237667
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is often associated with polar and electron-withdrawing characteristics.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which can also contribute to polarity and hydrogen bonding.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which is common in many of the examples and often associated with a property value of 0.0.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can contribute to polarity.

From the examples, molecules with significant polar or electron-withdrawing groups, such as sulfonyl or nitro groups, tend to have positive property values. For instance, molecules with nitro groups like CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O have a positive property value of 0.66799051. Similarly, molecules with amide linkages and aromatic rings, like O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC, have positive property values around 0.78791796.

Considering these factors, the presence of both a sulfonyl group and an amide linkage in the molecule suggests a positive property value. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be around 0.7. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

0.7

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several functional groups and structural features that can influence its property value:

1. **Ester Groups (COC(=O))**: The presence of ester groups is common in several molecules with varying property values. However, esters alone do not seem to have a consistent effect on the property value.

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The presence of a nitro group is significant. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative property values, such as -0.55820091 for Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O.

3. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: Aromatic rings are present in many examples, often associated with a property value of 0.0, but the presence of additional functional groups can alter this.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring (C1=C(C)NC)**: The presence of a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen can influence the property value, as seen in some examples with negative values.

5. **Overall Structure**: The molecule is relatively complex, with multiple functional groups and rings, which can lead to a more negative property value.

Considering these factors, particularly the presence of the nitro group and the heterocyclic ring, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a value around -0.5 to -1.0 seems plausible.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C is approximately:

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 0.7879179583692381
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two carbonyl groups (C=O) and two nitrogen atoms in a six-membered ring. This structure is somewhat similar to other cyclic or heterocyclic compounds in the examples, such as the diketopiperazine-like structures or other cyclic amides.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with similar cyclic amide structures, such as OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O, have property values around 0.37815558. However, this example also contains aromatic rings and a chlorine substituent, which can influence the property value.

Considering the lack of additional substituents or aromatic rings in O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, the property value might be closer to those of simpler cyclic structures or amides without additional functional groups. For instance, simpler cyclic structures like C1CCCCC1 have a property value of 0.0.

Taking into account the structural simplicity and the absence of additional functional groups that could significantly alter the property, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around 0.0. However, given the presence of carbonyl groups, which might slightly influence the property, a small positive or negative deviation could be expected.

Therefore, a predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 could be approximately 0.0.

SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some aspect of molecular stability, reactivity, or electronic properties. The examples with simple hydrocarbon chains or aromatic rings without additional functional groups tend to have a property value of 0.0. 

For the molecule ClCC, which is chloroethane, it is a simple alkyl halide. The examples with halogenated aromatic compounds like Clc1ccccc1 and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl have a property value of 0.0. However, the presence of a halogen in a small alkane might slightly affect the property value compared to a pure hydrocarbon.

Considering the examples and the nature of ClCC, I would predict a property value close to 0.0, but slightly negative due to the presence of the chlorine atom, which might introduce a small electronic effect. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be:

-0.1

To predict the property value for the molecule "Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl", we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a pyridine ring (a benzene ring with one nitrogen atom) and a trichloromethyl group attached. In the examples, several chlorinated aromatic compounds and those with trichloromethyl groups have a property value of 0.0. For instance:

- "Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2" has a property value of 0.0.
- "ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C4(Cl)C5(Cl)C1(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl" has a property value of 0.0.
- "Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl" has a property value of 0.0.
- "Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2" has a property value of 0.0.

These examples suggest that chlorinated aromatic compounds, especially those with multiple chlorine atoms, tend to have a property value of 0.0. The presence of a pyridine ring instead of a benzene ring does not significantly alter this trend, as seen in the example "O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12" with a property value of -0.55820091, which is close to 0.0.

Therefore, based on the structural similarity to the examples provided, the predicted property value for "Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl" is likely to be 0.0.

In the examples, simple alcohols like CCC(CC)CO and CCCC(O)CCC have a property value of -1.85787415. Given the structural similarity of CCCCC(C)O to these molecules, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CCCCC(C)O would also be -1.85787415.

This is similar to other halogenated aromatic compounds in the examples, such as ClCCl, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl, and ClC(Cl)Cl, all of which have a property value of 0.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is 0.0.

The examples with similar structures, such as Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl and c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45, have a property value of 0.0. These compounds are highly chlorinated and aromatic, which seems to correlate with a property value of 0.0 in the given examples.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1

This molecule contains a phosphoric acid ester group (P(=O)(O)(O)) attached to aromatic rings. The presence of aromatic rings and the phosphoric acid ester group suggests that the molecule might have a property value similar to other aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (such as nitro, carbonyl, or halogens) tend to have negative property values. For instance:

- Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1 has a property value of -1.84786621.
- CN(C)C(=S)SSC(=S)N(C)C has a property value of -0.35784602.
- Nc1ccccc1O has a property value of -0.34463723.

Considering the structure of the given molecule and the trends observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be slightly negative due to the presence of the phosphoric acid ester group and the aromatic rings.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3) attached to a phenyl ring, which is a common feature in many molecules and can influence properties like lipophilicity and electronic effects.
- A ketone group (C=O) within a piperidine ring, which can affect the molecule's polarity and reactivity.
- Chlorine atoms, which are present in several of the example molecules, often associated with a range of property values.

From the examples:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents, such as Cl or F, often have property values around 0.0 or slightly negative.
- The presence of a ketone group in a cyclic structure, as seen in some examples, can lead to positive property values, especially when combined with other electron-withdrawing groups.

Considering these factors, the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O has structural similarities to molecules with both positive and negative property values. However, the combination of the trifluoromethyl group and the ketone in a cyclic structure suggests a potential for a positive property value, as seen in some examples with similar features.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be slightly positive, around 0.5.

True Property: -0.007331432915424354
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring, with a nitro group (NO2) also attached to the ring.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, have a property value of 1.04384445.
- Aromatic compounds with methoxy groups, such as CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2, have a property value of -0.68149257.

The presence of both a methoxy group and a nitro group on the benzene ring suggests that the property value might be influenced by both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, while the methoxy group is an electron-donating group.

Considering the examples and the nature of the substituents, the property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is likely to be positive, but not as high as the example with two nitro groups. A reasonable prediction, taking into account the balance of these effects, would be around 0.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is approximately 0.5.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated polycyclic compound. From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as ClCCCl and ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, have a property value of 0.0.
2. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms tends to result in a property value of 0.0, especially when the structure is saturated or polycyclic.

Given the high degree of chlorination and the polycyclic nature of the molecule, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be similar to those of other highly chlorinated compounds in the examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is 0.0.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -8.224303238586817
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is a simple ester, specifically propyl formate.

Looking at the examples, simple aliphatic hydrocarbons and small molecules with no significant functional groups tend to have a property value of 0.0. For instance, molecules like C1CCCCCC1, CCC#C, and CCCCCCC#C all have a property value of 0.0. 

The presence of an ester functional group (COC=O) in CCCOC=O is similar to the structure of CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O, which has a property value of 1.53823784, but this molecule is more complex and contains additional functional groups that likely contribute to its higher property value.

Given the simplicity of CCCOC=O and its lack of additional complex functional groups or aromatic systems, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be closer to those of simple aliphatic compounds. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC=O is:

0.0

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a simple ester, specifically decyl acetate, which consists of a long alkyl chain (10 carbon atoms) and an ester functional group.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with long alkyl chains and simple structures, such as CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 and CCC1CCCCC1, tend to have property values around 0.0.
- Esters, such as CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C, have a property value of 0.59448869, but this example is more complex than a simple ester.

Given that CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is a simple ester with a long alkyl chain, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be close to 0.0, similar to other long-chain hydrocarbons and simple structures.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 0.0.

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with phenol groups, such as Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1, tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, also have negative property values.
- The presence of chlorine atoms in aromatic rings, as seen in Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, tends to result in more negative property values.

Considering these observations, the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O is likely to have a negative property value due to the combination of phenol, nitro, and chlorine-substituted aromatic rings.

Based on the trends from the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately -1.5.

True Property: 0.1304595989855115
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O) attached to aromatic rings. In the examples, the presence of phosphorothioate groups, as seen in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, is associated with a negative property value of -0.93657973. Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings with substituents like -O- and -S- can influence the property value.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of the phosphorothioate groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 will also be negative, likely in a similar range to the example with a phosphorothioate group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately -0.93657973.

True Property: 0.43666213387638636
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) and a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can see that molecules with nitro groups attached to aromatic rings, such as Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.55820091. Additionally, the presence of a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, as seen in Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, has a property value of -1.85787415.

Considering the influence of both the nitro and hydroxyl groups on the aromatic ring, the property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is likely to be similar to that of other nitroaromatic compounds. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be approximately -0.55820091.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O

This molecule is a complex carbohydrate, likely a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide, given the repeating sugar units and multiple hydroxyl groups. In the examples provided, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and sugar-like structures tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, which is a sugar-like structure, has a property value of 1.12275518.

Considering the structural similarity to sugar molecules and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be positive and similar to the sugar-like example. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately:

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne with a terminal triple bond, also known as 1-butyne.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Linear alkanes and alkenes, such as CCCCCCCCCC=O and CCCCCCCCCCCCCC, tend to have negative property values, often around -1.85787415.
- Molecules with triple bonds, such as N#Cc1ccccc1C#N, have a property value of -0.26328849.

Considering the structure of CCC#C, it is a small, linear alkyne. The presence of the triple bond might suggest a property value closer to that of N#Cc1ccccc1C#N, but the overall size and linearity of the molecule might also influence the property value to be more negative, similar to linear alkanes.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around -0.5. However, given the trend of linear molecules having more negative values, a slightly more negative value might be appropriate. Therefore, a predicted property value for CCC#C could be approximately -0.6.

True Property: -1.532892838228519
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -0.93657973.
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 0.0.

Considering these structural similarities, particularly the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the chlorinated aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be influenced by the electron-withdrawing effects of the chlorine atoms and the phosphorothioate group.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl would be approximately -0.93657973, similar to the molecule with a comparable phosphorothioate group and chlorinated aromatic ring.

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 0.5854465158978687
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 contains a pyridine ring (c1nccc1) with a carbonyl group (C=O) and a hydrazine moiety (NN) attached. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2, which has a property value of 1.31151231. Both molecules contain nitrogen heterocycles and carbonyl groups, which may contribute to similar electronic properties.

Given the structural similarities and the presence of functional groups that can influence the property value, I would predict that the property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is likely to be in a similar range to the example with a value of 1.31151231. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be approximately:

True Property: -0.93657972845172
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Several alkyl chains

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, have a positive property value (0.66799051).
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, tend to have negative property values (-2.86764415).
- Molecules with piperidine rings, such as Cn2c(=O)n(C)c1ncn(CC(O)CO)c1c2=O, have positive property values (1.3422848).

Considering these observations, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the piperidine ring suggests a positive contribution to the property value, while the amide linkage might contribute negatively. However, the overall structure, with multiple alkyl chains and the specific combination of functional groups, suggests a balance that leans towards a slightly positive property value.

Therefore, based on the structural analysis and comparison with the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around 0.5.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property value is influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule. Linear alkanes, such as "CCCCCCCO" and "CCCC/C=C/C", have a property value of 0.0. The molecule "CCCCCCCC" is a linear alkane (octane) with no functional groups or aromatic rings that might influence the property value differently.

Therefore, the predicted property value for "CCCCCCCC" is 0.0.

Predicting the property value for a molecule based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples. The molecule in question, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, has a complex structure with multiple rings, a hydroxyl group, and an alkyne group.

From the examples provided, molecules with multiple rings and oxygen-containing functional groups (like carbonyls and hydroxyls) tend to have positive property values, especially when they are part of a larger, complex structure. For instance, the molecule CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO has a property value of 1.21203054, and it shares some structural similarities with the molecule in question, such as the presence of multiple rings and oxygen functionalities.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is likely to be positive and in a similar range to the complex, oxygen-containing structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 1.0.

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings. The presence of methoxy groups (OC) and hydroxyl groups (O) suggests some degree of polarity, but the overall structure is quite large and complex.

From the examples provided, it seems that molecules with large, complex, and polycyclic structures, especially those with multiple aromatic rings and ether linkages, tend to have property values closer to zero. For instance, the molecule C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21 has a property value of -0.94468212, and it is a large polycyclic structure with several ether linkages.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple aromatic and ether groups in the target molecule, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be close to zero, possibly slightly negative due to the presence of polar groups.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the given molecule is approximately:

-0.5

True Property: -1.8578741455655363
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the presence of certain functional groups and structural features can influence the property value.

- The molecule Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.43666213, indicating that the presence of a nitro group on a phenol ring contributes positively to the property value.
- The molecule Fc1ccccc1 has a property value of 0.0, suggesting that a fluorine atom on a benzene ring does not significantly affect the property value.
- The molecule Clc1ccccc1I has a property value of 0.0, indicating that a chlorine atom on a benzene ring does not significantly affect the property value.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to the phenol structure in Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O but with a chlorine substituent instead of a nitro group. Based on the examples, the presence of a chlorine atom on a benzene ring tends to result in a property value of 0.0, as seen in Clc1ccccc1I and Fc1ccccc1.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is 0.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A chloro-substituted aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl, both of which have a property value of 0.0.
- An amide linkage (OC(=O)N), which is present in several molecules with varying property values, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1 (-2.8093902) and CCC(C)C1(CC(Br)=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O (0.78791796).
- An alkyne group (C#C), which is not explicitly present in the examples, but the presence of unsaturation is common in several molecules with both positive and negative property values.

Considering these structural features and the examples, the presence of the chloro-substituted aromatic ring suggests a property value close to 0.0. However, the presence of the amide linkage and the alkyne group could influence the property value slightly.

Taking into account the balance of these features, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be slightly negative, but close to zero. Therefore, a predicted property value could be:

-0.1

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: -0.3598915865804391
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2) attached to the central carbon.
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with phenyl rings and halogen substituents (e.g., Cl, Br) often have a property value of 0.0, especially when they are simple aromatic compounds without additional functional groups that significantly alter the electronic distribution.
- The presence of heterocycles like pyrimidine can influence the property value, as seen in examples with nitrogen-containing rings.
- The presence of a phenol group (as in Oc1ccc(O)cc1) tends to result in a negative property value, likely due to the electron-donating nature of the hydroxyl group.

Considering these observations, the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl has a combination of features that could lead to a property value influenced by both the electron-donating hydroxyl group and the electron-withdrawing chlorine atoms. The presence of the pyrimidine ring may also contribute to a more negative value compared to simple aromatic compounds.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the phenol group and the pyrimidine ring. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately -0.5.

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -8.224303238586817
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCOC=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCOC=O is a linear chain with an ester functional group (OC=O) at the end. 

Looking at the examples, we see that linear aliphatic chains with simple functional groups tend to have negative property values. For instance:
- CCCCCCC=O has a property value of -1.32581932.
- CCCCCCCCC(=O)C also has a property value of -1.32581932.
- CCCC(=O)OCC has a property value of -8.22430324, which is significantly lower due to the presence of the ester group.

Given that CCCCCOC=O is similar to CCCCCCC=O but with an ester group, we can expect the property value to be negative, likely more negative than -1.32581932 due to the ester group, but not as negative as -8.22430324 because the chain is shorter.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be around -2.0.

These compounds are fully chlorinated biphenyls, which seem to consistently have a property value of 0.0 in the given dataset.

For instance, molecules like CCC(C)C, CCCCCCCC=C, and Cc1ccccc1C all have a property value of 0.0.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is a simple alkene, specifically 2-methyl-1-butene. Based on the pattern observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that this molecule will also have a property value of 0.0.

- The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) in a chlorinated aromatic ring, as seen in Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, also corresponds to a property value of -1.85787415.

Given these observations, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is also -1.85787415.

Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and hydroxyl groups, as well as a lactone moiety. The presence of these functional groups and the overall complexity suggest that the molecule might have a relatively high property value, similar to other complex structures with multiple oxygen-containing functional groups.

Based on the examples provided, particularly those with high property values such as OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O (2.30763035) and other complex polycyclic structures, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for this molecule would also be relatively high.

Therefore, I would predict the property value for COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 to be approximately 2.0.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.7494595971918068
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of the thiosemicarbazide moiety suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and polar interactions, which could influence the property value. The tert-butyl group is a bulky, non-polar group that might reduce the overall polarity of the molecule.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar functional groups or structural features can provide insight. For instance, CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a property value of 0.63148265, and it contains a similar heterocyclic structure with a tert-butyl group. This suggests that the presence of the tert-butyl group and the heterocyclic structure might contribute to a positive property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to the example with a similar structure. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately 0.63.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -8.224303238586817
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is an ethyl benzoate, which is an ester formed from benzoic acid and ethanol.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 with a property value of 1.70770569. This molecule is more complex due to the additional sulfonamide and other functional groups.
- CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O with a property value of -1.52033108. This is a diketone with a benzene ring, which is somewhat similar in terms of aromaticity but has different functional groups.
- CCCCC(=O)OCC with a property value of -8.22430324. This is a simple ester with a long alkyl chain, showing a very negative property value.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is simpler than the first example and lacks the additional functional groups that contribute to a higher property value. It is more similar to the second example in terms of having a benzene ring and a carbonyl group, but it is an ester rather than a diketone. The third example shows that simple esters with long alkyl chains have very negative values, but the presence of the aromatic ring in CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 should moderate this effect.

Considering these comparisons, the property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is likely to be negative but not as extreme as the long-chain ester. A reasonable prediction, given the balance of aromaticity and ester functionality, would be around -1.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -1.5.

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

In the given examples, simple aliphatic chains like CCCCCCCCO have a property value of -1.85787415, while aromatic compounds or those with more complex functional groups tend to have different values. The presence of a bromine atom (Br) in the molecule CCCCCCCBr is similar to the example Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which has a property value of 0.0. However, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is an aromatic compound, while CCCCCCCBr is an aliphatic chain with a bromine atom.

Considering the aliphatic nature of CCCCCCCBr and the presence of a bromine atom, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be similar to other aliphatic chains, but slightly adjusted due to the presence of bromine. The closest example is CCCCCCCCO, which has a property value of -1.85787415. The presence of bromine, which is less polar than an alcohol group, might slightly increase the property value compared to the alcohol.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be slightly higher than -1.85787415, but still negative due to the aliphatic nature of the molecule. A predicted value could be around -1.5.

Carbon monoxide is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is quite different from the more complex organic molecules listed, many of which have property values of 0.0, especially for simple hydrocarbons or small molecules like CC (ethane), CCC (propane), and CC#C (propyne).

Given the simplicity and small size of CO, and considering that similar small and simple molecules in the list have a property value of 0.0, it is reasonable to predict that CO would also have a property value of 0.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CO is 0.0.
