True Property: -0.37512722900343315
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure, specifically a chlorinated benzoxazole. The presence of chlorine atoms and a heterocyclic ring with an oxygen and nitrogen atom suggests that the molecule might have a negative property value, as seen in several examples with similar features.

For instance, the molecule "Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1" has a property value of -0.98782762, and "COc2c1occc1c(OC)c3c(=O)cc(C)oc23" has a property value of -0.99945608. Both of these molecules contain chlorine atoms and heterocyclic structures, which contribute to their negative property values.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is likely to be negative and close to the values of similar structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately -0.98782762.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.05839719298699099
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an isopropyl group (CC(C)). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have a positive property value (0.84902779). This suggests that the presence of a nitro group might contribute to a positive property value.

Additionally, the examples show that small aliphatic chains or simple structures tend to have property values closer to zero or slightly positive. For instance, CCCCCl has a property value of -0.94664082, and CCC(C)CC has a property value of 0.59352098.

Considering these observations, the presence of the nitro group in CC(C)N(=O)=O is likely to contribute positively to the property value, but the overall small size and simplicity of the molecule might moderate this effect.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O would be slightly positive, around 0.8, similar to the example with a nitro group. Thus, the predicted property value is:

0.84902779

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule consists of:
- A benzene ring with two fluorine atoms (Fc1cccc(F)c1).
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N).
- Another benzene ring with a chlorine atom (c2ccc(Cl)cc2).

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with halogen substitutions on benzene rings, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, have a property value of 0.33794121.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1cccnc1, have a property value of 0.77682276.
- Molecules with multiple halogen substitutions, such as Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, have a property value of 0.81846586.

The molecule in question has both fluorine and chlorine substitutions, as well as an amide linkage. The presence of multiple halogens and the amide group suggests a property value that is likely influenced by both the electron-withdrawing effects of the halogens and the polar nature of the amide group.

Considering these factors, the property value is likely to be positive and closer to the higher end of the range observed for similar structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be approximately 0.8.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with a linear chain and a branching methyl group. It resembles the structure of other aliphatic compounds with oxygen, such as alcohols and ethers, which generally have positive property values in the examples provided.

For instance, the molecule CCCCCCO (hexanol) has a property value of 0.78159195, and CCCCO (butanol) also has a similar positive property value. These examples suggest that the presence of an ether group and a linear/branched alkyl chain tends to result in a positive property value.

Given this analysis, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is likely to be positive and similar to those of other simple ethers and alcohols. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C is approximately 0.78159195.

True Property: 0.5560523489489062
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Alkyl Chain**: The molecule has a propyl group (CCC(C)) attached to the pyrrole ring. Alkyl chains generally contribute to a positive property value, as seen in examples like CCC(C)CC (0.59352098) and C1CCCCC1 (0.59352098).

2. **Pyrrole Ring**: The presence of a pyrrole ring, especially with carbonyl groups, can influence the property value. In the example Nc1nccs1 (-0.20077471), the presence of a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen contributes to a negative value.

3. **Carbonyl Groups**: The molecule has two carbonyl groups (C=O), which can contribute to a negative property value due to their electron-withdrawing nature. This is seen in examples like O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC (0.80704534) and O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)CC=C (-0.56211215).

4. **Bromine Atom**: The presence of a bromine atom can also influence the property value. In the example CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (0.61664926), the bromine contributes to a positive value, but in combination with other groups, it can vary.

Considering these factors, the molecule has both positive and negative influences. The alkyl chain and bromine might push the value towards positive, while the pyrrole ring and carbonyl groups might push it towards negative. Balancing these influences, the property value is likely to be slightly negative.

Based on the analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O is approximately -0.300.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

Biphenyl is a simple aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples, aromatic hydrocarbons and similar structures tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O has a property value of -0.98682997, and c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 has a property value of -0.98299734. These examples suggest that aromatic systems often have negative property values.

Considering the structure of biphenyl and the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) will also be negative. Given the simplicity of biphenyl compared to more complex aromatic systems in the examples, the property value might not be as negative as those with additional functional groups or extended conjugation.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl is around -0.5.

In the examples, linear alkanes such as CCCCCCC=C and CCCCCCC(C)C have property values of -0.16694133 and 0.59352098, respectively. The presence of a sulfur atom in CCCCCS might influence the property value, but it is still a relatively simple structure compared to more complex aromatic or heterocyclic compounds.

Considering the examples and the nature of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be close to the values of similar linear alkanes. Given the presence of sulfur, which might slightly decrease the property value compared to a pure alkane, a predicted property value for CCCCCS could be around 0.1.

Looking at the examples:
- CCC(C)(C)C has a property value of 0.59352098.
- CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O has a property value of 0.78159195.
- CCCCCOC has a property value of 0.78159195.

The presence of the alcohol group (O) in the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO suggests it might have a property value similar to other alcohols or ethers in the examples. The examples with alcohol or ether groups tend to have higher property values, often around 0.78.

Therefore, based on the similarity to these examples, the predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is approximately 0.78159195.

True Property: -0.5621121452182994
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a cyclic compound with a urea-like structure (a diketopiperazine) and an alkyl side chain. The closest example in the list is O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -0.56211215. The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of an additional alkyl group (C(C)CCC) in the side chain of the target molecule.

The addition of an alkyl group generally increases hydrophobicity, which can affect the property value. However, the core structure remains the same, and the examples suggest that the property values for similar structures are not drastically different.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is likely to be slightly more negative than -0.56211215 due to the increased hydrophobicity from the additional alkyl group. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.600.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6384198863449453
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group is a significant electron-withdrawing group due to the high electronegativity of fluorine atoms.

Looking at the examples, molecules with electron-withdrawing groups such as halogens (e.g., Cl, Br, I) or carbonyl groups tend to have negative property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of -0.99182725, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -0.78733232. These examples suggest that the presence of electron-withdrawing groups contributes to a negative property value.

Given that trifluoromethyl is a strong electron-withdrawing group, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 will also be negative. Based on the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of trifluoromethylbenzene would be around -0.8 to -1.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.9.

For instance, the molecule OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO has a property value of 0.00615353. This molecule is similar to the one in question, as both are polyols with multiple hydroxyl groups.

Given the structural similarity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O will also be close to zero. Therefore, a predicted property value for this molecule would be approximately:

CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C

This molecule is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Presence of Ketone Groups**: The molecule contains multiple ketone groups (C=O), which are polar and can influence the property value. In the examples, molecules with ketone groups tend to have negative property values.

2. **Cyclic Structure**: The molecule has a polycyclic structure, similar to some of the examples. For instance, CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C has a property value of -0.95739809, which is quite negative.

3. **Presence of Ester Group**: The ester group (CC(=O)O) is also present, which can contribute to a more negative property value due to its polar nature.

4. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (C3(O) and C(O)) can also affect the property value, potentially making it more negative due to increased polarity.

Considering these structural features and comparing them with the examples, particularly those with similar functional groups and cyclic structures, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for this molecule will be negative and likely close to the more negative values observed in the examples.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately:

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of multiple fused rings and functional groups like the ketone and hydroxyl, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O will be in a similar range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule is approximately -0.81967921.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O contains an acetamide group (CC(=O)N) attached to a nitro-substituted benzene ring. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those containing nitro groups and aromatic rings.

For instance, the molecule O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of 0.77682276, and COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.01844956. Both of these molecules contain a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring, similar to the target molecule.

Considering the influence of the acetamide group, which might slightly reduce the electron-withdrawing effect compared to a methoxy group, the property value might be slightly lower than that of O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 but potentially higher than COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O due to the additional electron-withdrawing effect of the acetamide group.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O would be around 0.1.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is not directly present in the examples, but similar to some sulfur-containing compounds.
- An aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent, similar to some chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.
- An ester linkage (C=O)O, which is present in several examples with varying property values.

From the examples:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and chlorine substituents, such as Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (-0.76514103) and Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl (-0.56734819), tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with ester linkages, such as CCCCCC(=O)OCC (-0.52746099), also have negative property values.
- The presence of sulfur, as in CSSC (0.39502805), can sometimes lead to positive values, but this is not consistent across all examples.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of the chlorinated aromatic ring and the ester linkage, which are more dominant features in the examples provided.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be around -0.6, reflecting the influence of the chlorinated aromatic ring and ester linkage.

These molecules share a common feature of having an alcohol group attached to a carbon chain, and the presence of branching does not significantly alter the property value.

The presence of nitrogen atoms and the bicyclic structure are key features.

Considering the examples, the property values for nitrogen-containing heterocycles vary significantly, but they tend to be negative when there are multiple nitrogen atoms and a complex structure, as seen in OCC1OC(C(O)C1O)n2cnc3c(O)ncnc23. However, simpler structures like Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F have positive values.

Given the structure of O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12, which is relatively simple but contains multiple nitrogen atoms, I would predict a property value that is slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the nitrogen atoms and the bicyclic structure.

Therefore, the predicted property value for O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is approximately -0.452.

Similarly, Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cc2cc(Cl)ccc2O has a property value of 0.77682276, and it also contains aromatic rings with additional functional groups.

Given that O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 has two phenyl groups and a central urea linkage, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be positive and likely similar to those of other aromatic-containing compounds with additional functional groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 would be approximately 0.77682276, based on the similarity to other aromatic compounds with carbonyl and nitrogen functionalities.

- CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O has a property value of -0.67449076.

The presence of the guanidine group, which is a strong base, might influence the property value, but the overall structure suggests a tendency towards a negative value due to the sulfonamide and aromatic amine groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 would be around -0.7.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.36816199632566166
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O

This molecule contains several notable features:

1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O):** The presence of nitro groups is significant as they are electron-withdrawing and can influence the electronic properties of the molecule. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (0.01844956) and Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O (0.80320569), have varying property values, but they tend to be positive or slightly negative.

2. **Trifluoromethyl Group (C(F)(F)F):** This is another strong electron-withdrawing group. In the examples, molecules with halogens, especially fluorine, tend to have negative property values, such as ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl (-0.98782762).

3. **Aromatic Ring:** The presence of an aromatic ring can contribute to the stability and electronic properties of the molecule. Aromatic rings are common in the examples, and their influence varies depending on other substituents.

4. **Alkyl Chain with a Double Bond (CC(C)=C):** This feature can influence the molecule's hydrophobicity and steric properties. In the examples, simple alkyl chains like CCCCCCCCC (0.59352098) tend to have positive property values, but the presence of a double bond can alter this.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule has a combination of electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and trifluoromethyl) and an aromatic ring, which suggests a tendency towards a negative property value. However, the presence of the alkyl chain with a double bond might slightly offset this.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around -0.5 to -0.8. Given the examples and the structural analysis, a specific predicted property value could be:

**-0.654321**

True Property: -0.5274609946156709
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. In the examples, esters such as CCC(C)(C)O and CCC(C)C1(CC=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O have property values of 0.78159195 and -0.56211215, respectively. However, these examples are not directly comparable due to differences in structure and functional groups.

A more relevant comparison might be with the molecule CC(C)CCOC=O, which has a property value of -0.52746099. This molecule is also an ester and has a similar functional group arrangement, though it is slightly larger.

Given the structural similarity and the presence of the ester functional group, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC(C)OC=O will be close to that of CC(C)CCOC=O. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O is approximately:

True Property: -0.5673481866008634
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the structures in the examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 can be compared to the following examples:
- Cc1cccc(N)c1, which has a property value of -0.56734819.
- c1ccccc1O, which has a property value of -0.56734819.

Both of these examples involve a benzene ring with a substituent, and the property values are negative. The presence of the hydroxyl group (O) in the target molecule may influence the property value, as seen in the example c1ccccc1O.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of the hydroxyl group, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is likely to be close to the values of the similar examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is approximately -0.56734819.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**: The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)O), a methoxy group (OC), and a thiomethyl group (SC) attached to a benzene ring. The presence of these groups can influence the property value.

2. **Comparison with Similar Structures**:
   - The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has a property value of 0.70447783. It contains a similar phosphorothioate group and a benzene ring with halogen substituents.
   - The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has a property value of -0.9753065. It also contains a phosphorothioate group and a benzene ring with halogen substituents.
   - The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of 0.25287844. It has a phosphorothioate group and a benzene ring with chlorine substituents.

3. **Effect of Substituents**: The presence of the thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) on the benzene ring in the target molecule is different from the halogen substituents in the examples. The thiomethyl group is less electronegative than halogens, which might result in a less negative or more positive property value compared to the halogenated examples.

4. **Prediction**: Considering the structural similarities and differences, the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be closer to the positive range, but not as high as the example with halogens. A reasonable prediction would be around 0.3 to 0.5.

Based on this analysis, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is approximately **0.35**.

- "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" has a property value of -0.78733232.

The molecule "Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl" is similar in structure to these examples, as it is also a highly chlorinated aromatic compound. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar to those of the examples.

Based on this analysis, the predicted property value for "Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl" is approximately -0.78733232.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.05839719298699099
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to the end. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative property values, especially when they are attached to aromatic rings or are part of more complex structures. For instance, CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.93810253, and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.21909949.

However, the molecule CCCN(=O)=O is simpler and lacks the complexity and additional electron-withdrawing groups that might further lower the property value. The presence of the nitro group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group, suggests a negative property value, but not as negative as those with additional electron-withdrawing groups or aromatic systems.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around -0.5. This accounts for the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group while recognizing the simplicity of the molecule compared to more complex examples.

- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of 0.65050115.
- c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12 has a property value of 0.67118743.

Both of these examples involve bromine-substituted aromatic rings, and their property values are relatively close to each other. The presence of a fluorine atom in Fc1cccc(Br)c1 might slightly alter the property value compared to the chlorine or additional aromatic ring in the examples, but it is likely to remain in a similar range.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be around 0.65 to 0.67. Therefore, a specific predicted property value could be approximately 0.660.

- Molecules with acetamide groups, such as CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, have a property value of 0.85042709.

The presence of both an acetamide group and a bromobenzene moiety suggests that the property value might be influenced by both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects. The examples show that bromine substitution tends to lower the property value, while acetamide groups can have varying effects depending on the rest of the structure.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to be negative, influenced by the bromine substitution. A reasonable estimate, considering the examples, would be around -0.7 to -0.8.

3. O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O (0.37357558) - This molecule is dinitrobenzene, a benzene ring with two nitro groups.

Benzaldehyde is structurally similar to these examples, particularly the first one, as it has a carbonyl group directly attached to the benzene ring. The presence of the carbonyl group (C=O) in benzaldehyde is similar to the amide group in the first example, which also contains a carbonyl group.

Given the examples and the structural similarity, the property value for benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) is likely to be in the range of the first example, which is 0.56055894. However, since benzaldehyde is a simpler structure without additional functional groups like the hydroxyl group in the first example, the property value might be slightly lower.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) would be approximately 0.5.

True Property: 0.733177990690115
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring, similar to some of the examples. The presence of the nitro group (N(=O)=O) is a significant electron-withdrawing group, which tends to lower the property value, as seen in examples like Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 (-0.98059506) and Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (-0.78733232).

Additionally, the molecule contains a lactam (cyclic amide) structure, which can also influence the property value. The presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups and the heterocyclic structure suggest a more negative property value.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.9.

True Property: 0.2149299804247765
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings and nitrogen-containing functional groups tend to have property values that are either slightly positive or slightly negative, depending on the specific structure and functional groups present. For instance:

- Nc1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.56734819.
- N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 has a property value of 0.21492998.

The molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally similar to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, but with a hydrazine linkage instead of an azo linkage. The presence of the hydrazine group might slightly alter the electronic properties compared to the azo group, but the overall aromatic character and nitrogen content are similar.

Considering these factors, the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be close to that of N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, but possibly slightly lower due to the different electronic effects of the hydrazine group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be around 0.15.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. 

Looking at the examples, we can see that cyclic structures with amide groups, such as O=C1N(COC(=O)CC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (-0.89911051) and O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC (0.80704534), have varying property values. The presence of additional functional groups and the overall molecular structure influence these values.

The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is similar to the diketopiperazine structure, which is a common motif in peptides. The examples suggest that cyclic amide structures can have negative property values, especially when they are more complex or have additional functional groups.

Considering the structural similarity to other cyclic amides and the lack of additional functional groups that might significantly alter the property, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.5. This is based on the trend observed in the examples, where cyclic amides tend to have negative property values.

- Ic1ccccc1 has a property value of 0.81072796.
- C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13 has a property value of 0.84333547.

These examples suggest that aromatic compounds with halogen substituents, particularly chlorine, tend to have positive property values. Given the structure of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, which is similar to these examples, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately 0.82.

The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically a diethylbenzene. In the examples, we have several aromatic compounds and alkyl chains, and we can observe some trends:

1. Aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro groups) tend to have negative property values.
2. Simple alkyl chains or alkyl-substituted aromatics without strong electron-withdrawing or donating groups tend to have positive property values.

For example:
- CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 (a long alkyl chain with a benzene ring) has a property value of 0.82006902.
- Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) has a property value of -0.56734819, likely due to the electron-donating nature of the amine group.

The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 lacks strong electron-withdrawing or donating groups and is similar to the alkyl-substituted benzene example with a positive property value. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value for this molecule.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be around 0.48992811, similar to other alkyl-substituted aromatics without strong electron-withdrawing or donating groups.

Given the structural similarity, particularly the presence of the benzene ring and the sulfonamide group, the predicted property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is likely to be close to 0.01844956.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is approximately 0.01844956.

To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically triphenylene. It consists of four fused benzene rings, forming a planar, aromatic structure.

Considering the structural similarity to these examples, particularly the second one, which is a larger polycyclic aromatic system, we can infer that the property value for triphenylene is likely to be in a similar range. Given the trend in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 would be around -0.04634992.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the structures in the examples, particularly those with multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups, which tend to have negative property values.

For instance, the molecule Oc1cccc(O)c1 has a property value of -0.67449076, and it contains a single aromatic ring with two hydroxyl groups. The given molecule has a more complex structure with additional aromatic rings and functional groups, which could further influence the property value.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, which often contribute to negative property values, I would predict that the property value for the given molecule is likely to be negative and possibly more negative than -0.67449076 due to the additional aromatic content and functional groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 would be approximately -0.85.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (property value: 0.25287844).
- An amide group (NC(C)=O), which is present in several molecules with negative property values, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (-0.81967921) and CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCCCC2 (-0.56211215).
- A thioester linkage (SC), which is not directly represented in the examples but can be considered similar to other sulfur-containing groups.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a positive contribution, while the amide group suggests a negative contribution. The overall balance of these effects, along with the specific arrangement of atoms, leads to a prediction.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be slightly positive, around 0.1.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, especially those with aromatic or conjugated systems, tend to have negative property values. For instance, Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of -0.98782762, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -0.78733232. These examples suggest that the presence of chlorine atoms in a conjugated or aromatic system contributes to a negative property value.

Given that Cl\C=C/Cl is a simple alkene with two chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value, although it may not be as negative as those with more complex aromatic systems. Based on the trend observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around -0.5. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl is approximately -0.5.

For instance, the compound c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 has a property value of 0.21492998, and CNc1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.56734819.

Considering pyridine's structure and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccncc1 would be around 0.21492998, as it is a simple aromatic heterocycle with a nitrogen atom, similar to the example given. Therefore, the predicted property value for pyridine (c1ccncc1) is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains several functional groups and structural features:
- An ester linkage (OC(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)
- An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring
- A pyridine-like structure (ccnc)

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with ester linkages, such as CCCCOC(=O)CC, tend to have negative property values.
- Aromatic rings with halogens, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1, also tend to have negative property values.
- Amide linkages, such as in CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2, can have slightly negative to neutral property values.

Considering these observations, the presence of both ester and amide linkages, along with a chlorinated aromatic ring, suggests a negative property value. The complexity and the presence of multiple aromatic systems might slightly mitigate the negativity, but overall, the property is likely to remain negative.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol, specifically hexanol. In the examples, linear alkanes and alcohols tend to have positive property values. For instance, OC1CCCCCCC1 (a cyclic alcohol) has a property value of 0.78159195, and CCCCCCCCI (a linear alkane with iodine) has a property value of 0.15545469. 

Considering the structure of CCCCCO, which is a simple linear alcohol, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value, likely closer to the lower end of the positive range due to its simplicity and lack of additional functional groups that might significantly alter the property.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be approximately 0.15.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is often associated with electron-withdrawing properties.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which can also have electron-withdrawing effects.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which can contribute to stability and influence the overall electronic properties.
- An ether linkage (CCO1), which can have a slight electron-donating effect.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with strong electron-withdrawing groups, such as sulfonyl and carbonyl groups, tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of an aromatic ring can sometimes lead to positive values, but in this case, the electron-withdrawing groups are likely to dominate.

Based on these considerations, the predicted property value for CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is likely to be negative. Given the examples, a reasonable estimate would be around -0.5 to -0.7. Therefore, a specific predicted value could be:

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:

1. **Ester Groups (COC(=O))**: Esters are generally associated with moderate to low property values, often negative, due to their polar nature.

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: Nitro groups are typically associated with negative property values due to their electron-withdrawing nature.

3. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: Aromatic rings can contribute to both positive and negative property values depending on the substituents attached.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring (C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1))**: The presence of a nitrogen atom in the ring can influence the property value, often leading to a more negative value due to increased polarity.

5. **Methyl Groups (C)**: Methyl groups generally contribute positively to the property value due to their hydrophobic nature.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples provided, the molecule has a combination of both positive and negative contributing groups. However, the presence of the nitro group and the ester groups, which are strong electron-withdrawing and polar, suggests that the overall property value is likely to be negative.

Based on the examples, particularly those with nitro groups and esters, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.8. Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule is:

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two amide groups and a cyclohexane-like structure due to the cyclization of the peptide bond. This structure is relatively polar due to the presence of carbonyl and amide groups, which can engage in hydrogen bonding and dipole-dipole interactions.

Looking at the examples, molecules with polar functional groups like carbonyls and amides tend to have negative property values. For instance, molecules like CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C and ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O have negative values, indicating that the presence of carbonyl and amide groups contributes to a negative property value.

Considering the structural similarity and the presence of polar functional groups, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be negative. Based on the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.7.

To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the trends and patterns from the given examples. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

In the given examples, simple aliphatic hydrocarbons like CCCCC and CCC(C)(C)CC have positive property values (e.g., 0.59352098). However, when halogens like chlorine (Cl) are introduced, the property values tend to become more negative. For instance, Clc1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.79125118, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of -0.42435614.

The molecule ClCC is a simple chloroalkane, specifically chloroethane. Based on the trend that the introduction of chlorine tends to decrease the property value, we can predict that ClCC will have a negative property value. However, since it is a small molecule with only one chlorine atom, the effect might not be as pronounced as in larger, more complex chlorinated compounds.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be around -0.5.

   - c1ccccc1SC has a property value of -0.99259984.
   - ClC(=C)Cl has a property value of -0.82692858.

2. The presence of multiple halogen atoms, especially heavier halogens like bromine, might further influence the property value towards the negative side.

Considering these observations, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 will be negative and likely similar to other halogenated aromatic compounds. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around -0.8.

Considering the structure of the given molecule and the trends observed in the examples, it is likely that the property value will be negative due to the presence of the phosphoric acid ester group and the aromatic rings.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value for the given molecule to be approximately -0.5.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -0.24658561784004998
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3) attached to a phenyl ring, which is a common feature in several molecules with varying property values.
- A piperidine-like ring with two chlorine atoms and a ketone group, which introduces additional electronegative atoms and potential steric effects.

From the examples:
- Molecules with halogenated aromatic rings and additional electronegative groups (like nitro groups) tend to have negative property values, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (-0.99926988) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (0.33240355).
- The presence of a trifluoromethyl group in aromatic systems can also influence the property value, as seen in CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C (-0.99402226).

Considering these factors, the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O is likely to have a negative property value due to the combination of halogenation and the presence of a carbonyl group in a constrained ring system.

Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.9.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.01844955916336563
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitrobenzene derivative with a methoxy group attached to the benzene ring. 

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.37357558, which is positive, but it has two nitro groups. The molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, which has a nitro group and multiple chlorine atoms, has a property value of -0.87396268.

The presence of a methoxy group, which is an electron-donating group, might slightly increase the property value compared to a molecule with only electron-withdrawing groups. However, the overall effect of the nitro group is likely to dominate.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is likely to be negative, but not as negative as molecules with multiple electron-withdrawing groups. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.5.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them with the examples provided. The molecule is highly chlorinated and resembles a polycyclic structure with multiple chlorine atoms, similar to some of the examples given.

From the examples, highly chlorinated compounds tend to have negative property values. For instance, ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl has a property value of -0.27078961, and Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of -0.78733232. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally contributes to a more negative property value.

Considering the high degree of chlorination and the complex polycyclic structure, I would predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is likely to be quite negative. Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately -0.85.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.5274609946156709
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with ester groups (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1) tend to have positive property values.
- Molecules with simple alkyl chains (e.g., CCCCCCCC=C) also tend to have positive property values, although the presence of unsaturation or other functional groups can influence this.

Given that CCCOC=O is a relatively simple ester with a small alkyl chain, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. Based on the examples, a value around 0.5 to 0.6 seems plausible for similar structures.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O is approximately 0.560.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.5274609946156709
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is a long-chain ester, specifically decyl acetate. It consists of a long hydrophobic alkyl chain (10 carbon atoms) and an ester functional group. In the examples, we have:

- CCOC, which is a simple ether, with a property value of 0.78159195.
- CCCCCCc1ccccc1, which is a long alkyl chain with an aromatic ring, with a property value of 0.82006902.
- CC, a simple alkane, with a property value of 0.59352098.

The presence of the ester group in CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC introduces some polarity, but the long alkyl chain contributes significantly to hydrophobicity. The examples suggest that molecules with long alkyl chains and some degree of polarity (like ethers and esters) tend to have positive property values.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to the values for other long-chain molecules with polar functional groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O), which is often associated with negative property values in the examples.
- Two chlorine atoms, which are also associated with negative property values.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which can have varying effects depending on the context.
- Aromatic rings, which are present in many examples with both positive and negative values.

Looking at the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.99926988.
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, also have a property value of -0.99926988.

Given these observations, the presence of both nitro and chlorine groups suggests a strong negative influence on the property value. Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O is likely to be similar to those examples with strong negative values.

The molecule in question contains two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are similar to the phosphorothioate group in the molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 0.8372999. Additionally, the molecule has aromatic rings with ether linkages, similar to other aromatic compounds in the examples.

Considering the presence of these functional groups and the overall structure, the molecule is likely to have a property value in a similar range to the example with the phosphorothioate group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 would be approximately 0.837, given the structural similarities and the influence of the phosphorothioate groups.

True Property: 0.01844955916336563
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can identify similar structures:
- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which is nitrotoluene, has a property value of 0.77682276.
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, which is a chlorinated phenol, has a property value of 0.81846586.

The presence of the nitro group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, and the hydroxyl group, which is an electron-donating group, will influence the property value. The nitro group tends to decrease the property value compared to a simple phenol, while the hydroxyl group can increase it.

Considering these factors and the examples, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is likely to be close to the value for nitrotoluene, but slightly lower due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is approximately 0.750.

OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O

This molecule is a complex sugar, likely a polysaccharide or a derivative, given the multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic acetal structures. In the examples provided, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic structures, such as sugars, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O has a property value of 0.33794121.

Considering the structural similarity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, which generally contribute to a positive property value due to their polar nature and potential for hydrogen bonding, I would predict that the property value for the given molecule is also positive and likely in a similar range to the example of the sugar-like structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately:

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -0.9780312964316601
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne with a terminal triple bond, also known as 1-butyne. In the examples, molecules with unsaturated bonds, such as triple bonds or aromatic rings, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule N#Cc1ccccc1C#N, which contains triple bonds, has a property value of -0.93008372. Similarly, CCC(C)C(=O)C, which contains a carbonyl group and a branched alkane, has a property value of -0.70905071.

Given the presence of the triple bond and the relatively simple structure of CCC#C, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Considering the examples, a value around -0.7 to -0.9 seems plausible.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCC#C is approximately -0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 0.8372999.
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl, which has a property value of -0.10831352, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of -0.78733232.

Considering these structural similarities, the presence of the phosphorothioate group tends to increase the property value, while the multiple chlorine substituents on the aromatic ring tend to decrease it. Balancing these effects, the predicted property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be closer to the lower end of the positive range, but not as low as the highly chlorinated examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is approximately 0.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is a pyridine derivative with a hydrazide group (C(=O)NN) attached to the ring. In the examples, we have several aromatic compounds with various substituents, and their properties range from negative to positive values.

The presence of nitrogen atoms in the ring, as seen in pyridine derivatives, often contributes to a more negative property value due to increased electron-withdrawing effects. For instance, the molecule Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2 has a property value of -0.67917668, which is quite negative, likely due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitrogen atoms and the carbonyl group.

Additionally, the presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a hydrazide group (NN) can further influence the property value. In the examples, molecules with carbonyl groups and nitrogen-containing functional groups tend to have negative property values, such as Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C with a value of -0.86768039.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is likely to be negative. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.7.

   - The molecule has an aliphatic chain and a piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1), which is a saturated cyclic amine.

2. **Comparison with Examples:**
   - The presence of the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage suggests a tendency towards a negative property value, as seen in the examples with similar functional groups.
   - The aliphatic and cyclic amine components might slightly offset the negativity, but the overall influence of the phosphorothioate and amide groups is likely to dominate.

3. **Prediction:**
   - Given the structural similarities to molecules with negative property values, and considering the influence of the phosphorothioate and amide groups, the predicted property value for CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is likely to be negative and in the range of the examples with similar functional groups.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is approximately **-0.75**.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves analyzing the functional groups, ring systems, and overall molecular geometry. The given molecule, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, contains several features that can influence its property value:

1. **Cyclohexane Rings**: The presence of multiple cyclohexane rings, which are non-polar, can contribute positively to the property value, similar to other cyclohexane-containing molecules in the examples.

2. **Ketone Group (C=O)**: The ketone group is polar and can contribute negatively to the property value, as seen in other molecules with ketone groups.

3. **Hydroxyl Group (O)**: The hydroxyl group is polar and can also contribute negatively to the property value.

4. **Alkyne Group (C#C)**: The alkyne group is less polar than other functional groups and may have a neutral or slightly negative contribution.

5. **Overall Structure**: The molecule has a complex, multi-ring structure with both polar and non-polar components. This complexity can lead to a balanced property value, depending on the relative contributions of each functional group.

Considering these factors and comparing them to the examples provided, the molecule's property value is likely to be slightly negative due to the presence of polar groups (ketone and hydroxyl) and the complex ring structure. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.41289334, similar to other complex cyclic structures with polar groups.

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings. The presence of methoxy groups (OC) and hydroxyl groups (O) suggests some degree of polarity, but the overall structure is quite large and complex.

From the examples provided, we can observe that:

- Molecules with large, complex, and polycyclic structures, such as c1cc2cccc3c4cccc5cccc(c(c1)c23)c54 and c1ccc2cc3c4cccc5cccc(c3cc2c1)c45, tend to have property values around -0.04634992.
- Molecules with multiple ether linkages and aromatic rings, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, have more negative property values, like -0.88762861.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple ether and aromatic components in the target molecule, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is negative and possibly close to those of similarly complex structures.

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of specific functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which consists of a phenol group (Oc1ccccc1) with a chlorine substituent. In the examples, phenol derivatives (e.g., Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O) have a property value of 0.01844956, and chlorinated aromatic compounds (e.g., Clc1ccccc1I) tend to have negative property values, such as -0.99182725.

Considering the combination of a phenol group and a chlorine substituent, the property value is likely to be influenced by both the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine and the electron-donating effect of the hydroxyl group. The presence of chlorine generally leads to a more negative property value, while the hydroxyl group might slightly offset this effect.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be slightly negative, but not as negative as the highly chlorinated compounds. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.2.

Considering these observations, the presence of both chlorinated aromatic and polar functional groups suggests a negative property value. The combination of these features in the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 is likely to result in a property value similar to other chlorinated aromatic compounds with polar groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be approximately -0.75.

Considering these observations, the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl is likely to have a negative property value. Given the structural complexity and the presence of multiple aromatic and heterocyclic rings, a value around -0.9 seems reasonable based on the trends observed in the examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl is approximately -0.9.

Given the trend in the examples, where the presence of chlorine atoms tends to increase the property value, and considering the structural simplicity of ClCCl compared to ClCCCl, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for ClCCl would be slightly lower than that of ClCCCl.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be approximately 0.8.

From the examples, we can observe that phenol derivatives tend to have negative property values. For instance, Oc1cccc(O)c1 has a property value of -0.67449076, and c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC has a property value of -0.67449076 as well. These examples suggest that the presence of hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings tends to result in negative property values.

Considering the structure of Cc1cccc(C)c1O, which is similar to phenol derivatives, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Given the examples, a value around -0.67449076 seems plausible, as it aligns with the trend observed for similar structures.

To predict the property of the molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a dichlorinated biphenyl, similar to the chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.

The examples show that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have negative property values. For instance, Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.81846586, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -0.78733232. The latter is more similar to the given molecule in terms of structure and chlorine content.

Given the structural similarity to Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of -0.78733232, and considering the pattern of negative values for chlorinated aromatics, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is likely to be close to -0.78733232.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is approximately -0.78733232.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.16694133447550707
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple hydrocarbon with a double bond and a branched structure.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Simple hydrocarbons with linear or branched structures, such as CCCCCC (0.59352098) and CCCCCCCC (0.59352098), tend to have positive property values.
2. Molecules with double bonds, such as CCCCCCCC=C (-0.16694133), have slightly negative property values, but this is for a longer chain.
3. The presence of functional groups like carbonyls, nitro groups, or halogens tends to influence the property value significantly, often making it more negative.

Given that CC=C(C)C is a small, branched hydrocarbon with a double bond, it is likely to have a property value that is slightly positive or close to zero, similar to other small hydrocarbons without significant functional groups.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around 0.5.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.847634817073241
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane), we can analyze the patterns in the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, especially those with high symmetry or simple structures, tend to have negative property values. For instance, ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of -0.9753065, and Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -0.10214185. These examples suggest that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms in a relatively simple structure tends to result in a negative property value.

Given that ClCCl is a simple molecule with two chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Based on the pattern observed, a plausible prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around -0.9. However, without more specific data or a clear quantitative model, this is an estimation based on the observed trends in the provided examples.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.8184658638972385
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically a trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of 0.81846586. This molecule is a dichlorophenol.
2. The presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in the example of Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1, which has a high property value of 0.65432368.
3. The presence of an -OH group (phenol) also tends to increase the property value, as seen in CC(O)c1ccccc1 with a property value of 0.67118743.

Given that Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a trichlorophenol, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be higher than that of the dichlorophenol example (0.81846586) due to the additional chlorine atom.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl would be slightly higher than 0.81846586. A specific predicted value could be around 0.85.

True Property: 0.43710146822555046
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known molecules and their properties.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and hydroxyl groups, as well as aromatic rings. From the examples provided, molecules with extensive aromatic systems and multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (such as ethers and hydroxyls) tend to have negative property values. This is likely due to the electron-withdrawing nature of these groups and the overall molecular complexity.

Given the structural complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for this molecule. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.9.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.9087236371278627
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) atoms, along with the tert-butyl group, suggests a potential for moderate polarity and some steric bulk.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar functional groups and structural features, such as CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C, which has a property value of -0.45565319, can provide insight. This example also contains a thiosemicarbazide-like moiety and a tert-butyl group, which are key features in the molecule we are analyzing.

Given the structural similarities, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C will be in a similar range. Therefore, the predicted property value for this molecule is approximately -0.45565319.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.37896921930352556
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is an ester with a phenyl group, similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's consider the example CCCCCC(=O)OC, which is an ester with a property value of -0.52746099. Another relevant example is CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, which is a diketone with a phenyl group and has a property value of -0.86448617. The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is structurally more similar to the ester example, as it contains an ester linkage and a phenyl group.

Given these observations, the property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is likely to be closer to that of the ester example, CCCCCC(=O)OC. Therefore, I would predict the property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 to be approximately -0.52746099.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.4083625974543336
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom at the end. In the examples, we have a similar structure, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which has a property value of 0.67118743. This molecule contains a bromine atom attached to an aromatic ring, which might contribute positively to the property value.

Additionally, the example CCCCCCCCO has a property value of 0.78159195, which is a linear alkyl chain with an alcohol group. The presence of the bromine atom in CCCCCCCBr might have a similar effect as the alcohol group in CCCCCCCCO, potentially leading to a positive property value.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to the values of the examples with similar structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr is approximately 0.7.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 0.7815919484358477
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of organic and inorganic compounds with different functional groups and structural features. The property values range from negative to positive, indicating a diverse set of properties.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is a small, non-polar molecule with no additional functional groups or complex structures. In the given examples, small and simple molecules like CCC (propane) and NC(=O)N (urea) have positive property values, while more complex or highly substituted molecules tend to have negative values.

Considering the simplicity and non-polar nature of CO, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is closer to the positive range, similar to other small and simple molecules. However, CO is also known for its unique properties, such as its ability to bind to metal centers and its role as a ligand, which might influence its property value.

Based on these considerations, I would predict a property value for CO that is slightly positive, reflecting its simplicity and non-polar nature, while accounting for its unique characteristics.

Predicted property value for CO: 0.59352098
