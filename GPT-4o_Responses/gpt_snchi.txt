SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.9318941887606693
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the patterns and trends from the given examples. The molecule in question is a linear ester with a long alkyl chain, similar to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Long linear alkanes and their derivatives tend to have positive property values, as seen with CCCCCCC (0.5149252) and CCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (0.46185898).
- The presence of an ester group (as in CCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC) does not significantly alter the positive trend seen in long alkyl chains.

Given these observations, the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is expected to have a property value similar to CCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, but slightly lower due to the shorter chain length.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be around 0.4.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 0.37321318128245085
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxygen and a nitrogen atom. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings and heteroatoms.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with chlorine substituents tend to have positive property values (e.g., Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, 0.86672003).
- Heterocyclic compounds with nitrogen and oxygen can have varying property values depending on the specific structure and substituents (e.g., c1cncnc1, 0.8994563; O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1, 0.57863337).

Considering these observations, the presence of chlorine, the aromatic ring, and the heterocyclic structure with an oxygen and nitrogen atom, the property value is likely to be positive but not extremely high, as the structure is not heavily substituted with electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around 0.5.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.7908725006733414
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite, which contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have positive property values (0.29526734). However, the presence of the isopropyl group, which is a small alkyl group, might influence the property value.

Considering the examples, molecules with small alkyl groups like CCC(C)CC (0.13374727) and ClCC (0.75458642) have positive property values. The combination of the nitro group and the isopropyl group suggests a positive property value, but likely not as high as those with larger aromatic systems or multiple functional groups.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O would be around 0.2 to 0.3. Therefore, a specific predicted property value could be:

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: -0.9321843661358735
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. The molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple rings and carbonyl groups, similar to some of the examples given.

From the examples, we can observe that complex polycyclic structures with carbonyl groups, such as CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C, tend to have negative property values. The presence of carbonyl groups and the overall complexity of the structure often contribute to a more negative property value.

Considering these factors, I would predict that the property value for the given molecule, CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, is likely to be negative. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.4.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.9058002880971616
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A benzene ring with two fluorine atoms (similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.17787516).
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N) connecting to another benzene ring with a chlorine substituent (similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 0.63841058).

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like fluorine and chlorine generally tends to lower the property value, as seen in the examples with halogenated benzene rings. The amide linkage might contribute to a more positive value due to its polar nature, but the overall influence of the halogens is likely more significant.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, the predicted property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 is likely to be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the halogens.

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 0.42142600395533714
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with a linear chain and a branching methyl group. It is similar in structure to other small aliphatic ethers and alcohols in the examples, such as CCCCCCO (-0.80752445) and CCCCC(C)(O)CC (0.60873843). The presence of the ether group (C-O-C) and the branching methyl group suggests that the property value might be influenced by these features.

Given the examples, ethers and alcohols tend to have negative property values, but the presence of branching can increase the property value. Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C would be slightly negative, but not as negative as linear alcohols or ethers without branching.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C could be around -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Alkyl Chain**: The presence of an alkyl chain (CCC(C)-) is common in several examples, often contributing to a slightly positive or neutral property value.

2. **Pyrrole Ring**: The pyrrole ring (n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O) is a heterocyclic aromatic compound. In the examples, heterocycles with nitrogen often have negative property values, especially when they are part of a more complex structure.

3. **Substituents**: The presence of a bromine atom (Br) and carbonyl groups (C=O) can influence the property value. Bromine is seen in some examples with negative property values, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.8237735). Carbonyl groups are also present in several examples with negative values.

Considering these factors, the molecule has structural features that are similar to those in examples with negative property values. The combination of the pyrrole ring, bromine, and carbonyl groups suggests a tendency towards a negative property value.

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O to be approximately -0.85.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of aromatic rings, functional groups, and overall molecular symmetry.

Biphenyl consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond, making it a relatively simple aromatic compound. In the examples provided, aromatic compounds with similar structures, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34 has a property value of 0.2692054, and c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 has a property value of -0.85979991.

Considering the structure of biphenyl and the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for biphenyl, as it is a simpler aromatic compound compared to the more complex polycyclic structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around -0.5.

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.44087713133824996
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the examples provided and look for patterns or similarities. The molecule CCCCCS is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a sulfur atom at the end. This structure is similar to other linear or branched alkanes and alkenes in the examples, which generally have negative property values.

For instance:
- CCCCCCC(C)C has a property value of -0.81451082.
- CCC1CCCCC1 has a property value of -0.91879724.
- CCCCCCCC=C has a property value of -0.79239884.

These examples suggest that linear or slightly branched hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values. The presence of sulfur, which is more electronegative than carbon, might slightly alter the property value, but it is unlikely to change the overall trend significantly.

Based on this analysis, I would predict that the property value for CCCCCS is likely to be negative and similar in magnitude to the other linear hydrocarbons. A reasonable estimate for the property value of CCCCCS would be around -0.8.

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.8583954396526172
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol, specifically a tertiary alcohol, with a structure similar to some of the aliphatic and alcohol-containing molecules in the examples.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Aliphatic hydrocarbons like CCCC/C=C/C (0.80439363) and CCC(C)(C)C (-0.72507978) have varying property values, but generally, more branching and the presence of functional groups like alcohols tend to increase the property value.
- Alcohols like CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O (0.73408862) and CC(C)CC(C)O (0.12868833) have positive property values, indicating that the presence of an alcohol group contributes positively to the property value.

Considering these observations, the presence of the alcohol group in CCCC(C)(C)CO is likely to contribute positively to its property value. Additionally, the branching in the molecule may also influence the property value, as seen in the examples.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO would be around 0.6, as it is a branched alcohol similar to the examples with positive property values. Therefore, the predicted specific property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is approximately:

True Property: -0.8855154927630721
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is a naphthalene derivative, which is similar to some of the examples provided.

Looking at the examples, the molecule Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 has a property value of -0.10982664. This molecule is structurally similar to Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, as both are naphthalene derivatives with a methyl group attached. The main difference is the position of the methyl group.

Considering the structural similarity and the property values of similar molecules, the predicted property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 would likely be close to -0.10982664. However, since the methyl group is in a different position, there might be a slight variation.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 would be approximately -0.10.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic imide, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -0.8369176. The main difference in the new molecule is the presence of a longer alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) attached to the cyclic imide structure.

The presence of additional alkyl groups generally increases hydrophobicity, which can influence the property value. However, the core structure remains a cyclic imide, which tends to have negative property values in the examples provided.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is likely to be slightly less negative than -0.8369176 due to the increased hydrophobicity from the longer alkyl chain. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.800.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group is significant because it is highly electronegative and can influence the electronic properties of the molecule.

Looking at the examples, we can see that molecules with aromatic rings and electronegative substituents tend to have negative property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of -0.51480511, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -0.86616937. These examples suggest that the presence of halogens and aromatic rings generally leads to negative property values.

Given the structure of trifluoromethylbenzene and the trends observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 will also be negative. Considering the strong electron-withdrawing effect of the trifluoromethyl group, the predicted property value is likely to be moderately negative.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.6.

To predict the property value for the molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, we need to consider the structural features and functional groups present in the molecule and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a sugar alcohol, specifically a form of glucose, which is a polyol with multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups. In the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a property value of 0.13357994. This suggests that the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups tends to result in a positive property value, likely due to increased solubility or hydrogen bonding potential.

Given the structural similarity to the example with a property value of 0.13357994, and considering the consistent presence of hydroxyl groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O will be similar.

Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately 0.13357994.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. It resembles some of the more complex cyclic structures in the examples, such as CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of 0.30072005, and CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C, which has a property value of 0.79102735.

Given the presence of multiple rings, ketone groups, and an ester group, the molecule is likely to have a positive property value, similar to the examples with complex cyclic structures and multiple functional groups. The presence of the ester group might slightly lower the property value compared to a similar structure without it.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C would be around 0.5. This value reflects the balance between the structural complexity and the functional groups present in the molecule.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of a ketone group, which can influence the electronic distribution and potentially the property value, the molecule might have a property value in a similar range to other polycyclic compounds with ketone groups.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O would be approximately -0.37.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is an aromatic compound with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) and an acetamide group (CC(=O)N) attached to a benzene ring. The presence of the nitro group is significant because it is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which often influences the property values in the examples provided.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups attached to aromatic rings, such as O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (-0.85006383) and O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12 (-0.92935693), tend to have negative property values. Additionally, the presence of an acetamide group, which is less electron-withdrawing than a nitro group, might slightly mitigate the effect but not enough to make the property positive.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative, similar to other nitro-aromatic compounds. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.8, given the influence of the nitro group and the structural similarity to other examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.8.

   - The presence of sulfur, as in CSSC (-0.90461654), also tends to contribute to negative values.
   - The presence of an ester linkage is seen in CCC(C)OC(=O)C (-0.85174594), which also has a negative value.

3. **Overall Prediction:**
   - Given the presence of chlorine, sulfur, and ester linkages, which are associated with negative property values in the examples, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for this molecule.
   - Considering the structural complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups that contribute to negative values, the predicted property value is likely to be moderately negative.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 is approximately **-0.65**.

The molecule CC(C)(C)CO is tert-butanol, which is a simple alcohol with a tertiary carbon. In the examples, we have several alcohols and hydrocarbons with varying chain lengths and branching:

1. CCCCCCC(C)O (0.64649009) - A long-chain alcohol with branching.
2. CCC(C)CO (0.52658147) - A shorter chain alcohol with branching.
3. CCC (0.49131435) - A simple hydrocarbon with no functional groups.

The tert-butanol structure is similar to CCC(C)CO but with an additional methyl group, making it more branched. The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) typically increases the property value compared to hydrocarbons without functional groups.

Given the examples, tert-butanol is likely to have a property value slightly higher than CCC(C)CO due to its increased branching and the presence of the hydroxyl group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO would be around 0.55 to 0.60.

Based on this analysis, the predicted property value for CC(C)(C)CO is approximately:

The molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is a bicyclic compound with two nitrogen-containing heterocycles, specifically a purine-like structure. This type of structure is similar to nucleobases, which are generally polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding due to the presence of nitrogen atoms and carbonyl groups.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitrogen-containing heterocycles and carbonyl groups, such as Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F (-0.64580073) and Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1 (-0.29579151), tend to have negative property values. These examples suggest that the presence of nitrogen heterocycles and carbonyl groups contributes to a negative property value.

Considering the structural similarities and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for the molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is likely to be negative. Based on the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a urea derivative with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. This structure is similar to other aromatic compounds with amide or urea linkages in the examples. For instance, the molecule NC(=O)c1cccnc1 has a property value of -0.84389975, and it contains an amide linkage with an aromatic ring. Similarly, CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1 has a property value of -0.61412801, and it also features an amide linkage with aromatic rings.

Considering the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl group and the resonance stabilization provided by the phenyl rings, the property value is likely to be negative. The presence of two phenyl groups might lead to a more negative value compared to single phenyl or heteroaromatic systems.

Based on these observations and comparisons, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 would be approximately -0.75.

To predict the property value for the molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The given molecule is triphenylene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a planar structure composed of four fused benzene rings.

From the examples, we observe that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and molecules with extended conjugation tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1, which is a larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a property value of 0.86083502. Similarly, other aromatic compounds with extended conjugation also show relatively high property values.

Given that triphenylene is a smaller polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compared to the example with a value of 0.86083502, we can expect its property value to be somewhat lower but still positive due to its aromatic and conjugated nature.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (triphenylene) would be around 0.75.

- An amidine group (NC(=N)N), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.

From the examples, molecules with polar groups, electron-withdrawing groups, and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values. For instance, molecules like Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl and ClC(=C(Cl)C(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl) have negative values due to their electron-withdrawing chlorine atoms and aromatic rings.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is likely to be negative. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.75.

True Property: 0.3133329516483917
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is often associated with negative property values in the examples.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which can also contribute to a negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
- An alkene group (C=C) attached to the nitrogen, which might slightly offset the negative contribution but not significantly.

Based on the examples, molecules with nitro groups and electron-withdrawing groups like trifluoromethyl tend to have negative property values. For instance, Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.51477298, and Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.90474749.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative and in the range of the examples with similar functional groups. A reasonable prediction would be around -0.75.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.5803343449974643
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl acetate, an ester. Esters in the examples provided have varying property values, but we can look for similar structures to make a prediction. 

- The molecule CC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of 0.19102678. This molecule is similar to isopropyl acetate, as it also contains an ester functional group and a similar carbon chain length.
- The molecule CCCCCCOC(=O)C has a property value of 0.41987157. This is another ester with a longer carbon chain, which might contribute to a higher property value.

Considering the structural similarity of isopropyl acetate to these examples, particularly the first one, we can predict that the property value for CC(C)OC=O will be close to 0.19102678, but possibly slightly lower due to the shorter carbon chain.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O is approximately 0.15.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the structures in the examples.

1. **Structural Analysis**: The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a phenol with two methyl groups. Phenols generally have moderate to low property values, often negative, due to the presence of the hydroxyl group which can engage in hydrogen bonding and affect the overall electronic distribution.

2. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - The molecule c1ccccc1O (phenol) has a property value of -0.41677148.
   - The molecule Cc1cccc(N)c1 (aniline derivative) has a property value of -0.58923021.
   - The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1 (toluene derivative) has a property value of 0.47418406.

3. **Prediction**: Given that the molecule in question is a methyl-substituted phenol, it is likely to have a property value closer to that of phenol (c1ccccc1O) but slightly more positive due to the electron-donating effect of the methyl groups. However, the presence of the hydroxyl group will still likely result in a negative property value.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be around -0.3.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: -0.9309586275249716
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)O), which is similar to the phosphorothioate groups in the examples COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl. The property values for these molecules are -0.31760439, -0.93196519, and 0.90502448, respectively. The variation in these values is likely due to the different substituents on the aromatic ring.

The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) on the aromatic ring. The presence of a thiomethyl group is unique among the examples, but the methyl group is similar to the methyl groups in other examples, such as Cc1ccc(O)c(C)c1 and Cc1cccc2c1ccc3ccccc32, which have property values of 0.65596343 and -0.74950152, respectively.

Considering the structural similarities and the range of property values in the examples, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the specific substituents on the aromatic ring, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 would be around 0.5. This value reflects the influence of the phosphorothioate group and the moderate electron-donating effects of the thiomethyl and methyl groups on the aromatic ring.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.07077894051172481
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the patterns and trends from the given examples. The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we observe that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have negative property values. For instance:
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of -0.68589784.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -0.86616937.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is similar in structure to these examples, with multiple chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings. Given the trend that increased chlorination and aromaticity tend to result in more negative property values, we can predict that the property value for this molecule will also be negative and likely in a similar range to the examples provided.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be approximately -0.85.

True Property: 0.4965886645823025
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a nitroalkane, specifically a nitropropane. It contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to a propyl chain (CCC). In the examples, nitro groups tend to contribute negatively to the property value, as seen in molecules like CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O (-0.91735322) and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (0.069531).

Additionally, the presence of a simple alkane chain (CCC) without additional functional groups typically results in a positive or slightly negative property value, as seen in CCC (0.49131435) and CCCC (0.2959952).

Considering these factors, the nitro group will likely have a more significant impact, leading to a negative property value. However, the simplicity of the propyl chain may moderate this effect compared to more complex nitro-containing structures.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around -0.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, which can be compared to similar structures in the examples.

1. **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: This molecule is a chlorobenzene with a bromine substituent, and its property value is 0.53168951.
2. **COc1cccc(Cl)c1**: This is a methoxybenzene with a chlorine substituent, and its property value is 0.75252182.
3. **COc1ccccc1Cl**: This is a methoxybenzene with a chlorine substituent, and its property value is 0.76556624.
4. **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: This is a dichlorobenzene, and its property value is 0.76924454.
5. **c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12**: This is a bromonaphthalene, and its property value is 0.1205577.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but with a fluorine atom instead of chlorine. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which might affect the property value. However, the presence of both halogens (F and Br) suggests that the property value could be in a similar range to the chlorobenzene with bromine.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be slightly higher than that of Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 due to the increased electronegativity of fluorine. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.55.

True Property: 0.912100060914353
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with a hydroxyl group, which is similar to a norbornane derivative. The presence of the tertiary alcohol group can influence the property value, as seen in some of the examples.

Looking at the examples, molecules with tertiary alcohols or similar bicyclic structures tend to have property values that are not extremely high or low. For instance, the molecule CCCCC(C)(C)O has a property value of 0.04163606, and CC(C)(C)CO has a property value of -0.53565578. These examples suggest that the presence of a tertiary alcohol group can lead to a moderate property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is likely to be around the middle of the range, not too high or too low. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 0.1.

True Property: -0.7684760439043733
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC) and a cyclic imide structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O). This structure is somewhat similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 0.00606422. The main difference is the presence of a sulfur atom in the example, which is replaced by a nitrogen atom in the target molecule.

Considering the structural similarity and the fact that the sulfur atom in the example might contribute to a slightly different electronic environment compared to the nitrogen atom, the property value for the target molecule is likely to be close to that of the example, but potentially slightly different due to the absence of sulfur.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 0.006, taking into account the structural similarities and differences.

True Property: 0.7878552719588536
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of 0.84244024. Both molecules contain aromatic rings and nitrogen heterocycles, but the example molecule has an additional aromatic ring and a more complex structure.

Given the structural similarities and the presence of aromatic and heterocyclic features, we can predict that the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C will be positive, but likely lower than 0.84244024 due to its simpler structure.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around 0.5.

True Property: -0.888425674387955
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate. It has a long alkyl chain (heptane) and an ester functional group. In the examples, we have:

- CCCCCCC(=O)OC, which is a similar ester with a slightly shorter alkyl chain, has a property value of 0.48603702.
- CCCCCCCCI, which is a long alkyl chain with an iodine atom, has a property value of 0.03493221.

The presence of the ester group in CCCCCCC(=O)OCC suggests it might have a property value closer to the ester example (0.48603702) rather than the alkyl halide example. The additional ethyl group in CCCCCCC(=O)OCC compared to CCCCCCC(=O)OC might slightly increase the property value due to increased molecular size and potential for interactions.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be slightly higher than 0.48603702. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.50.

To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is methyl benzoate, which is an ester. In the examples, esters and similar aromatic compounds with ester groups tend to have property values around the range of -0.2 to -0.6. For instance, CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 has a property value of -0.64560535, and CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.18773604.

Given the structural similarity of methyl benzoate to these examples, particularly the latter, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be close to -0.18773604.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.19.

True Property: 0.9147282583527475
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the overall molecular structure.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, also known as 1,3-butadiene. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons and molecules with conjugated systems tend to have property values around zero or slightly negative. For instance, the molecule CC/C=C/C has a property value of -0.01000519, which is a simple alkene.

Given the structure of C=CCC=C, which is a conjugated diene, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be close to zero, similar to other simple hydrocarbons and conjugated systems in the examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for C=CCC=C is approximately -0.01.

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.42796621341194374
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their properties. The examples include a variety of organic molecules with different functional groups and structural features, and their properties range from negative to positive values.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is tribromomethane, also known as bromoform. It is a small, halogenated compound with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples, halogenated aromatic compounds like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 have a positive property value (0.1205577), while other halogenated compounds like Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1 have a negative property value (-0.93162379).

Considering the high electronegativity and electron-withdrawing nature of bromine atoms, and the fact that bromoform is a simple, non-aromatic halogenated compound, it is likely to have a negative property value. The presence of multiple bromine atoms could further contribute to a more negative value due to increased electron-withdrawing effects.

Based on this reasoning and the trends observed in the examples, I would predict that the property value for BrC(Br)Br is likely to be negative, possibly around -0.8 to -0.9. Therefore, a specific predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br could be approximately:

-0.85

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 0.41039509.
- An amide linkage (N-C=O), which is present in several molecules with varying property values.

- An aromatic ring, which is common in many molecules with both positive and negative property values.

Considering these features, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage might contribute positively, while the chlorinated carbon and aromatic ring might contribute negatively. The balance of these features suggests a property value that is likely to be slightly negative or close to neutral.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around -0.2.

   - It has a chloro-substituted aromatic ring, similar to some examples with negative property values.
   - The molecule also contains a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen, which is present in some examples with negative property values.
   - The presence of a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C) is similar to some examples with positive property values.

2. **Comparison with Examples:**

   - Molecules with chloro-substituted aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2, have a property value of -0.06887955, which is slightly negative.
   - Molecules with heterocyclic rings containing nitrogen and oxygen, such as Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2, have a property value of -0.30174591, which is negative.

3. **Overall Prediction:**
   - Considering the presence of the amide group, chloro-substituted aromatic ring, and heterocyclic ring, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value.
   - The tert-butyl group might slightly increase the property value, but not enough to make it positive.

Based on these observations, I predict the property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C to be approximately -0.75.

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a chlorinated biphenyl ether, which is similar to some of the other chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.

From the examples, we can observe that chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values, especially when they contain multiple chlorine atoms. For instance, Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of 0.89785159, and c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2 has a property value of 0.8541338. These examples suggest that the presence of chlorine atoms on aromatic rings contributes to a higher property value.

Given that Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has three chlorine atoms and an ether linkage between two aromatic rings, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be positive and likely in a similar range to the other chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately 0.85.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC/C=C\C, we can look at the examples provided and identify similar structures and their associated property values. The molecule CC/C=C\C is a simple linear alkene, specifically 2-pentene.

In the examples, the molecule CC/C=C/C, which is 2-butene, has a property value of -0.01000519. Since 2-pentene is structurally similar to 2-butene, with just an additional CH2 group, we can expect the property value to be close to that of 2-butene.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C (2-pentene) is approximately -0.01000519.

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: -0.8622350990159452
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCCOCC is a linear chain with an ether functional group (R-O-R') and is relatively simple compared to some of the more complex structures in the examples.

Looking at the examples, simpler aliphatic chains and ethers tend to have property values that are not extreme (i.e., not very high or very low). For instance, CCC(O)CC has a property value of -0.86612721, and C (methane) has a property value of 0.71716261. The presence of an ether group (R-O-R') in CCCOCC might influence the property value to be slightly different from a simple alkane.

Considering these factors, CCCOCC is likely to have a property value that is moderate and possibly slightly positive or negative, but not extreme. Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be around 0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a tertiary amide with two phenyl groups and a tert-butyl group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 0.38841111. Both molecules contain a tertiary amide and two phenyl rings, although the example has an additional heterocyclic component.

Another similar example is Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl, which has a property value of 0.91180899. This molecule also contains an amide group and a phenyl ring, but it has a different substitution pattern and additional heteroatoms.

Considering these comparisons, the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to have a property value in the positive range, influenced by the presence of the phenyl rings and the amide group. However, the lack of additional heteroatoms or functional groups that significantly alter the property suggests a value closer to the lower end of the positive range.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be approximately 0.4.

Considering the presence of the bromobenzene moiety, which tends to have a positive contribution to the property value, and the acetamide group, which can have a neutral to slightly negative effect, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to be positive but not as high as the bromobenzene examples due to the influence of the acetamide group.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be approximately 0.65.

2. CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (0.49392036) - This molecule is propylbenzene, which is very similar to isobutylbenzene, differing only by the branching of the alkyl chain.
3. CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.80420966) - This is another isomer of propylbenzene, with a different substitution pattern on the benzene ring.

The most similar structure is CCc1ccc(C)cc1, which has a property value of 0.49392036. Given that isobutylbenzene is very similar to propylbenzene, we can expect the property value to be close to this. However, the branching in isobutylbenzene might slightly affect the property.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 would be around 0.49.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.9213541341480623
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:

1. Aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro groups) tend to have positive property values.
2. Aromatic compounds with electron-donating groups or without strong electron-withdrawing groups tend to have negative property values.
3. The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) in aromatic systems can influence the property value, often making it less negative or even positive, depending on the context.

Benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, but not as strongly as nitro groups. Based on the examples, aromatic compounds with carbonyl groups (like NC(=O)c1ccccc1O, which has a positive value) suggest that benzaldehyde might have a property value that is slightly positive or close to zero.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) would be slightly positive, around 0.05.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring, similar to some of the examples. The presence of the nitro group (N(=O)=O) and the heterocyclic structure can influence the property value significantly. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values, such as:

- OC(Cn1cncn1)(c2ccc(F)cc2)c3ccccc3F, -0.55120093
- CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, -0.60345836
- Clc1ccccc1, -0.88146129

Considering these examples, the presence of the nitro group and the heterocyclic structure in the given molecule suggests that it is likely to have a negative property value. Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.6. 

Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately -0.6.

True Property: 0.8820094397084011
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine (N-N) linkage. This structure is similar to the example N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 0.69332608. The main difference between the two structures is the presence of a double bond between the nitrogen atoms in the example, which is absent in the target molecule.

The removal of the double bond in the hydrazine linkage could potentially affect the electronic properties and the overall stability of the molecule. However, both structures share the feature of two phenyl rings, which contribute significantly to the property value.

Considering these similarities and differences, the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be close to that of N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, but slightly lower due to the absence of the double bond. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be around 0.65.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. 

Looking at the examples, we can see that cyclic structures, especially those with amide or carbonyl groups, tend to have property values that are not extremely high or low. For instance, the molecule C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1 has a property value of 0.62078243, and it is a cyclic structure with amide groups. Another example is O=C1N(COC(=O)CC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of -0.02436776, and it also contains cyclic amide groups.

Given the structure of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, which is a relatively simple cyclic structure with two amide groups, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is close to neutral, possibly slightly negative due to the presence of carbonyl groups which can contribute to a more negative value.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.1.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, which is a chlorinated aromatic compound. In the examples, we have several chlorinated aromatic compounds:

1. Clc1ccccc1Cl (1,2-dichlorobenzene) with a property value of 0.65488507.
2. Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (a more complex chlorinated aromatic compound) with a property value of 0.34783999.

The molecule in question, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is similar to 1,2-dichlorobenzene but with an additional chlorine atom, making it 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene. The presence of additional chlorine atoms generally increases the electron-withdrawing effect, which can influence the property value.

Given the examples, the property value for 1,2-dichlorobenzene is positive, and the more complex chlorinated compound also has a positive value, though lower. Since 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene is less complex than the second example but more chlorinated than the first, we can expect its property value to be positive and likely between the two examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is an alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically a diethylbenzene. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions tend to have positive property values, as seen in examples like CCCc1ccccn1 (0.22175714) and Nc1ccc(cc1)S(=O)(=O)c2ccc(N)cc2 (0.21892831).
- The presence of additional functional groups or heteroatoms can significantly affect the property value, often making it more negative.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a relatively simple aromatic compound with only alkyl groups and no additional functional groups or heteroatoms, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly positive, similar to other alkyl-substituted aromatics.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is approximately 0.22.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is a sulfonamide derivative, which contains a benzene ring (phenyl group) attached to a sulfonamide group. In the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (such as nitro groups) tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.28668502, and it contains a nitro group attached to a phenyl ring.

The sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is also electron-withdrawing, similar to the nitro group, and can influence the property value in a similar manner. Given the structural similarity to the example with the nitro group, we can expect the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O to be negative, but possibly not as negative as some of the more heavily substituted aromatic compounds with multiple electron-withdrawing groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be around -0.3. This accounts for the electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonamide group and its impact on the overall property value.

The molecule in question, COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, contains several functional groups: a phosphonate group (P(=O)(OC)O), a thioester linkage (SC), and an amide group (NC(C)=O).

From the examples provided, we can observe that molecules with phosphonate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl and COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, tend to have positive property values. The presence of a thioester linkage (SC) and an amide group (NC(C)=O) might influence the property value as well, but the phosphonate group seems to have a more dominant effect in the examples.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is likely to be positive, similar to other phosphonate-containing molecules. Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.7.

1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule has multiple aromatic rings, similar to several examples provided. Aromatic rings can contribute to both positive and negative property values depending on their substitution patterns.

2. **Amide Linkage**: The presence of an amide linkage (O=C-N) is a common feature in some examples, such as CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2 (-0.07091818) and O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 (-0.06446377), which tend to have property values close to zero.

3. **Chlorine Substitution**: The molecule has a chlorine atom on one of the aromatic rings. Chlorine substitution can have varying effects, as seen in examples like Clc1ccc(I)cc1 (-0.51480511) and ClCC#N (0.37058695).

4. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (OCC(O)CO) can influence the property value, as seen in examples like OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO (0.13357994).

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero. The presence of the amide linkage and the aromatic rings with chlorine substitution suggests a value that is not strongly positive or negative.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 would be approximately -0.1.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.8075244500354346
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a terminal hydroxyl group, making it a primary alcohol (1-pentanol).

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Linear alkanes and simple alcohols tend to have positive property values. For instance, CCCCCC (hexane) has a property value of 0.03493221, and OC1CCCCCCC1 (cycloheptanol) has a property value of -0.66994009, which is less relevant due to its cyclic nature.

2. The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) in alcohols generally contributes to a positive property value, as seen in the example of CCC(C)Cl (2-chloropropane) with a property value of -0.91091113, which is negative due to the presence of chlorine, a more electronegative atom.

3. The molecule CCCCCO is similar to the structure of a simple alcohol, and based on the trend of linear alkanes and alcohols, we can expect a positive property value.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for CCCCCO (1-pentanol) is likely to be slightly positive, similar to other simple alcohols and alkanes. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is often associated with polar and electron-withdrawing characteristics.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which can also contribute to polarity and hydrogen bonding.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which is common in many of the examples and can influence the electronic properties.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can add to the molecule's polarity.

From the examples, molecules with polar functional groups like sulfonyl, amide, and ether tend to have positive property values, especially when combined with aromatic rings. For instance, the molecule CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C has a negative property value, but it also has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that might contribute to its overall property.

Considering the balance of polar and non-polar characteristics in the given molecule, and comparing it to similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be slightly positive, reflecting the influence of the polar groups and the aromatic ring.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is approximately 0.15.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several functional groups and structural features that can influence its property value:

1. **Ester Groups (COC(=O))**: Esters are present in the molecule, which can contribute to a more negative property value, as seen in some examples like CCCCCC(=O)OC (0.38997628).

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The presence of a nitro group is known to significantly affect the property value, often making it more positive, as seen in examples like Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (0.50170033).

3. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: Aromatic rings are common in the examples and can contribute to both positive and negative property values depending on the substituents.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring (C1=C(C)NC)**: The presence of a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen can also influence the property value, often seen in examples with varying effects.

Considering these factors and comparing with the examples, the molecule has a combination of features that suggest a balance between positive and negative influences. The presence of the nitro group and ester groups, along with the aromatic and heterocyclic rings, suggests a property value that is slightly positive but not extremely so.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately:

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two amide groups and a cyclohexane-like structure due to the cyclization of the peptide bond. This structure is relatively polar due to the presence of carbonyl and amide groups, which can engage in hydrogen bonding and dipole interactions.

Looking at the examples, molecules with polar functional groups, such as amides and carbonyls, tend to have negative property values. For instance, molecules like ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O (-0.91273048) and CC(=O)C(C)(C)C (-0.90705354) have negative values, likely due to their polar nature.

Given the structural similarity of the diketopiperazine to these examples, particularly in terms of polarity and the presence of carbonyl groups, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for this molecule.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.8.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure, consisting of a chloroethane (ethyl chloride) group. In the examples, small and relatively simple molecules, such as CCC (propane) and Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene), tend to have negative property values. Additionally, molecules with halogen atoms, like Clc1ccccc1I and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, also have negative property values.

Considering these observations, it is reasonable to predict that ClCC will have a negative property value. Given the simplicity and small size of ClCC compared to the other examples, a value around -0.5 seems plausible, as it aligns with the trend observed for small, halogenated molecules.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCC is approximately -0.5.

- Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -0.79261959.

The presence of the pyridine nitrogen might slightly alter the property compared to a purely carbon-based aromatic system, but the overall trend with chlorinated aromatics suggests a positive property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl would be around 0.3 to 0.4. Therefore, a specific predicted property value could be:

The property values for alcohols in the examples are generally positive, indicating a trend where alcohols tend to have positive property values. The values also seem to increase with the branching and size of the carbon chain.

Given that CCCCC(C)O is a branched alcohol with a six-carbon chain, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be positive and likely fall within the range of the alcohols provided. Considering the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCC(C)O would be around 0.6 to 0.7.

   - ClC(=C)Cl (1,1-dichloroethylene) has a property value of 0.70419824.

2. The presence of multiple halogen atoms, especially chlorine, tends to increase the property value. For example:
   - ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl (carbon tetrachloride) has a property value of 0.62911245.

3. Aromatic compounds with multiple halogen atoms, such as ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2, have a property value of -0.81692263, but this is due to the complexity and the number of chlorine atoms.

Given that 1,4-dibromobenzene is a simpler aromatic compound with two bromine atoms, we can expect its property value to be positive and likely similar to other aromatic halogenated compounds. Considering the examples and the trend, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around 0.7 to 0.9.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately 0.8.

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: -0.8683914063858583
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1

This molecule contains:

1. Aromatic rings: Three phenyl rings, which are common in the examples.
2. Phosphoryl group: The presence of a P(=O)(O) group, which is not directly seen in the examples but can be related to other polar functional groups.
3. Alkyl groups: Methyl groups attached to the aromatic rings, which are present in several examples.

From the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and polar functional groups (like carbonyls, nitro groups, etc.) tend to have negative property values, especially when they are more complex or have multiple rings. The presence of the phosphoryl group, which is polar, might also contribute to a more negative value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be negative. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.5. However, this is a qualitative prediction and should be taken as an approximation.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.003237759638408553
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to be electron-withdrawing.
- An aromatic ring, which can contribute to stability and delocalization.
- A nitrogen atom in a piperidine-like ring, which can introduce basicity and potential hydrogen bonding.
- Two chlorine atoms, which are also electron-withdrawing and can affect the molecule's polarity and reactivity.
- A ketone group (C=O), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.

From the examples, molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (NO2) or multiple halogens (Cl, F) tend to have negative property values, indicating a certain electronic or steric effect that these groups impart. However, the presence of aromatic rings and certain functional groups can also lead to positive values, depending on the overall balance of electronic effects.

Considering the balance of electron-withdrawing groups (CF3, Cl) and the presence of an aromatic ring and a ketone, the property value is likely to be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O would be around -0.3.

True Property: 0.8089058850881218
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitrobenzene derivative with a methoxy group, which can be represented as a methoxybenzene (anisole) with a nitro group attached.

From the examples, we can identify some relevant patterns:
- Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have a positive contribution to the property value, as seen in O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O with a value of 0.74848297.
- Methoxy groups (OCH3) are present in CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2 with a value of 0.23678465, indicating a moderate positive contribution.
- Aromatic rings (phenyl groups) can have varying effects, but in the presence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro, they often contribute to a positive value.

Considering these factors, the combination of a methoxy group and a nitro group on a benzene ring is likely to result in a positive property value. Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 0.60181887. Both molecules are heavily chlorinated, which typically increases the electron-withdrawing nature and affects the overall polarity and electronic properties.

Given the structural similarity and the high degree of chlorination, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl will be in a similar range, likely slightly higher due to the additional chlorination and complexity.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately 0.65.

True Property: 0.21688372452252827
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. Esters generally have moderate to low polarity and can exhibit a range of property values depending on their specific structure and substituents.

Looking at the examples, we can find some similar structures:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, which has a property value of -0.80288149. This molecule is an amide with an aromatic ring, which might contribute to a more negative property value due to the presence of the aromatic system and the amide group.

2. CCC#C, with a property value of 0.26270348. This is a simple alkyne, which is less polar than an ester.

3. CCCCCC#C, with a property value of 0.59582938. This is a longer alkyne chain, which is also less polar than an ester.

4. CCCCCc1ccccc1, with a property value of 0.70030284. This is a long alkyl chain with an aromatic ring, which might contribute to a more positive property value.

Considering the structure of CCCOC=O, it is a small ester without additional polar or aromatic groups that might significantly alter its property value. Esters are generally more polar than simple alkanes or alkynes but less polar than amides or molecules with multiple electronegative atoms.

Based on these considerations, the property value for CCCOC=O is likely to be slightly positive, reflecting its moderate polarity as an ester. A reasonable prediction for the property value could be around 0.2 to 0.4.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCOC=O could be approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a long-chain ester, specifically a decanoate ester, which is similar to other aliphatic esters and hydrocarbons in the examples.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Aliphatic esters like CCCOC have a positive property value (0.44478121).
- Long-chain hydrocarbons like CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 have a positive property value (0.14561996).
- The presence of an ester group (C(=O)O) tends to contribute positively to the property value.

Considering these observations, the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is expected to have a positive property value due to its ester group and long aliphatic chain. Based on the trends in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.4 to 0.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 0.45.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and functional groups present in the molecule and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, tend to have positive property values (0.69640948).
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, tend to have negative property values (-0.44879158).
- Molecules with phenol groups, such as Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1, tend to have slightly negative property values (-0.08864293).
- The presence of chlorine atoms in aromatic rings can contribute to both positive and negative property values, depending on the overall structure.

Considering these factors, the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O has a combination of features that could lead to a positive property value, primarily due to the presence of the nitro group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group and often associated with positive values in the examples.

Based on these observations, I would predict a positive property value for this molecule, likely in the range of 0.5 to 0.7. Given the specific structural features and their influence, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is a nitrophenol, which contains a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) and a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring. In the examples, we have:

- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which is a nitrotoluene, with a property value of 0.52098862.
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, which is a chlorinated phenol, with a property value of -0.24248712.

The presence of the nitro group generally increases the electron-withdrawing character, which can affect the property value. The phenol group can also influence the property due to its ability to donate electrons through resonance.

Considering these factors and the examples, the property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is likely to be slightly positive, as the nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, but the hydroxyl group can moderate this effect.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be approximately 0.1.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. This molecule is a complex sugar, likely a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide, given its multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic acetal structures.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic structures, such as sugars, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, which is a simple sugar, has a property value of 0.6661397.

Considering the complexity and the number of hydroxyl groups in the given molecule, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be positive and potentially higher than that of simpler sugars due to increased interactions and complexity.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately 0.75.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.26270348439325075
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne. It has a terminal alkyne group (C#C) and a relatively simple structure compared to the other molecules listed. In the examples, simpler aliphatic hydrocarbons and those with fewer functional groups tend to have positive property values, often related to their hydrophobic nature and lack of polar or reactive groups.

For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO (a long-chain alcohol) has a property value of 0.83742011, and CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO (a similar long-chain alcohol) has a value of 0.84856223. These are larger and more complex than CCC#C but share the characteristic of being primarily hydrocarbon in nature.

Given the simplicity and non-polar nature of CCC#C, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value, though likely lower than those of the long-chain alcohols due to its smaller size and lack of additional functional groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around 0.5.

- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of -0.86616937.

The presence of multiple chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring generally contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in the examples. However, the phosphorothioate group can contribute positively, as seen in the example with a similar group.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be slightly negative, balancing the negative influence of the chlorinated aromatic ring and the positive influence of the phosphorothioate group.

A reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is a pyridine derivative with a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a hydrazine moiety (NN). This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2, which has a property value of 0.65284277. Both molecules contain a nitrogen-containing heterocycle and a carbonyl group, although the specific heterocycle and substituents differ.

Considering the presence of the pyridine ring, which is a common feature in several examples with positive property values, and the carbonyl group attached to a hydrazine, which might contribute to a similar electronic environment as seen in the example with a positive value, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value for this molecule.

Therefore, based on the structural similarities and the trends observed in the examples, I would predict the property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 to be approximately 0.65.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Considering the structural complexity, the presence of the phosphorothioate group, and the amide linkage, the property value is likely to be negative.
   - Based on the examples with similar features, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around -0.7.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule is approximately **-0.7**.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 0.8170066324465411
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group and an alkyne group. It shares some structural similarities with the following examples:

1. CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO, which has a property value of -0.36021171.
2. CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 0.46385478.

Both of these examples are polycyclic compounds with ketone and hydroxyl groups. The presence of the alkyne group in the target molecule might influence the property value, but the overall structure and functional groups suggest a property value in a similar range to the examples.

Considering these factors, I would predict the property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C to be approximately 0.45.

True Property: 0.6561722856351911
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like the one you've provided involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples given. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by factors such as the presence of specific functional groups, aromaticity, and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule you've provided, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and hydroxyl groups, as well as a furan ring. This complexity and the presence of oxygen-containing functional groups suggest a potential for a negative property value, similar to other complex polycyclic structures in the examples.

Considering the examples and the structural features of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.85. This is based on the presence of multiple oxygen atoms and the overall complexity, which tends to correlate with negative property values in the examples provided.

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.5651241180390203
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to some of the examples provided, such as:

1. Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (property value: -0.51477298)
2. Fc1ccccc1 (property value: -0.29197618)
3. Clc1ccccc1I (property value: -0.53411762)

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl has a phenol group (similar to example 1) and a chlorine substituent (similar to examples 2 and 3). The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) typically contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in example 1. The chlorine substituent, as seen in examples 2 and 3, also tends to contribute to a negative property value, though less so than the nitro group in example 1.

Considering these factors, the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is likely to be negative and somewhat similar to the values of the examples with similar functional groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around -0.5.

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -0.9192949218802875
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 contains:
- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C), which is a relatively small and polarizable group.
- An ester linkage (OC(=O)), which can contribute to polarity and potential hydrogen bonding.
- An amide group (NC(=O)), which is polar and can also engage in hydrogen bonding.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1), which is similar to some of the chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, especially on aromatic rings, tend to have negative property values (e.g., Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, -0.86616937).
- Molecules with ester and amide functionalities can have varying property values depending on the overall structure and other substituents.

Considering these factors, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and the polar functional groups suggest a property value that is likely negative, but not as extreme as highly chlorinated compounds without balancing polar groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around -0.5.

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 0.42829136093765746
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has:
- A hydroxyl group (OH) attached to a carbon that is also connected to three aromatic rings.
- Two of these rings are chlorinated phenyl rings, and one is a pyrimidine ring.

From the examples:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substitutions (like Cl) tend to have a range of property values, often negative.
- The presence of a hydroxyl group can sometimes increase the property value, but this effect can be moderated by other structural features.
- The presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles (like pyrimidine) can also influence the property value, often positively.

Considering these factors, the molecule has structural similarities to some of the examples with both positive and negative property values. However, the combination of multiple chlorinated aromatic rings and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle suggests a more complex interaction, likely leading to a property value that is not extremely positive or negative.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl would be around 0.15.

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.8939044716521132
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCOC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCCCOC=O is an ester, specifically a linear alkyl ester, similar to the example molecule CCCCCCC=O, which has a property value of 0.2959952. The presence of the ester functional group (OC=O) and the linear alkyl chain (CCCC) suggests that the property value should be in a similar range.

Considering the examples, linear alkyl chains and ester groups tend to have positive property values. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCOC=O is likely to be close to that of CCCCCCC=O.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O is approximately 0.3.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.8984584150733969
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we can look at the examples provided and identify similar structures. The molecule ClCCl is dichloromethane, a simple chlorinated hydrocarbon.

In the examples, we have:
- ClCCCl with a property value of -0.30639072.

ClCCl is structurally similar to ClCCCl, but with one less carbon atom. Given the trend in the examples, where the presence of chlorine atoms tends to result in negative property values, and considering the similarity to ClCCCl, we can predict that ClCCl will also have a negative property value, likely close to that of ClCCCl.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl is approximately -0.306.

Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: 0.6719897545397142
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methylphenol, specifically a cresol, which is a type of aromatic alcohol. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Aromatic alcohols, such as Oc1cccc(O)c1, have negative property values. The example Oc1cccc(O)c1 has a property value of -0.79733911.
- Other aromatic compounds with hydroxyl groups also tend to have negative property values.

Given that Cc1cccc(C)c1O is structurally similar to Oc1cccc(O)c1, we can infer that it will likely have a similar negative property value. Considering the slight structural differences, such as the presence of a methyl group, the property value might be slightly less negative than -0.79733911.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be approximately -0.75.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.769244538295572
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, we can analyze the patterns and trends from the given examples. This molecule is a dichlorinated biphenyl, similar to some of the other chlorinated aromatic compounds in the list.

From the examples, we observe that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have negative property values. For instance:
- Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.02427528.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -0.86616937.
- Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of -0.68589784.

The molecule in question, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, is similar to these examples, particularly the second one, which is a highly chlorinated biphenyl. Given the trend that increased chlorination and aromaticity tend to result in more negative property values, we can predict that the property value for this molecule will also be negative and likely close to the value of the second example.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is approximately -0.85.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.5675585566227802
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple alkene with a branched structure. It has a double bond and a methyl group attached to the main carbon chain. In the examples, alkenes and branched alkanes generally have positive property values, especially when they are relatively small and simple.

For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCCC=C (a long-chain alkene) has a property value of 0.81325683, and the molecule CC(C)=CC3C(C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc1ccccc1)c2)C3(C)C, which is a more complex structure with an alkene, has a property value of 0.83108545.

Given the simplicity and the presence of the double bond in isoprene, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value, but likely lower than the more complex or larger alkenes.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around 0.5.

Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.8984584150733969
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane), we can analyze the trends in the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, especially those with high symmetry or simple structures, tend to have negative property values. For instance, ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of -0.81813861, and ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of -0.93052975. These examples suggest that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms contributes to a negative property value.

Given that ClCCl is a simple molecule with two chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Considering the trend observed in the examples, a value around -0.8 to -0.9 seems plausible.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCCl is approximately -0.85.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.2649396322297237
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 (0.90440484) and Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (-0.24248712), tend to have positive or slightly negative property values.
2. The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) in aromatic systems, as seen in CC(=O)Nc1ccc(O)cc1 (0.83015518) and CC=C(C(=CC)c1ccc(O)cc1)c2ccc(O)cc2 (-0.27021486), can influence the property value, often making it more positive.
3. The combination of chlorine atoms and a hydroxyl group in Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl resulted in a property value of -0.24248712.

Considering these observations, the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, which is similar to Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl but with an additional chlorine atom, is likely to have a property value that is slightly more negative due to the increased electron-withdrawing effect of the additional chlorine.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl would be around -0.3.

True Property: 0.6561722856351911
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be quite complex, with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and a significant degree of oxygenation, which suggests a high degree of polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The presence of methoxy groups (OC) and hydroxyl groups (O) further contributes to its polarity.

In the examples provided, molecules with high polarity and complex structures, especially those with multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, tend to have positive property values. For instance, molecules like OCC(O)CO (0.89306062) and OCC(O)C2OC1OC(OC1C2O)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (0.73384731) have positive values, likely due to their high polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple polar functional groups in the target molecule, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. Considering the examples and the structural features of the molecule, a predicted property value could be around:

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.9314731866120622
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and functional groups present in the molecule and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A thioether group (CS-)
- A pyrazole ring (1,2,4-triazole-like structure)
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- An amine group (N)
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings and carbonyl groups tend to have a range of property values, often negative.
- The presence of bulky groups like tert-butyl can influence the property value, sometimes making it more positive.
- The presence of sulfur (as in thioethers) can also affect the property, but the examples do not provide a clear trend for sulfur-containing compounds.

Considering these factors, the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C has a combination of features that could lead to a property value that is slightly positive or close to zero, given the influence of the tert-butyl group and the heterocyclic ring.

Based on the analysis of the examples and the structural features of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be approximately 0.1.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.18773604058132815
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ester group (COC(=O)) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1). In the examples, we have a few molecules with similar features:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 has a property value of 0.6578602. This molecule is more complex due to the presence of additional functional groups like sulfonamide and a heterocyclic ring, which likely increases its property value.

2. CCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of 0.50975293. This molecule is a simple ester with a long alkyl chain, which contributes to a positive property value.

3. CCCCC(=O)OCC has a property value of 0.19879929. This is another ester with a moderate alkyl chain length, resulting in a positive property value.

Considering the structure of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, it is an ester with a benzene ring, which is somewhat similar to the third example (CCCCC(=O)OCC) but with an aromatic ring instead of an alkyl chain. The presence of the aromatic ring might slightly increase the property value compared to the aliphatic ester.

Based on these comparisons, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around 0.2 to 0.3. Given the examples and the structural features, I would predict a specific property value of:

0.250

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.9034726018696673
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom at the end. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Linear alkyl chains like CCCCCCCCO have a property value of -0.02778797.
- Aromatic compounds with halogens, such as Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, have a property value of 0.1205577.
- Simple halogenated compounds like CI have a property value of -0.78280876.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is similar to CCCCCCCCO in terms of being a linear alkyl chain, but with a bromine atom instead of an oxygen-containing group. The presence of the bromine atom, which is more electronegative than carbon, might slightly decrease the property value compared to a simple alkane.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be slightly negative, similar to CCCCCCCCO, but potentially lower due to the presence of bromine. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around -0.05.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 0.3181021493065627
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for carbon monoxide (CO), we can analyze the examples provided and identify patterns or trends in the data. The examples include a variety of organic and inorganic molecules with different functional groups and structural features, each associated with a specific property value.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is a small, non-polar molecule with no additional functional groups or complex structures. In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules, especially those with fewer functional groups or less complex structures, tend to have property values closer to zero, often negative.

Given the simplicity and small size of CO, along with the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is negative and relatively close to zero. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO is approximately:

-0.1
