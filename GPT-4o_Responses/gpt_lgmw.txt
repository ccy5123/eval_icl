SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -3.7641647332321133
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The molecule is a long-chain ester, specifically a decanoate ester. 

From the examples, we observe that:
- Long-chain hydrocarbons and esters tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCCCCCC(C)O has a property value of -0.40651912, and CCCCCCCC(C)O has a property value of -0.82880745.
- The presence of an ester group (as in CCCCCCCC(=O)OC) also tends to result in a negative property value, as seen in CCCCCCCC(=O)OC with a property value of -1.04096544.

Given that CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is similar to CCCCCCCC(=O)OC but with a longer carbon chain, we can expect the property value to be slightly more negative due to the increased hydrophobic character and molecular size.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be around -1.2.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -2.3097724326893294
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxo group and a nitrogen atom. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings and heteroatoms.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with chlorine substituents tend to have negative property values, such as Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (-0.45987854) and Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 (-1.74509905).
- Compounds with heteroatoms like nitrogen and oxygen in a ring structure, such as O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1 (-0.04311575), also tend to have negative property values.

Considering these observations, the presence of chlorine, the aromatic ring, and the heteroatoms in the given molecule suggest a negative property value. However, the specific arrangement and the presence of the oxo group might moderate the negativity compared to highly chlorinated or nitro-substituted aromatics.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around -0.5.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.37540651577611545
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite, which contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have negative property values. The presence of the nitro group, which is electron-withdrawing, tends to lower the property value.

Considering the examples and the structural features of CC(C)N(=O)=O, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be in the negative range. Based on the examples, a predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O could be approximately -1.5.

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 1.1381942340460152
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as functional groups, molecular size, and overall molecular geometry. The given molecule, CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple rings and carbonyl groups.

From the examples provided, it seems that molecules with larger, more complex structures and multiple rings tend to have negative property values, especially if they contain carbonyl groups or other polar functional groups. For instance, the molecule Cc1cc2c3ccccc3ccc2c4ccccc14 has a property value of -0.20547266, and C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13 has a property value of -0.96306466. These examples suggest that the presence of multiple aromatic rings and carbonyl groups can contribute to a negative property value.

Given the complexity and the presence of carbonyl groups in the target molecule, I would predict a negative property value. Considering the trends from the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value of CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO would be around -0.5.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.8096405401411433
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A difluorobenzene ring, similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.8960569.
- An amide linkage, C(=O)NC(=O), which is a common feature in several molecules but not directly comparable in the examples.
- A chlorobenzene ring, similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -0.92971337.

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like fluorine and chlorine generally leads to lower property values, as seen in the examples. The combination of these groups with the amide linkage suggests a property value that is likely negative and possibly more negative than the individual components due to the cumulative electron-withdrawing effect.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be around -1.0. However, given the complexity and potential interactions, a slightly more negative value might be appropriate.

Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately -1.1.

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 0.17242200828566182
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with a linear chain and a branching methyl group. 

Looking at the examples, we can find similar structures:
- CCCC(C)CO has a property value of 0.17242201.
- CCCCCO has a property value of 0.38892784.
- CCC1CCCO1 has a property value of 0.41735453.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is similar to CCCC(C)CO, but with one less carbon in the main chain, which might slightly decrease the property value. It is also similar to CCCCCO, but with a branching methyl group, which might slightly increase the property value compared to a straight chain.

Considering these comparisons, the property value for CCCOC(C)C is likely to be close to the values of these similar molecules. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C would be around 0.2 to 0.3. 

Given the examples and the structural similarities, I would predict the property value for CCCOC(C)C to be approximately 0.25.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with two carbonyl groups and a bromine atom. The presence of carbonyl groups typically contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in several examples. The bromine atom can also contribute to a more negative value, as halogens often do, but its effect can vary depending on the context.

Looking at the examples, molecules with carbonyl groups and halogens, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-1.05292195) and COc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (-0.77086304), tend to have negative property values. The presence of an alkyl chain (CCC(C)) might slightly offset the negativity, but not significantly.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O is likely to be negative, and I would estimate it to be around -1.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly indicating a measure of hydrophobicity, electronic properties, or another molecular descriptor.

Biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples provided, aromatic compounds with multiple rings or halogen substitutions tend to have property values around or slightly below zero. For instance, the molecule Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34 has a property value of -0.18369914, and it is a polycyclic aromatic compound.

Given that biphenyl is a simpler structure compared to some of the more complex polycyclic aromatic compounds in the examples, and considering the trend of property values for aromatic compounds, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl would be slightly below zero.

Therefore, the predicted property value for c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 is approximately -0.2.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a sulfur atom at the end. This structure is similar to alkanes, which generally have low or slightly negative property values in the examples given.

Looking at the examples, linear alkanes like CCCCCCC=C have a property value of -0.30732144, and CCC1CCCCC1 has a value of -0.00730849. The presence of sulfur, which is more electronegative than carbon, might slightly affect the property value, potentially making it more negative.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be slightly negative, similar to other linear alkanes with minor modifications. Therefore, I would predict a property value around -0.1 to -0.3. A specific prediction could be:

-0.15

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with a tertiary carbon center, similar to some of the aliphatic hydrocarbons and alcohols in the examples. Let's consider the following examples for comparison:

1. CCC(C)(C)C, which has a property value of 0.4167405.
2. CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O, which has a property value of -1.3403389.
3. CC(C)CC(C)O, which has a property value of 0.17242201.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is structurally similar to CC(C)CC(C)O, which is a branched alcohol with a property value of 0.17242201. The presence of the alcohol group (OH) and the branching pattern are key features that influence the property value.

Considering these comparisons, the predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is likely to be close to that of CC(C)CC(C)O. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO is approximately 0.172.

True Property: -0.7579098249579354
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is a naphthalene derivative, specifically 1-methylnaphthalene.

From the examples, we can observe the following:

- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a property value of -2.58465403.
- Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (another polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a property value of -1.33821392.
- c1ccccc1 (benzene) has a property value of 0.52481706.
- Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (a nitro-substituted benzene) has a property value of -0.59790281.

The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is similar to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, which has a property value of -1.33821392. However, Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is a simpler structure without additional substituents beyond the methyl group.

Considering the trend that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values and the fact that Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is a simpler structure than Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, we can predict that the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 will be slightly less negative than -1.33821392.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately -1.2.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: -0.2982425809164913
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic urea, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -8.72128431. The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the new molecule.

The addition of an alkyl chain generally increases hydrophobicity and can affect the overall property value, but given the significant negative value of the example, the impact might not be enough to shift the property to a positive value. The cyclic urea core, which is likely responsible for the large negative value, remains unchanged.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is likely to be slightly less negative than -8.72128431, but still significantly negative. A reasonable estimate would be around -8.5.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.8960569018545745
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group is known to be electron-withdrawing due to the high electronegativity of fluorine atoms. This can influence the molecule's properties, such as its polarity and reactivity.

Looking at the examples, we can see that molecules with halogen substituents on aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1 (-0.29424802) and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (1.2507042), have varying property values depending on the number and type of halogens present. The presence of multiple halogens tends to increase the property value, likely due to increased electron-withdrawing effects and changes in molecular interactions.

Given that trifluoromethyl is a strong electron-withdrawing group, we can expect the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 to be influenced similarly. However, since it is a single trifluoromethyl group, the effect might not be as pronounced as in the case of multiple halogens.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be slightly negative, reflecting the electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group on the aromatic ring.

Therefore, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.3.

3. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (C3(O) and C(O)) can increase the polarity of the molecule, potentially affecting its property value.

4. **Comparison with Examples**: The molecule CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which is structurally similar due to its polycyclic nature and presence of ketone groups, has a positive property value. This suggests that the given molecule might also have a positive property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C is likely to be positive and similar to the structurally related example. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 1.1.

This structure is similar to the example COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which has a nitro group on a benzene ring and a methoxy group, with a property value of -1.18700921. The acetamide group is less electron-donating than a methoxy group, which might suggest a slightly more negative property value due to reduced electron density on the benzene ring.

Considering the examples and the structural similarities, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O would be around -1.2.

Given the presence of a chlorine-substituted aromatic ring, we can compare it to examples like Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 (-0.719754) and Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (-1.71841599). The presence of the phosphorothioate group and the thioether linkage might contribute to a slightly different property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 is likely to be in the range of the chlorinated aromatic compounds, but slightly adjusted due to the additional functional groups. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.5.

The molecule CC(C)(C)CO is a simple alcohol with a tertiary butyl group, also known as tert-butanol. It has a branched structure with a hydroxyl group, similar to some of the other alcohols in the examples.

Looking at the examples:
- CCC (propane) has a property value of 0.9037335.
- CC(C)CO (isobutanol) has a property value of 0.57524162.
- CCCC(O)CCC (a longer chain alcohol) has a property value of -0.08598968.

The presence of the hydroxyl group generally contributes to a positive property value, but branching can affect the value. Given that tert-butanol is more branched than isobutanol, it might have a slightly different property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO (tert-butanol) would be around 0.5. However, due to the increased branching, it might be slightly lower than isobutanol's value.

Additionally, molecules with amide or urea linkages, such as CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1, have significantly negative property values, like -4.28674362.

Considering the structure of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, which contains two phenyl groups and a urea linkage, it is likely to have a negative property value. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -1.5 to -2.0, considering the influence of the aromatic rings and the urea linkage.

- A guanidine group (NC(=N)N), which is highly polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.

From the examples, molecules with similar functional groups and aromatic systems tend to have property values that are influenced by their polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. For instance:
- Molecules with sulfonamide groups and aromatic rings, like O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -1.04690952.
- Molecules with amine groups and aromatic systems, like NNc1ccccc1, have a property value of 0.06852515.

Considering the combination of these features, the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is likely to have a property value that reflects its polar nature and potential for hydrogen bonding, but not as negative as highly electron-withdrawing or halogenated systems.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 would be around -0.5.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.0261438122903352
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is often associated with negative property values in the examples.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which can also contribute to a negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
- An alkene group (C=C) and an amine group (CCN), which are present in some examples with varying effects on the property value.

Based on the examples, molecules with nitro groups and electron-withdrawing groups like trifluoromethyl tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.65797142, and Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl has a property value of -0.7680874.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be negative and in the range of similar molecules with nitro and trifluoromethyl groups. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.7 to -0.8.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.75.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.3895547479458299
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, an ester. Esters generally have moderate to low polarity and are often less polar than alcohols or acids. In the examples, similar molecules like CC(C)CCOC=O (an ester) have a property value of -0.08509586, and CCC(C)(C)O (an alcohol) has a property value of 0.38892784.

Given that CC(C)OC=O is an ester and considering the property values of similar structures, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC(C)OC=O would be slightly negative, reflecting its moderate polarity and ester functional group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O is approximately -0.085.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.21300292041459154
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the structures in the examples.

1. **Structural Analysis**: The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a phenol derivative with two methyl groups. The presence of the hydroxyl group (O) on the benzene ring suggests some level of polarity, which can influence the property value.

2. **Comparison with Examples**: 
   - The molecule c1ccccc1O (phenol) has a property value of 0.30112966.
   - The molecule Cc1cccc(N)c1 (aniline derivative) has a property value of 0.08629489.
   - The molecule c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC (a more complex phenol derivative) has a property value of -2.34325877.

3. **Prediction**: Given that Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a simple phenol derivative with additional methyl groups, it is likely to have a property value close to that of phenol (c1ccccc1O). The methyl groups may slightly increase the hydrophobic character, but the hydroxyl group will still dominate the property.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be slightly lower than that of phenol due to the additional methyl groups, but still positive. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around:

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.42179739769416924
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)O), which is present in several examples with relatively high property values, such as:

- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl: 1.28847968
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl: 1.59308821
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl: 0.91816815

These examples suggest that the presence of the phosphorothioate group contributes positively to the property value. Additionally, the molecule contains a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) attached to a phenyl ring, which are less electronegative than halogens and may contribute less negatively to the property value compared to the halogenated examples.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property value, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be positive and somewhat lower than the halogenated examples due to the less electronegative substituents.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is approximately 0.8.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples given.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with multiple chlorine atoms attached to the biphenyl structure. In the examples, we have similar chlorinated aromatic compounds:

1. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of 1.2507042.
2. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of 1.48651445.

The molecule in question has a similar structure to these examples, with multiple chlorine atoms contributing to its property value. Given the trend in the examples, the property value is likely to be positive and in a similar range.

Considering the structural similarity and the number of chlorine atoms, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be approximately 1.3.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.37540651577611545
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a nitroalkane, specifically a nitropropane. The nitro group (N(=O)=O) is known to be an electron-withdrawing group, which can influence the overall property value. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have positive property values, indicating a certain level of electron-withdrawing influence.

For instance, the molecule CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a property value of 1.04387435, and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O has a property value of -1.09358075. These examples show that the presence of nitro groups can lead to a range of property values, but they often contribute to a positive or slightly negative value depending on the rest of the molecular structure.

Given that CCCN(=O)=O is a relatively simple molecule with a single nitro group attached to a short alkane chain, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly positive or close to zero, reflecting the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group balanced by the alkane chain.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 0.1.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -3.0724821365389983
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, which is similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's consider the examples with similar structures:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of -2.69499739.
- COc1cccc(Cl)c1 has a property value of -0.77086304.
- COc1ccccc1Cl has a property value of -0.77086304.
- Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl has a property value of 0.5993873.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a halogenated benzene, similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but with a fluorine atom instead of a chlorine atom. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which could influence the property value. The presence of both fluorine and bromine might result in a property value that is somewhat between the values for Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 and the other halogenated benzene examples.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be around -1.5. This value takes into account the influence of the electronegative fluorine and the presence of bromine, which might slightly increase the property value compared to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group, similar to some of the examples given.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is structurally similar to some of the examples with bicyclic frameworks and alcohol groups, such as CC1CCCO1 (0.41735453) and CC(C)(C)CO (0.38892784). These examples have positive property values, likely due to the presence of alcohol groups and the overall structure.

Considering the structural similarities and the presence of the alcohol group, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 will also be positive and in a similar range to the examples mentioned.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is approximately 0.4.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC) and a cyclic imide structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O). This structure is somewhat similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 1.47723653. The main difference is the substitution of the sulfur atom (S) with a nitrogen atom (N) in the cyclic structure.

Considering the structural similarity and the fact that the substitution of sulfur with nitrogen might slightly affect the property, we can predict that the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O will be close to, but slightly lower than, 1.47723653.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is approximately 1.4.

True Property: -3.2589524104151164
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1C, which has a property value of -0.16965113. However, the presence of the carbonyl group and the nitrogen heterocycle in the target molecule could influence the property value.

Considering the examples, molecules with carbonyl groups and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values, often due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl group and the aromatic stabilization. The presence of nitrogen in a heterocycle can also contribute to a more negative value, as seen in some of the examples with nitrogen-containing rings.

Given these considerations, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is likely to be negative and somewhat similar to other nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds with carbonyl groups. A reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.5, considering the structural similarities and the influence of the functional groups present.

True Property: -0.8272509437569734
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which is a linear chain with a total of 9 carbon atoms.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCCC(=O)OC, which is a similar ester with a slightly shorter chain, has a property value of -2.63540538.
- CCCCC, a linear alkane with 5 carbon atoms, has a property value of 0.59947289.
- CCCCCCCCI, a linear alkane with an iodine atom, has a property value of -0.62531882.

Considering the structure of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, it is more similar to the ester example, but with a longer carbon chain. Esters tend to have negative property values in the examples provided, and the longer chain might slightly increase the negativity compared to the shorter ester example.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be slightly more negative than -2.63540538. A predicted value could be around -2.7.

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.5687917237021894
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is methyl benzoate, an ester with a benzene ring. In the examples, we have several molecules with aromatic rings and ester groups:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1: -1.9886694
2. CCOC(=O)c1cncn1C(C)c2ccccc2: -0.16233868
3. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1: -1.05665033

The third example, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, is ethyl benzoate, which is very similar to methyl benzoate, differing only by one carbon in the alkyl chain. The property value for ethyl benzoate is -1.05665033.

Given the structural similarity between methyl benzoate and ethyl benzoate, we can predict that the property value for methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1) will be close to that of ethyl benzoate. Since methyl benzoate has a slightly smaller alkyl group, it might have a slightly less negative value, but it should be in the same range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -1.0.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.647691958085121
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear conjugated diene, which is a relatively simple hydrocarbon structure.

From the examples, we can observe that simple hydrocarbons, especially those with conjugated systems, tend to have property values around the range of 0.1 to 0.6. For instance, the molecule C=Cc1ccccc1 (styrene) has a property value of 0.1389184, and CCC(=O)C (butanone) has a property value of 0.60000857. The molecule CC/C=C/C (2-butene) has a property value of 0.62379954.

Given that C=CCC=C is a simple conjugated diene, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would be in a similar range. Considering the examples and the nature of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C would be around 0.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for C=CCC=C is approximately 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is tribromomethane, also known as bromoform. It is a simple molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly bromine, tend to have negative property values. For instance, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of -1.38308213, and FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br has a property value of -2.03955211.

Given the simplicity of BrC(Br)Br compared to the more complex aromatic structures in the examples, we can expect its property value to be negative but not as extreme as those of larger, more complex halogenated compounds. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around -1.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 1.30194827.
- An amide linkage (N-C=O) within a cyclic structure, similar to the example CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O, which has a property value of -0.26496478.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is present in several examples with varying effects on the property value.

Considering these features, the molecule has a combination of electron-withdrawing groups and a cyclic amide, which tend to lower the property value. However, the presence of the phosphorothioate group, which is associated with a higher property value in the example, may counterbalance this effect.

Taking into account the structural similarities and the property values of the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 0.9.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A dimethylamide group (CN(C)C(=O)), which is present in the example CN(C)C(=O)C with a property value of 0.40349861.
- A chloro-substituted aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O with a property value of -1.40881767.
- A heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen, similar to Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2 with a property value of -1.27100203.
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C), which is a bulky group that can influence the property value.

Considering these features, the molecule has a combination of electron-withdrawing groups (chloro and nitro-like groups) and electron-donating groups (dimethylamide), along with a bulky tert-butyl group. The presence of these groups suggests a balance between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects, which can influence the overall property value.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, the predicted property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C is approximately -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with chlorine atoms attached to each ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, which has a property value of -0.45987854. However, the example molecule has more chlorine atoms, which generally increase the electron-withdrawing effect and could lead to a more negative property value.

Another relevant example is Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -0.719754. This molecule is a biphenyl with two chlorine atoms, similar to the target molecule, but without the ether linkage.

Considering these comparisons, the ether linkage in the target molecule might slightly reduce the electron-withdrawing effect compared to the fully chlorinated example, but the presence of chlorine atoms on both rings will still contribute to a negative property value.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be around -0.5. This value reflects the influence of the chlorine atoms and the ether linkage, balancing between the examples provided.

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 0.3889278361632943
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCOCC is a simple linear ether, specifically diethyl ether. 

From the examples, we can observe that small, simple aliphatic molecules with oxygen, such as alcohols and ethers, tend to have property values around the range of -0.1 to 0.5. For instance, CCC(O)CC has a property value of 0.38892784, and CC(C)O has a property value of 0.73876264. 

Considering the structure of CCCOCC, which is similar to these examples but slightly less complex due to the absence of additional functional groups or branching, we can predict that its property value will be in the lower end of this range. 

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be approximately 0.3.

The molecule in question is a tertiary amide with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 0.67485343. Both molecules contain a tertiary amide and two phenyl rings, although the example molecule has an additional heterocyclic component.

Another similar example is Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl, which has a property value of -0.7680874. This molecule also contains an amide group and a phenyl ring, but it has additional heteroatoms and a different substitution pattern.

Considering the structural similarities and differences, the predicted property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be closer to the positive range due to the presence of the phenyl groups and the tertiary amide, which are features associated with positive property values in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is approximately 0.5.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-), which is a common feature in several molecules.
- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1), which is also present in some of the examples.

From the examples:
- Molecules with bromine, such as Fc1cccc(Br)c1 and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1, have negative property values (-3.07248214 and -2.74056927, respectively).
- Molecules with an acetamide group, such as CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, have a property value of -0.27391417.

Considering these observations, the presence of bromine tends to lower the property value, while the acetamide group has a less pronounced effect. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to be negative, but not as low as the values for molecules with multiple halogens or other strongly negative features.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately -0.5.

- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (a dimethylbenzene) with a property value of -0.5137447

The structure of cumene is similar to ethylbenzene (CCc1ccc(C)cc1), but with an additional methyl group, making it more similar to a dimethylbenzene. The property value for ethylbenzene is -0.16965113, and for a dimethylbenzene, it is -0.5137447.

Considering the structural similarity and the trend in the examples, the property value for cumene (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1) is likely to be between these two values, but closer to that of ethylbenzene due to the presence of only one additional methyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is approximately -0.25.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.10460749795415054
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have more negative property values. For instance, NC(=O)c1ccccc1O has a property value of -0.59790281, and O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -2.16209103. On the other hand, aromatic compounds with electron-donating groups or less polar substituents tend to have less negative or even positive property values, such as COc1ccccc1 with a property value of 0.06859757.

Benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, but it is not as strongly electron-withdrawing as a nitro group. Therefore, we can expect the property value to be negative but not as negative as those with nitro groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) would be around -0.5. This is based on its structural similarity to NC(=O)c1ccccc1O, which has a property value of -0.59790281, and the fact that the aldehyde group is less electron-withdrawing than a nitro group.

True Property: -0.3012940762170303
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group and an oxazole ring. The presence of the nitro group (N(=O)=O) is known to often contribute to a more negative property value, as seen in some of the examples. Additionally, the presence of heteroatoms like oxygen and nitrogen in the ring can also influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups and heterocyclic structures tend to have negative property values. For instance, Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 has a property value of -2.30977243, and Cc2ncc1nccnc1n2 has a property value of -0.89762103. These examples suggest that the presence of heteroatoms and nitro groups can lead to negative property values.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is likely to be negative. Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -1.5.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -4.656305431896166
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, where two phenyl rings are connected by a hydrazine group (N-N linkage).

From the examples, we have a similar structure: N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -8.22209471. The key difference between the two structures is that the example has a double-bonded nitrogen (azo group), while the target molecule has a single-bonded nitrogen (hydrazine group).

The presence of the azo group in the example likely contributes to a more negative property value due to its electronic properties and potential resonance stabilization. The hydrazine group in the target molecule is less electron-withdrawing compared to the azo group, which might result in a less negative property value.

Considering these structural differences and their potential impact on the property, I would predict that the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is less negative than -8.22209471. A reasonable estimate could be around -7.5, reflecting the reduced electron-withdrawing effect of the hydrazine group compared to the azo group.

Therefore, the predicted property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is approximately -7.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a relatively small and rigid structure with two amide bonds and a cyclohexane ring. In the examples, similar cyclic structures with amide bonds, such as O=C1N(COC(=O)CC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (property value: 1.0705257) and O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC (property value: -0.62000871), show a range of property values.

Considering the structural similarity to these examples, particularly the presence of amide bonds and a cyclic structure, the property value is likely to be in a similar range. The diketopiperazine structure is more similar to the latter example, which has a negative property value.

Therefore, I predict the property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 to be approximately -0.5.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Clc1ccccc1Cl (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of -0.92971337.
2. Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (a more complex chlorinated aromatic compound) has a property value of 1.20198495.
3. Ic1ccccc1 (iodobenzene) has a property value of -1.55788738.

The molecule in question, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is similar to Clc1ccccc1Cl but with an additional chlorine atom and a biphenyl structure. The presence of additional chlorine atoms generally increases the property value compared to a single chlorinated benzene ring, as seen in the example with multiple chlorines.

Considering these factors, the property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is likely to be slightly higher than that of Clc1ccccc1Cl due to the additional chlorine and biphenyl structure. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.5 to -0.7.

Given these considerations, a specific predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl could be approximately -0.6.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- Cc1ccccc1N (aniline), with a property value of 0.08629489.
- CCc1ccccn1 (ethylpyridine), with a property value of 0.08629489.

Both of these molecules have aromatic rings with alkyl or similar substituents, and they have similar property values. Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is structurally similar to these examples, particularly in terms of having an aromatic ring with alkyl substituents, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be close to these examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is approximately 0.08629489.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is a sulfonamide derivative, which contains a benzene ring (aromatic) and a sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O). In the examples, aromatic compounds with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have negative property values, such as:

- Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12, -0.53938756
- COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1, -0.65002039
- Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, -9.45768596
- Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, -0.6276611

The presence of the sulfonamide group, which is similar in electron-withdrawing nature to nitro groups, suggests that the property value might also be negative. Additionally, the presence of the benzene ring contributes to the aromatic character, which is common in the examples with negative values.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be around -0.6, similar to other aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

In the examples, similar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54, have a property value of -9.53e-06, which is very close to zero.

Given the structural similarity and the planar, aromatic nature of triphenylene, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be close to zero. Therefore, the predicted property value for c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 is approximately:

Considering these structural similarities and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 is likely to be positive and in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 0.9.

To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)O), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (property value: 0.91816815) and CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C (property value: 1.19419101).
- An amide group (NC(C)=O), which is present in several molecules with varying property values, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (-2.31448943) and CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCCCC2 (-0.3471309).
- A thioester linkage (SC), which is not directly represented in the examples but is part of the phosphorothioate group.

Considering the presence of the phosphorothioate group, which tends to have a positive contribution to the property value, and the amide group, which can have a negative contribution, the property value is likely to be positive but not as high as the examples with more complex aromatic systems.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around 0.8.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.25734059185058733
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their properties. The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, relatively simple molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms often have positive property values, especially when they are part of aromatic or complex structures. However, simpler structures with chlorine, such as chlorinated alkanes, tend to have negative or small positive values.

Given the simplicity of Cl\C=C/Cl compared to the more complex chlorinated aromatic compounds, and considering the presence of two chlorine atoms, a reasonable prediction would be a small positive property value. However, since the molecule is not aromatic and is relatively simple, the value might not be as high as those for more complex chlorinated compounds.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around 0.1.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23, have a property value of -4.85718069, and CNc1ccccc1 (aniline) has a property value of 0.08629489. Pyridine is less complex than the former and lacks additional functional groups like the latter.

Considering the structural simplicity of pyridine compared to the more complex heterocycles and the presence of nitrogen, which can influence electronic properties, we can estimate that the property value for pyridine would be closer to that of simpler aromatic compounds with nitrogen.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccncc1 (pyridine) would be around -0.5.

- An ether linkage, similar to COC(C)(C)C (0.38892784).
- A pyridine ring, which is a heteroaromatic system, similar to c1ccc2cnccc2c1 (-0.3791994).

Considering these features, the molecule has a combination of aromatic, heteroaromatic, and polar functional groups, which generally contribute to a negative property value based on the examples. The presence of the amide and ether linkages, along with the chlorine-substituted aromatic rings, suggests a property value in the negative range, similar to other complex aromatic and heteroaromatic systems with polar groups.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 would be approximately -1.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the trends and characteristics of the given examples. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol with a five-carbon chain, also known as pentanol.

From the examples, we observe that:

1. Linear alkanes and simple alcohols tend to have property values around -0.5 to 0.5. For instance, CCC(C)Cl has a property value of 0.32442156, and CCOC=O has a property value of 0.57578709.

2. The presence of an alcohol group (OH) in a molecule like OC1CCCCCCC1, which is a cyclic alcohol, has a property value of -0.3554547.

3. The presence of halogens or other electronegative groups tends to decrease the property value significantly, as seen in molecules like ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl with a property value of -2.13759068.

Considering these observations, CCCCCO, being a simple linear alcohol without additional electronegative groups or complex structures, is likely to have a property value close to the simpler alcohols and alkanes.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be around 0.3.

The molecule in question contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is often associated with polar and electron-withdrawing characteristics.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which can also contribute to polarity and hydrogen bonding.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which can influence the electronic distribution and stability.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can add to the molecule's polarity.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with sulfonyl groups, such as CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C, tend to have positive property values.
- Aromatic rings can have varying effects depending on the substituents, but they often contribute to stability and can lead to positive or slightly negative values.
- Amide groups, as seen in O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC, can lead to negative values, but the context of the entire structure is important.

Considering these factors, the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is likely to have a property value that is slightly positive due to the presence of the sulfonyl group and the aromatic ring, despite the potential negative influence of the amide group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.2.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as functional groups, aromaticity, steric effects, and electronic effects. The given examples suggest that the property values are influenced by these factors, possibly related to solubility, polarity, or electronic properties.

The molecule in question, "COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C", contains several key features:
- An ester group (COC(=O)), which can contribute to polarity.
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is electron-withdrawing and can significantly affect electronic properties.
- Aromatic rings, which can influence stability and electronic distribution.
- A secondary amine (NC), which can also affect polarity and hydrogen bonding.

Considering these features and comparing them to the examples provided, the presence of the nitro group and ester groups suggests a tendency towards a more negative property value, as seen in some of the examples with similar functional groups.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule might be around -0.5. However, this is a qualitative estimate and should be verified with experimental data or more sophisticated computational methods.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two carbonyl groups (C=O) and a cycloalkane structure (CC1(CC1)), which is similar to some of the cyclic structures in the examples. The presence of carbonyl groups and a cyclic structure can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with cyclic structures and carbonyl groups tend to have a range of property values. For instance, the molecule ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of 1.01996761, and it contains carbonyl groups and a cyclic structure. However, the presence of chlorine atoms in that molecule likely contributes to its higher property value.

Considering the diketopiperazine structure, which is less complex and lacks additional electronegative atoms like chlorine, the property value is likely to be lower than those with halogen substitutions. Based on the examples and the structural features of the given molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.1 to 0.3.

Therefore, a predicted specific property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 could be approximately 0.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure, consisting of a chloro group (Cl) attached to a two-carbon chain (CC). In the examples, simple hydrocarbons like CCCCC have a positive property value (0.59947289), while aromatic compounds with halogens, such as Clc1ccccc1, have a slightly negative property value (-0.01389684). The presence of multiple halogens tends to increase the property value, as seen in Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (-0.97837341) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (1.2507042).

Given that ClCC is a small molecule with a single chloro group, it is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero, similar to Clc1ccccc1. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be around -0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a pyridine ring (a benzene ring with one nitrogen atom) and a trichloromethyl group attached. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 0.09613839. Both molecules have chlorinated aromatic rings, but the presence of the nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring could influence the property value.

Additionally, the example Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, which has a trichloromethyl group and a property value of 1.20198495, suggests that the trichloromethyl group contributes positively to the property value.

Considering these factors, the presence of the pyridine ring might slightly decrease the property value compared to a fully chlorinated benzene ring, but the trichloromethyl group will likely increase it. Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is likely to be slightly lower than 1.20198495 but higher than 0.09613839.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl would be approximately 0.8.

The molecule CCCCC(C)O is a primary alcohol with a five-carbon chain and a hydroxyl group attached to the second carbon, making it 2-hexanol. In the examples, similar alcohols and alkanes have been given property values. For instance:

- CCCCCCCCl (a seven-carbon chain with a chlorine atom) has a property value of -0.52577068.
- CCCCC(O)CCC (a seven-carbon chain with a hydroxyl group) has a property value of -0.08598968.
- CCC(C)CCO (a five-carbon chain with a hydroxyl group) has a property value of 0.17242201.

Given that CCCCC(C)O is similar to CCC(C)CCO but with a longer carbon chain, we can expect the property value to be slightly different but in the same range. The presence of the hydroxyl group generally increases the property value compared to alkanes.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCC(C)O would be around 0.172, similar to CCC(C)CCO, but slightly adjusted for the longer chain. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCC(C)O is approximately:

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have negative property values. For instance:
   - Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl has a property value of -0.719754.
   - ClC(Cl)Cl has a property value of -0.15209386.
   - ClC(=C)Cl has a property value of 0.25734059, which is slightly positive, but this is a small molecule with a different structure.

2. The presence of multiple halogens, especially bromine, might influence the property value. However, there are no direct examples with bromine in the provided data, so we can infer from the chlorine examples.

Considering these points, the property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to be negative, similar to other halogenated aromatic compounds. Given the pattern observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of 1,4-dibromobenzene would be around -0.5 to -0.7.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately -0.6.

The molecule in question is a chlorinated biphenyl, similar to the example Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 2.01540966. The given molecule has a similar structure but with fewer chlorine atoms.

Given the pattern observed in the examples, where the presence of multiple chlorine atoms tends to increase the property value, we can infer that the property value for this molecule will be positive and likely somewhat lower than 2.01540966 due to the reduced number of chlorine atoms.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately 1.5.

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 1.3056105311521413
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a triaryl phosphate ester, which includes:
- Three aromatic rings (phenyl groups), two of which are substituted with methyl groups.
- A phosphate group (P=O) with two ester linkages (P-O-Ar).

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and ester or phosphate groups tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl) or electron-donating groups (like methyl) can influence the property value, but the overall structure and functional groups play a significant role.

Considering these factors, the molecule has structural similarities to some of the examples with positive property values, such as:
- COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, which has a property value of 1.1315498.
- Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1, with a property value of 0.98640095.

Given the presence of multiple aromatic rings and the phosphate ester group, a positive property value is expected. However, the absence of strongly electron-withdrawing groups like Cl suggests a moderate positive value.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately 0.9.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.8244517303561575
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to be electron-withdrawing and can increase the lipophilicity of the molecule.
- An aromatic ring, which is common in many of the examples.
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle, which can influence the electronic properties.
- Two chlorine atoms, which are also electron-withdrawing and can increase lipophilicity.

From the examples, molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (NO2) or multiple halogens (Cl, F) tend to have higher property values, often positive. The presence of a trifluoromethyl group and multiple chlorines suggests a similar trend.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O is likely to be positive and relatively high. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction would be around 1.2.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.187009214980546
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring, with a nitro group (NO2) also attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can identify some relevant patterns:

1. Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have negative property values. For instance, O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -2.16209103.

2. Methoxy groups (OCH3) attached to aromatic rings can influence the property value. For example, c1ccccc1O has a property value of 0.30112966, indicating a positive influence.

3. The combination of electron-donating groups (like methoxy) and electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro) can lead to a balance in the property value, depending on their positions and the overall molecular structure.

Considering these points, the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has both a methoxy group and a nitro group on the benzene ring. The methoxy group is an electron-donating group, while the nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group. The presence of both groups suggests a potential balancing effect, but the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group is likely to dominate, leading to a negative property value.

Based on these observations and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around -0.5. This accounts for the negative influence of the nitro group, slightly offset by the methoxy group.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, which suggests it might have a property value similar to other chlorinated compounds. In the examples, we have:

- ClCC#N with a property value of 0.55808273
- ClCCCl with a property value of 0.22526068
- ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl with a property value of 0.58518588

These examples show that chlorinated compounds tend to have positive property values, likely due to their electron-withdrawing nature and the impact on molecular interactions.

Given the high degree of chlorination in the target molecule, it is reasonable to predict a property value in the positive range, similar to the highly chlorinated example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl would be approximately 0.6.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.3895547479458299
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with simple alkyl chains and functional groups like esters, alcohols, or simple halides tend to have property values around 0 to 1.
- More complex aromatic or heterocyclic structures, especially those with multiple functional groups, tend to have more negative values.
- Highly polar or charged groups can also lead to more negative values.

Given that CCCOC=O is a relatively simple ester with a small alkyl chain, it is likely to have a property value similar to other small, non-aromatic, and less complex molecules. For example, CCC#C has a property value of 0.80307832, and CCCCCC#C has a value of 0.47186926. These are small, non-aromatic molecules with simple structures.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be around 0.5. However, considering the specific nature of the molecule as an ester, which might slightly lower the value compared to a simple alkane or alkyne, a more precise prediction would be:

0.4

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -1.8042928637679125
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a simple ester, specifically decyl acetate, which consists of a long alkyl chain (10 carbon atoms) and an ester functional group.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with long alkyl chains, such as CCCCCCCc1ccccc1, tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 has a property value of -1.6950235.
2. Esters, such as CCCOC, have positive property values. CCCOC has a property value of 0.57524162.

Considering these observations, the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is likely to have a property value that is influenced by both the long alkyl chain and the ester group. The long alkyl chain might contribute to a more negative value, while the ester group might contribute to a more positive value.

Balancing these factors, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is likely to be slightly negative, but not as negative as molecules with only long alkyl chains. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately -0.5.

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with phenol groups, such as Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1, also tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of chlorine atoms in aromatic rings, as seen in several examples, often contributes to negative property values.

Considering these observations, the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of the nitro group, phenol group, and chlorine atoms.

Based on the trends from the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -1.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) and a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we have:

- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, with a property value of -0.59790281, which is a nitrobenzene derivative.

The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is similar to these examples as it contains both a hydroxyl group and a nitro group on a benzene ring. The presence of the nitro group, which is electron-withdrawing, and the hydroxyl group, which is electron-donating, can influence the property value.

Given the similarity to the example Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which has a property value of -0.59790281, and considering the additional influence of the hydroxyl group, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is likely to be close to this value.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. This molecule is a complex sugar, likely a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide, given its multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic acetal structures.

From the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic structures, such as sugars, tend to have negative property values. For instance, C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O has a property value of -1.05467949. The given molecule is more complex and has more hydroxyl groups, which could lead to a more negative value due to increased hydrogen bonding and solubility in water.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.8030783241448777
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCC#C is a simple alkyne, specifically 1-butyne, with a terminal triple bond.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Simple aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as alkanes and alkenes, tend to have property values around -0.1 to -0.7.
- The presence of a triple bond (as in alkynes) might slightly alter this range, but not drastically, as seen in the example of N#Cc1ccccc1C#N, which has a property value of -0.35344316.

Considering the simplicity of the molecule and the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around -0.3. This accounts for the aliphatic nature and the presence of the triple bond, which might slightly increase the property value compared to a similar alkane. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCC#C is approximately -0.3.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Functional Groups and Substructures:**
   - The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 1.30194827.
   - It also contains a chlorinated aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2, which has a property value of 0.49962833, and Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 0.09613839.

2. **Chlorine Substituents:**
   - The presence of multiple chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring is a common feature in several examples, such as Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl with a property value of -6.31841724, and Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl with a property value of 0.5692513.

3. **Overall Structure:**
   - The molecule has a combination of a phosphorothioate group and a chlorinated aromatic ring, which suggests a property value that might be influenced by both the electron-withdrawing effects of the chlorine atoms and the presence of the phosphorothioate group.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to the example with a phosphorothioate group and chlorinated aromatic ring. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately:

True Property: -0.5980219614079862
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is a pyridine derivative with a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a hydrazine moiety (NN). This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2, which has a pyrimidine ring with a carbonyl group and an amine. The property value for this example is -1.09720799.

Considering the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl group and the presence of nitrogen atoms in the ring, which can affect the electronic distribution, the property value is likely to be negative. The presence of the hydrazine group (NN) might also contribute to a more negative value due to its potential electron-donating effect, which can stabilize the molecule.

Based on these considerations and the similarity to the example provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be around -1.1.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and functional groups present in the molecule and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)
- An amide group (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Several alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, have a positive property value (0.40645532).
- Molecules with amide groups, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, have a slightly negative property value (-0.08517709).
- Molecules with piperidine rings, such as C/C1CCC(\C)CC1, have a property value close to zero (-0.00730849).

Considering these observations, the presence of the phosphorothioate group is likely to contribute positively to the property value, while the amide group and piperidine ring may have a neutral or slightly negative effect. The overall structure suggests a balance between these contributions.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value for CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C to be slightly positive, around 0.2.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.046505045766283254
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (octane), we can analyze the trends in the given examples. The examples suggest that aliphatic hydrocarbons, particularly linear alkanes, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCO (heptanol) has a property value of -0.08598968, and CCCCCCC1CCCC1 (a cyclic alkane) has a property value of -0.69460754.

Given that CCCCCCCC is a linear alkane with no functional groups that might significantly alter its property value, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be negative and likely close to those of similar aliphatic hydrocarbons. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC is approximately -0.1.

True Property: 0.8479899338228349
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as functional groups, ring structures, and overall molecular geometry. The examples provided suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the complexity of the ring systems.

The molecule in question, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, contains multiple cyclohexane rings, a ketone group, an alcohol group, and an alkyne group. The presence of these functional groups and the overall structure suggest a complex, polycyclic system.

Based on the examples, molecules with similar complexity and functional groups tend to have positive property values. For instance, molecules with multiple rings and oxygen-containing functional groups (like ketones and alcohols) often have positive values, as seen in examples like CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO, which has a property value of 1.46844111.

Considering these factors, I would predict that the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is likely to be positive and in the range of similar complex polycyclic structures. A reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 0.9.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and hydroxyl groups, as well as a furan ring. The presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (methoxy, hydroxyl, and ether) suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and increased polarity, which could influence the property value.

From the examples provided, molecules with high polarity or multiple electronegative atoms (like oxygen, nitrogen, or halogens) tend to have more negative property values, while those with less polarity or more hydrophobic character tend to have less negative or positive values.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen atoms, the property value is likely to be negative, but not extremely so, as the structure also includes aromatic and cyclic components that could moderate the overall polarity.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule might be around -0.5. However, this is a rough estimate and should be verified with experimental data or more sophisticated computational methods.

True Property: -0.36400637505025124
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of specific functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to some of the examples provided. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccccc1I has a property value of -0.29424802, and Fc1ccccc1 has a property value of 0.27048359. Both of these molecules are halogenated benzenes, similar to Oc1ccccc1Cl.

Additionally, the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, which is a nitrophenol, has a property value of -0.65797142. The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) in phenols tends to lower the property value compared to simple halogenated benzenes.

Considering these factors, the presence of both a hydroxyl group and a chlorine atom on the benzene ring in Oc1ccccc1Cl suggests that the property value will be somewhat negative, but not as low as the nitrophenol example. It is likely to be closer to the value of Clc1ccccc1I, but slightly more negative due to the additional influence of the hydroxyl group.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl is approximately -0.35.

- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C), which is a linear and polarizable group.
- An ester linkage (OC(=O)), which is polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.
- An amide group (NC(=O)), which is also polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1), which is similar to some of the chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, especially on aromatic rings, tend to have positive property values (e.g., Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl with 1.48651445).
- Molecules with polar functional groups like esters and amides can have negative property values, but the presence of chlorine can offset this.

Considering these factors, the presence of the chloroalkyne and chlorinated aromatic ring suggests a positive contribution, while the ester and amide groups might contribute negatively. Balancing these effects, the property value is likely to be slightly positive.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 is approximately 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has:
- Two chloro-substituted phenyl rings, which are often associated with positive property values in the examples.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2), which is a heterocyclic aromatic ring. In the examples, heterocycles like pyrimidine and imidazole tend to have negative property values.
- An alcohol group (OC), which can contribute to a negative property value due to its polar nature.

Considering these features:
- The presence of chloro-substituted phenyl rings suggests a positive contribution.
- The pyrimidine ring suggests a negative contribution.
- The alcohol group suggests a negative contribution.

Balancing these factors, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is slightly positive or close to neutral, as the positive contributions from the chloro-substituted phenyl rings might slightly outweigh the negative contributions from the pyrimidine and alcohol groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl would be around 0.2.

- CCCCC(=O)OCC, which is a similar ester with a property value of -0.08509586.
- CCCCCCC=O, which is a ketone with a property value of 0.20577762.

The molecule CCCCCOC=O is structurally more similar to CCCCC(=O)OCC, as both are esters. The difference is that CCCCCOC=O has one less carbon in the alkyl chain compared to CCCCC(=O)OCC. This slight difference in chain length might slightly affect the property value, but not drastically.

Given the similarity to CCCCC(=O)OCC, I would predict the property value for CCCCCOC=O to be close to -0.08509586. Considering the slight difference in chain length, a reasonable prediction would be slightly more negative, but still close to this value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCOC=O is approximately -0.1.

Given the trend that smaller, less complex molecules tend to have slightly lower property values, we can predict that ClCCl will have a property value slightly lower than 0.22526068.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be approximately 0.20.

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.21300292041459154
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methylphenol, specifically p-cresol, which consists of a benzene ring with a methyl group and a hydroxyl group attached.

From the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with phenol groups (aromatic rings with hydroxyl groups) tend to have negative property values. For instance, Oc1cccc(O)c1 has a property value of 0.03241073, and c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC has a property value of -2.34325877.
- The presence of additional alkyl groups (like methyl groups) on the aromatic ring can influence the property value, but the presence of the hydroxyl group seems to have a more significant impact.

Given that Cc1cccc(C)c1O is similar to Oc1cccc(O)c1 but with an additional methyl group, we can expect the property value to be slightly more negative than 0.03241073 due to the additional methyl group, but not as negative as the more complex phenol derivatives.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be around -1.058498, similar to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, which is another methylphenol derivative.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.5993872982373488
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule "Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl", we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a dichlorinated biphenyl, similar to the chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.

The most similar examples are:
1. "Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl" with a property value of 0.96427585.
2. "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl" with a property value of 1.2507042.

Both of these examples are highly chlorinated aromatic compounds, and they have relatively high property values. The given molecule has four chlorine atoms, similar to the first example, but it is less chlorinated than the second example, which has six chlorine atoms.

Based on this comparison, the property value for "Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl" is likely to be between the values of the two examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 1.1.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 0.6237995354646122
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple hydrocarbon with a branched structure and a double bond. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons and alkenes tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCC=C (a linear alkene) has a property value of -0.69460754, and the molecule CCCCCCCC (a linear alkane) has a property value of -0.04650505.

Given that isoprene is a small, branched alkene, it is likely to have a property value that is negative, similar to other hydrocarbons and alkenes in the examples. However, due to its smaller size and branching, the absolute value might be smaller than that of the larger linear alkene.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around -0.3.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.4340067123867674
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane), we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl and Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, tend to have positive property values. This suggests that the presence of chlorine atoms might contribute positively to the property value.

Given that ClCCl is a simple molecule with two chlorine atoms, it is likely to have a property value that is positive but not as high as more complex chlorinated compounds. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around 0.5.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -2.0337055360493883
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol. 

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (-2.03370554) and Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 (0.8517974), tend to have a significant impact on the property value, often making it more negative.
2. The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) in aromatic systems, as seen in CC(=O)Nc1ccc(O)cc1 (-1.09876606) and c1(OC)ccc(CC=C)cc1 (-0.97635523), also tends to contribute to a more negative property value.

Considering these observations, the presence of three chlorine atoms and a hydroxyl group in Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl suggests that the property value will be quite negative, similar to Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl would be approximately -2.0.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known molecules.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and hydroxyl groups, as well as aromatic rings. From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and ether linkages, such as Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2, tend to have higher property values.
2. The presence of hydroxyl groups, as seen in molecules like OCC(O)CO, generally contributes positively to the property value.
3. Complex polycyclic structures, such as CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O, also tend to have moderate to high property values.

Considering these factors, the molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 is likely to have a property value that is moderately high due to its complex structure, multiple ether and hydroxyl groups, and aromatic rings.

Based on these observations, I would predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately 0.75.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -1.0432485036620576
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) atoms, along with the tert-butyl group, suggests a potential for moderate hydrophobicity and some degree of polarity due to the heteroatoms.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar features, such as CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C, which has a similar heterocyclic structure and tert-butyl group, have a property value of 0.07439602. Another example, C1SC(=S)NC1(=O), which contains sulfur and nitrogen in a heterocyclic structure, has a property value of -0.48537589.

Considering these comparisons, the predicted property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is likely to be slightly negative, reflecting the balance between hydrophobic and polar characteristics.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is approximately -0.25.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -1.056650328028815
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ester group (CCOC(=O)) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1).

Looking at the examples, we can identify some similar structures:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 has a property value of 1.60363674. This molecule is more complex due to the additional sulfonamide and heterocyclic groups.

2. CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of -2.62385374. This molecule is a diketone with two carbonyl groups attached to a benzene ring, which is structurally different from an ester.

3. Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.59790281. This is a nitrobenzene derivative, which is different in terms of functional groups but shares the benzene ring.

4. CCCCC(=O)OCC has a property value of -0.40538357. This is a simple ester similar to ethyl benzoate but with an aliphatic chain instead of an aromatic ring.

Considering these examples, ethyl benzoate (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1) is an ester with a benzene ring, which is less complex than the first example and more similar to the fourth example. The presence of the aromatic ring might slightly influence the property value compared to the aliphatic ester.

Based on these comparisons, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around -0.4, similar to the aliphatic ester example. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

-0.40538357

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -4.23255134116811
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the size of the carbon chain, and the presence of halogens.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached. In the examples, we have:

- CCCCCCCCO, which has a property value of -0.08598968.
- CI, which has a property value of -0.74914335.
- Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which has a property value of -1.38308213.

The presence of a bromine atom generally tends to lower the property value compared to similar structures without halogens, as seen with CI and the aromatic bromine compound. However, the linear alkyl chain CCCCCCCCO has a property value close to zero, indicating that the chain length contributes to a relatively neutral property value.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be slightly lower than that of CCCCCCCCO due to the presence of bromine, but not as low as the aromatic bromine compound. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around -0.1.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.0158523462665452
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide), we can analyze the examples provided and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of organic and inorganic compounds with different functional groups and structural complexities. The property values range from highly negative to positive, indicating a diverse set of properties being measured.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is a small, non-polar molecule with a relatively high bond order, which typically results in a stable and low-reactivity compound. In the context of the examples provided, simpler and smaller molecules tend to have property values closer to zero, either slightly positive or slightly negative.

Given the simplicity and small size of CO, and considering the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO would be close to zero. However, since CO is a stable molecule with a strong bond, it might lean slightly towards the positive side.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CO could be approximately:

0.05
