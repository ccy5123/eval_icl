SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 1.075010624847764
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The molecule is a long-chain ester, specifically a decanoate ester. 

From the examples, we observe that:
- Long-chain hydrocarbons like CCCCCCC (hexane) have a positive property value (0.21335842).
- The addition of an ester group (as in CCCCCCCC(=O)OC) tends to increase the property value, as seen in CCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (2.64866233).

Given that CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is similar to CCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC but with one less carbon in the chain, we can expect a slightly lower property value than 2.64866233. 

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be around 2.3.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.3702912378258616
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxygen and a nitrogen atom. This structure is similar to some of the other aromatic and heterocyclic compounds in the examples, such as c1cncnc1 (-0.83256452) and Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C (-0.60584878).

The presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in several examples with chlorinated aromatics. However, the presence of heteroatoms like oxygen and nitrogen in a ring can decrease the property value, as seen in the examples with heterocyclic structures.

Considering these factors, the property value for Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is likely to be negative, but not as low as the most negative values in the examples due to the presence of chlorine, which tends to increase the value.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around -0.5.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7864606998094001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is isopropyl nitrite, which contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O).

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, tend to have negative property values. The presence of the nitro group, which is electron-withdrawing, likely contributes to this trend. Additionally, smaller hydrocarbons like CCC(C)CC have property values close to zero.

Considering these factors, the presence of the nitro group in CC(C)N(=O)=O is expected to result in a negative property value. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O would be approximately -0.8.

This molecule is a polycyclic compound with multiple rings and carbonyl groups, similar to some of the examples provided. Notably, it resembles the structure of steroids, which are known for their complex ring systems and specific functional groups.

Looking at the examples, the molecule CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C has a property value of 4.75187365. This molecule also has a complex polycyclic structure with carbonyl groups, similar to the molecule we are analyzing.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of multiple rings and carbonyl groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for the given molecule will be in a similar range to the example mentioned above.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO is approximately:

True Property: 1.5460571391309497
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

This molecule contains:
- A benzene ring with two fluorine atoms (similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of 0.32929308).
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N) connecting to another benzene ring with a chlorine atom (similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 0.65274663).

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like fluorine and chlorine, along with the amide linkage, suggests that the property value might be influenced by these features. The examples with halogens and amide linkages tend to have positive property values, often around 0.3 to 1.0.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be around 0.5. This takes into account the influence of the electron-withdrawing groups and the structural similarity to the examples provided.

True Property: -0.3446774870425529
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with a linear chain and a branching methyl group. It is similar in structure to other small aliphatic ethers and alcohols in the examples, such as CCCCCO (-0.63674738) and CCCCCC(O)CC (-0.00110657). These molecules have negative property values, indicating that the presence of the ether group and the aliphatic chain tends to result in a negative property value.

Considering the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is likely to be slightly negative. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.5, given the presence of the ether group and the small size of the molecule.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is approximately -0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with two carbonyl groups and a bromine atom. The presence of carbonyl groups and a bromine atom suggests that the molecule might have a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero, as seen in some of the examples with similar functional groups.

For instance, the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of 0.05545755, which is slightly positive. However, the presence of the pyrrole ring and additional carbonyl group in the target molecule might shift the property value slightly more negative.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O would be around -0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a physicochemical property such as hydrophobicity, solubility, or a similar characteristic.

Biphenyl is an aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of two phenyl rings. In the examples, aromatic compounds with multiple rings, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34 has a property value of 4.77171288, and c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 has a property value of 25.38169023. These examples suggest that the property value increases with the number of aromatic rings and the degree of conjugation.

Biphenyl, with two phenyl rings, is simpler than the more complex polycyclic examples but more complex than a single benzene ring. Based on this reasoning and the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around 2.5. This value reflects its intermediate complexity and aromatic nature compared to the examples provided.

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.4009544961479699
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the examples provided and identify patterns or trends in the data. The examples include a variety of molecular structures with different functional groups and sizes, and their associated property values.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a sulfur atom at the end. This structure is similar to the aliphatic hydrocarbons in the examples, such as CCCCCCC=C (1.46019719) and CCCCCCC(C)O (0.3521254). These examples suggest that linear or slightly branched aliphatic chains tend to have positive property values, with the value increasing with chain length and branching.

Given that CCCCCS is a linear chain with a sulfur atom, which is less electronegative than oxygen and does not introduce significant polarity, the property value is likely to be positive but not as high as the more complex or aromatic structures.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be around 0.5.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with a tertiary carbon attached to an alcohol group. This structure is similar to the example CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O, which has a property value of 0.08226902. Both molecules have a tertiary alcohol group, which is a significant structural feature.

Considering the similarity in structure, particularly the presence of a tertiary alcohol group, the predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO would be close to that of CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO is approximately 0.08.

True Property: 0.8548336723726759
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is 9-methylfluorene, which is an aromatic hydrocarbon with a methyl group attached to a fluorene structure.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic hydrocarbons with additional ring structures or substituents tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 has a property value of 3.27006072, and Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 has a property value of 1.32720293. Both of these molecules have multiple aromatic rings and additional substituents.

The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is similar to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, which has a property value of 1.32720293, but without the additional methyl group on the second ring. Given this structural similarity, we can expect the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 to be somewhat close to that of Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, but likely slightly lower due to the absence of the additional methyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 would be around 1.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a cyclic compound with a diketopiperazine core, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -0.93267329. The main difference between the two structures is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the new molecule.

The addition of an alkyl chain generally increases hydrophobicity, which can affect the property value. However, the overall structure and functional groups remain similar, suggesting that the property value will not deviate significantly from the example.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is likely to be slightly less negative than -0.93267329, due to the increased hydrophobicity from the additional alkyl chain.

A reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately -0.85.

True Property: 0.32929308105682087
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group is significant because it is highly electronegative and can influence the molecule's properties, such as its electronic and steric effects.

Looking at the examples, we see that molecules with halogen substitutions on aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1 (0.59335903) and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (32.67306934), tend to have positive property values. The trifluoromethyl group is similar in its electron-withdrawing nature to halogens, which suggests that the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 might also be positive.

Considering the examples and the nature of the trifluoromethyl group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around 0.5. This value reflects the influence of the trifluoromethyl group on the benzene ring, similar to the effect seen with other halogenated aromatic compounds.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a sugar alcohol, specifically a form of glucose, which is highly polar due to the presence of multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups. This high polarity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups suggest that the molecule is likely to have a negative property value, similar to other highly polar and hydrophilic molecules in the examples.

Looking at the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a property value of -1.13569008. Given the structural similarity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O will also be negative and close to this value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately -1.1.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C

This molecule is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Cyclic Structure**: The molecule has a polycyclic structure similar to some of the examples provided, such as CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of 5.24248524. This suggests that complex cyclic structures with multiple rings tend to have higher property values.

2. **Functional Groups**: The presence of ketone groups (C=O) and an ester group (CC(=O)O) can influence the property value. In the examples, molecules with ketone groups, such as CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, have a property value of -0.2317615, indicating that ketones alone might not significantly increase the property value.

3. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (C3(O) and C(O)) can also affect the property value. In the examples, molecules with hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a negative property value of -1.13569008, suggesting that hydroxyl groups might lower the property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule in question has a complex polycyclic structure with multiple functional groups, including ketones, an ester, and hydroxyl groups. The combination of these features suggests a property value that is likely positive but not as high as the most complex cyclic structures without hydroxyl groups.

Based on the analysis and comparison with the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately:

It resembles some of the more complex structures in the examples, such as CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 1.60039044. This suggests that the presence of multiple rings and an alcohol group tends to increase the property value.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of the alcohol group, which can contribute to the property value, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O would be around 1.5. This is based on the similarity to the example with a similar structure and the presence of functional groups that influence the property value.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is an acetanilide derivative with a nitro group attached to the aromatic ring. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those containing aromatic rings with nitro groups and carbonyl functionalities.

From the examples:
- O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.46116459.
- COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.45706544.

Both of these examples have nitro groups attached to aromatic rings, similar to the target molecule. The presence of the acetamide group (CC(=O)N-) in the target molecule might slightly influence the property value, but it is reasonable to assume that the effect will not be drastically different from the examples with nitrobenzene derivatives.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is likely to be close to the values of the similar structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately -0.45.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)SC)
- A chloro-substituted aromatic ring
- A heterocyclic structure with a naphthyridine-like core

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with chloro-substituted aromatic rings tend to have higher property values, often positive (e.g., Clc1cccc2ccccc12 with 1.39009646, Clc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1 with 1.67221543).
- Molecules with heterocyclic structures and additional functional groups like carbonyls or nitro groups can have varying property values, often influenced by the presence of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups.

Given the presence of a chloro-substituted aromatic ring and a heterocyclic structure, the property value is likely to be positive. However, the presence of the phosphorothioate group, which is less common in the examples, might moderate the value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be around 0.5.

True Property: -0.6854768562811361
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CC(C)(C)CO is a simple alcohol, specifically tert-butanol, which is a branched alcohol with a tertiary carbon.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Simple alcohols like CCC(C)O (isobutanol) have a property value of -0.79564301.
- Linear alcohols like CCCCCCCC(C)O (octanol) have a property value of 0.3521254.
- The presence of branching, as seen in isobutanol, tends to result in a more negative property value compared to linear alcohols.

Given that tert-butanol is more branched than isobutanol, we can expect its property value to be similar or slightly more negative than that of isobutanol. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO would be around -0.8.

Thus, the predicted property value for CC(C)(C)CO is approximately -0.8.

Given the structural similarity to these examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 will also be negative. Considering the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.9.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is approximately -0.9.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.8117550263559526
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, an ester.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Small aliphatic alcohols and esters tend to have negative property values. For instance, CC(C)O (isopropanol) has a property value of -0.85176181, and CC(O)C(C)(C)C (a tertiary alcohol) has a property value of -0.54228046.
2. Esters like CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C have a positive value (5.24248524), but this is a large, complex ester. Smaller esters like CCC(C)C(=O)C have negative values (-0.44835897).

Given that CC(C)OC=O is a small ester, similar to the smaller alcohols and esters with negative values, we can predict that its property value will also be negative. Considering the trend and the structural similarity to other small esters and alcohols, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around -0.5.

True Property: 1.1220520465459547
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 is a symmetrical structure with two phenyl rings connected by a urea linkage. This structure is similar to other aromatic compounds in the examples, particularly those with amide or urea linkages.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro groups) tend to have more negative property values.
- Aromatic compounds with electron-donating groups or less polar groups tend to have less negative or positive property values.
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings generally increases the property value, especially if they are fused or linked in a way that enhances conjugation.

Given these observations, the molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 has two phenyl rings and a urea linkage, which is less polar than nitro groups but more polar than simple hydrocarbons. The structure is somewhat similar to NC(=O)c1cccnc1, which has a property value of -0.89183448, but the additional phenyl ring in our target molecule could increase the property value due to increased conjugation and aromaticity.

Considering these factors, I would predict the property value for O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 to be around -0.5. This accounts for the increased aromatic character and the presence of the urea linkage, which is less polar than nitro groups but more polar than simple hydrocarbons.

To predict the property value for the molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The given molecule is triphenylene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a planar structure consisting of four fused benzene rings.

From the examples, we observe that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1, which is a larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a property value of 6.73316002. Another example, Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, which is a chlorinated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a property value of 12.67911431.

Given that triphenylene is smaller than the largest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon in the examples but still significant in size, we can predict that its property value will be lower than 6.73316002 but still positive and relatively high compared to simpler aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (triphenylene) would be around 4.5.

- A sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N), which is known to be polar and can contribute to a lower property value.
- An aromatic ring (phenyl group) with an amine substituent, which can also contribute to polarity.
- An additional amine group attached to the sulfonamide, further increasing polarity.

From the examples, molecules with polar functional groups, such as amines, carbonyls, and sulfonamides, tend to have lower property values. For instance:
- Molecules with sulfonamide groups, like O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.80865785.
- Molecules with amine groups, like CNN, have a property value of -1.03150016.

Considering these observations, the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is expected to have a relatively low property value due to its polar functional groups. Based on the trends from the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.8 to -1.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is approximately -0.9.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 2.2632794985185316
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with negative property values.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which is also present in some examples with negative property values.
- An alkene group (C=C) in the side chain, which is not very common in the examples but can contribute to the overall property.

Based on the examples, molecules with nitro groups and trifluoromethyl groups tend to have negative property values. The presence of these groups suggests that the property value for this molecule is likely to be negative.

Considering the structural similarities and the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.5. However, given the complexity and the specific combination of functional groups, a more precise prediction would be -0.487.

True Property: -0.8117550263559526
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl acetate, an ester. In the examples, esters and similar functional groups tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCC(C)(C)O has a property value of -0.63731524, and CC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of -0.6235863. Both of these molecules contain ester or similar functional groups and have negative values.

Given the structural similarity of CC(C)OC=O to these examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC(C)OC=O will also be negative and likely in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O is approximately -0.63.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the other aromatic compounds in the examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is structurally similar to c1ccccc1O (phenol), which has a property value of -0.55107342. The presence of additional methyl groups in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 could slightly increase the property value due to increased hydrophobicity and molecular size, as seen in other examples where additional alkyl groups tend to increase the property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be slightly higher than that of phenol. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.45.

True Property: 1.6076035119145027
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is present in several examples with relatively high property values, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl (4.46982323) and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl (3.8937364). These examples also contain halogenated aromatic rings, which contribute to the higher property values.

The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) on the aromatic ring, which are less electron-withdrawing compared to halogens. This suggests a lower property value compared to the halogenated examples.

Considering the structural similarities and differences, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be lower than the halogenated examples but still positive due to the presence of the phosphorothioate group.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is approximately 2.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples given.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with multiple chlorine atoms attached to two connected benzene rings. In the examples, highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have high property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 32.67306934, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 51.74268014.

Given the structure of the molecule in question, it is likely to have a high property value due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and the aromatic nature of the compound. Based on the trend observed in the examples, I would predict a property value in the range of these highly chlorinated compounds.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately 30.0.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7860562002335568
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group attached to the terminal carbon. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Simple aliphatic chains like CCC (propane) have a property value of -0.54101993.
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, have negative property values, like -0.54316128.

The presence of the nitro group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, tends to lower the property value, as seen in the examples. Given that CCCN(=O)=O is a relatively simple molecule with a single nitro group, we can expect its property value to be slightly more negative than that of propane (CCC) due to the influence of the nitro group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around -0.6.

True Property: 0.21485805104541372
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, which is similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's consider the examples with similar structures:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of 0.79291214. This molecule is a chlorobenzene with a bromine substituent.
- c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12 has a property value of 1.58740927. This is a brominated biphenyl structure.

The presence of halogens (like Cl, Br, F) tends to increase the property value, as seen in the examples. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine and bromine, which might slightly affect the property value.

Given the structure Fc1cccc(Br)c1, which is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, we can expect the property value to be somewhat similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but potentially slightly higher due to the presence of fluorine.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be around 0.8 to 1.0. A specific prediction could be approximately 0.9, considering the influence of the fluorine atom.

True Property: -0.10951612081830257
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with an additional hydroxyl group. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with bicyclic frameworks and alcohol groups.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Bicyclic structures with alcohol groups, such as CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO, have a property value of -0.30237904.
- Other alcohol-containing compounds, like CCCCCCCCC(C)O, have a positive property value of 1.41583142, but this is due to the long alkyl chain.

Given the compact bicyclic structure and the presence of a hydroxyl group, the property value is likely to be negative, similar to other small bicyclic alcohols. However, the absence of additional functional groups that significantly alter the property suggests a value closer to zero but still negative.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is approximately -0.3.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)
- An amide linkage (N2C(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)

Comparing this structure to the examples:
- The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O has a similar phosphorothioate group and an amide linkage, with a property value of 2.15734629.
- The presence of a phenyl ring is common in several examples, often contributing to a moderate property value.

Given the structural similarities, particularly with the phosphorothioate and amide linkage, the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is likely to be close to that of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, but potentially slightly lower due to the absence of additional substituents like the chloro group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be approximately 1.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of 0.66409181. Both molecules contain aromatic rings and nitrogen heterocycles, but the example molecule has an additional aromatic ring and a more complex structure.

Given the structural similarities and the presence of aromatic and heterocyclic features, the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is likely to be in a similar range but slightly lower due to its simpler structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be approximately 0.5.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.15413595076233744
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which is a linear chain with a total of 9 carbon atoms.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCCCCCI, which has a property value of 1.21945678. This is a linear chain with an iodine atom, which is a heavy atom contributing to a higher property value.
- CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which has a property value of 0.55243758. This is a linear chain ester with a total of 10 carbon atoms.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar to CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC but with one less carbon atom in the chain, which might slightly reduce the property value. However, it is still an ester, and the presence of the ester functional group tends to increase the property value compared to simple alkanes.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would likely be slightly lower than 0.55243758 but still positive due to the ester group. A reasonable estimate would be around 0.4 to 0.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 0.45.

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.5166154810444945
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is methyl benzoate, which is an ester derived from benzoic acid.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Esters like CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 have a property value of -0.47336498.
2. The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, which is ethyl benzoate, has a property value of -0.32108879.

Given that methyl benzoate is structurally similar to ethyl benzoate but with a slightly smaller alkyl group, we can expect its property value to be close to that of ethyl benzoate. The presence of the ester functional group and the aromatic ring suggests a property value in the negative range, similar to other esters and aromatic compounds in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate) would be slightly more negative than that of ethyl benzoate, due to the smaller size of the methyl group compared to the ethyl group. A predicted value could be around -0.35.

True Property: -0.38414059979473925
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the overall molecular structure.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, also known as 1,3-butadiene. It is a relatively simple molecule compared to the others listed, which include more complex functional groups and ring structures.

From the examples, we can observe that simple hydrocarbons and molecules with fewer functional groups tend to have property values closer to zero, often slightly negative or positive. For instance, CC/C=C/C has a property value of -0.25633754, and C1CCCC1 has a property value of -0.26977468.

Given the structure of C=CCC=C and its similarity to these simpler hydrocarbons, we can predict that its property value will also be close to zero, likely slightly negative due to the presence of double bonds which might slightly lower the value compared to saturated hydrocarbons.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C is approximately -0.2.

True Property: 0.09521158786500165
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular size and complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is tribromomethane, also known as bromoform. It is a small, simple molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples provided, molecules with multiple halogen atoms, especially bromine, tend to have higher property values. For instance, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of 1.58740927, and Ic1cccc2ccccc12 has a property value of 1.30649575. These examples suggest that the presence of multiple halogen atoms, particularly heavier halogens like bromine and iodine, contributes to a higher property value.

Given that BrC(Br)Br is a small molecule with three bromine atoms, we can expect its property value to be relatively high compared to simpler molecules with fewer or lighter halogens. However, it is likely to be lower than the values for larger aromatic systems with halogens, such as the examples mentioned above.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around 1.5.

- A thioester linkage (SC(CCl)), which is not directly present in the examples but can be considered similar to other sulfur-containing groups.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is present in several examples with varying effects on the property value.
- A bicyclic structure with a benzene ring and a lactam (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O), similar to the example CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O, which has a property value of 0.26430629.

Considering these features, the molecule has a combination of electron-withdrawing groups (chlorine, carbonyls) and a phosphorothioate group, which tends to increase the property value. The presence of aromatic rings and a lactam structure also suggests a moderate to high property value.

Based on these observations and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 2.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**: 
   - The molecule contains an amide group (N(C)C(=O)N), a chloro-substituted aromatic ring, a nitro group (n2nc(oc2=O)), and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C).
   - The presence of a chloro-substituted aromatic ring is similar to some examples with positive property values, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 (4.5022484) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (3.26636789).
   - The nitro group and amide linkage are typically associated with negative property values, as seen in examples like CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C (-0.88281757) and O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-0.50345007).

2. **Overall Structure**:
   - The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that can contribute to both positive and negative property values.
   - The presence of a tert-butyl group can increase the property value due to its hydrophobic nature, as seen in some examples with positive values.

3. **Balancing Factors**:
   - The combination of electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and chloro) and the hydrophobic tert-butyl group suggests a balance between positive and negative contributions.
   - The overall complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups suggest a property value that is not extremely high or low.

Based on these considerations, the predicted property value for CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C is likely to be slightly positive, reflecting the balance of structural features.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with three chlorine atoms attached to the rings. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings tend to have higher property values. For instance:
- c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2 has a property value of 2.46256745.
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 2.45959785.
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 has a property value of 4.5022484.

Given the structural similarity and the presence of multiple chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl will be relatively high, similar to the examples with multiple chlorines and aromatic rings.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is approximately 3.5.

In the examples, the molecule CC/C=C/C, which is also 2-butene, has a property value of -0.25633754. Since CC/C=C\C is essentially the same molecule (just with a different stereochemistry notation), it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC/C=C\C would be very similar, if not identical.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C is approximately -0.25633754.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCCOCC is a linear chain with an ether functional group, similar to some of the examples given.

Looking at the examples, we notice that simple aliphatic chains with oxygen-containing functional groups, such as ethers and esters, tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCC(O)CC has a property value of -0.63731524, and CC(C)COC(=O)C has a property value of -0.6235863. These examples suggest that the presence of an ether group in a relatively simple aliphatic chain tends to result in a negative property value.

Given the structure of CCCOCC, which is a simple ether, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and likely in a similar range to the examples provided. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be approximately -0.6.

To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

This molecule is a tertiary amide with two phenyl rings and a tert-butyl group. The presence of aromatic rings and the amide functional group suggests that the property value might be influenced by these features. In the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and amide groups tend to have property values around the range of -0.5 to 1.5, depending on the specific structure and substituents.

For instance, the molecule CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 has a property value of 1.13377077, and it also contains aromatic rings and an amide group. Another example, Nc1cccc2ccccc12, has a property value of 0.06753379, which is lower but still positive, and it also contains aromatic rings.

Considering the structure of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has two phenyl rings and a tert-butyl group, it is likely to have a property value in the positive range, similar to the examples with aromatic rings and amide groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be around 0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is an acetanilide derivative with a bromine substituent on the phenyl ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Fc1cccc(Br)c1, which has a property value of 0.21485805. The presence of the acetyl group (CC(=O)N-) in the target molecule introduces an additional polar functional group compared to the example with fluorine and bromine.

Considering the examples, molecules with halogen substituents on aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, while the presence of carbonyl and amide groups can introduce negative contributions due to their polar nature. The balance of these effects should be considered.

Given these considerations, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to be slightly positive, but less than the example with just halogens. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.1.

Looking at the examples, we can find similar structures:

1. CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethylbenzene) has a property value of 0.18629492.
2. CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (cumene) has a property value of 0.81425416.

The structure of isobutylbenzene is similar to cumene, as both have a branched alkyl group attached to a benzene ring. However, the branching in isobutylbenzene is slightly different, which might affect the property value.

Considering the similarity to cumene and the slight structural difference, the property value for isobutylbenzene (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1) is likely to be close to that of cumene but slightly lower due to the different branching. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is approximately 0.7.

- O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O (dinitrobenzene) has a property value of -0.50345007.

These examples suggest that benzene derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro or carbonyl groups) tend to have negative property values. The aldehyde group in benzaldehyde is an electron-withdrawing group, similar to the nitro and carbonyl groups in the examples.

Considering the influence of the aldehyde group and the aromatic ring, the property value for benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) is likely to be negative and within the range of the examples provided. Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of benzaldehyde is approximately -0.5.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.9104658395428563
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group and an oxazole ring. The presence of a nitro group (N(=O)=O) often contributes to a more negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature. Additionally, the oxazole ring and the carbonyl groups can also influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2, have a property value of 4.63343273, which is relatively high. However, this molecule also contains multiple aromatic rings and chlorine atoms, which can increase the property value.

On the other hand, simpler aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as Clc1ccccc1, have a property value close to zero (0.00079104).

Considering the structure of the given molecule, it is likely to have a property value that is negative due to the presence of the nitro group and the heterocyclic structure, but not as negative as some of the simpler structures with strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.5.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.8239558457211699
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, which is structurally similar to the example molecule N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 2.705569.

The key structural feature in both molecules is the presence of two phenyl rings connected by a nitrogen-nitrogen linkage. The example molecule has a double-bonded nitrogen (azo group), while the target molecule has a single-bonded nitrogen (hydrazine group). The presence of the single-bonded nitrogen in the target molecule might slightly reduce the property value compared to the azo compound due to differences in electronic properties and steric effects.

Considering these structural similarities and differences, the predicted property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be slightly lower than 2.705569. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around 2.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a relatively small and compact structure with two amide groups and a cyclohexane ring. In the examples, similar cyclic structures with amide groups, such as O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, have property values around -0.63099852.

Considering the structural similarity to other cyclic amides and diketopiperazines in the examples, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be in the same range as other small cyclic amides.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately -0.65.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, tend to have higher property values. This particular example has a property value of 18.70326807.
- Simpler chlorinated aromatic compounds, like Clc1ccccc1Cl, have a property value of 0.65274663.

The given molecule, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is more complex than Clc1ccccc1Cl but less complex than the highly chlorinated example with a value of 18.70326807. It is reasonable to predict that the property value will be higher than 0.65274663 but significantly lower than 18.70326807.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 2.5.

True Property: 0.4409993852779535
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:

1. Aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions tend to have property values around or slightly below zero, depending on the nature and number of substituents.
2. The presence of additional alkyl groups generally increases the property value, as seen in the examples with long alkyl chains or multiple alkyl substitutions.

Given these observations, the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is similar to the example Cc1ccccc1N (aniline), which has a property value of -0.46946932. However, the additional ethyl group in CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 should increase the property value slightly due to the increased hydrophobic character and molecular size.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be slightly higher than that of aniline, but still close to zero. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around:

To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a sulfonamide derivative, which is similar to some of the nitroaromatic compounds in the examples.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O consists of a benzene ring with a sulfonamide group attached. The presence of the sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is somewhat similar to the nitro groups (N(=O)=O) in terms of electron-withdrawing effects, which can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, nitroaromatic compounds such as Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O have a property value of -0.63386301, and Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.35019697. These values are negative, indicating that the presence of strong electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups tends to result in negative property values.

Given the structural similarity and the electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonamide group, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O will also be negative and likely in a similar range to the nitroaromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is approximately -0.5.

Based on the examples provided, the property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of aromatic rings and the degree of conjugation. The molecule you provided, c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a high degree of conjugation, similar to the example c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54, which has a property value of 9.90710417.

Given the structural similarity and the high degree of conjugation, I would predict that the property value for the molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 is also quite high. A reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 9.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the more complex aromatic structures in the examples, particularly those with multiple aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups.

From the examples, molecules with multiple aromatic rings and oxygen functionalities, such as OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5 (property value: 30.64625144) and Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 (property value: 1.509337), tend to have higher property values.

Given the structure of the target molecule, which includes multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone, it is likely to have a significant property value, but not as high as the most complex examples with additional halogen or nitro groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 would be around 1.5 to 2.0. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately:

True Property: -0.6108749444777524
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we need to consider the structural features and functional groups present in the molecule and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphoric acid ester group (P=O and P-OC)
- A thioester group (C-S-C=O)
- An amide linkage (NC(C)=O)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with phosphoric acid ester groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl and COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, have relatively high property values (4.06518157 and 9.61654305, respectively).
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCCCC2, tend to have negative property values (-0.60743427).
- Molecules with thioester groups are not directly represented in the examples, but sulfur-containing groups can contribute to higher property values.

Considering these observations, the presence of the phosphoric acid ester group suggests a potential for a higher property value, while the amide linkage might contribute to a lower value. The thioester group could also influence the property value positively.

Balancing these factors, I would predict a property value that is moderately positive, reflecting the influence of the phosphoric acid ester and thioester groups, while being moderated by the amide linkage.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is approximately 2.5.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.2790010723636846
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a simple alkene with two chlorine atoms attached to the carbon-carbon double bond. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, have very high property values, likely due to the high electronegativity and polarizability of chlorine atoms.

However, simpler molecules with fewer chlorine atoms, such as Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, have lower property values. Given that Cl\C=C/Cl is a small molecule with two chlorine atoms, we can expect its property value to be lower than those of larger, more complex chlorinated compounds.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around 0.5, reflecting the influence of the chlorine atoms while accounting for the simplicity of the molecule.

True Property: -0.6668406691058956
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and their properties. Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle similar to benzene but with a nitrogen atom replacing one of the carbon atoms in the ring. 

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as pyridine derivatives, tend to have property values around the range of -0.3 to 0.4. For instance, the molecule c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 has a property value of 0.41027161, and CNc1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.39473171.

Considering pyridine's structure and comparing it to similar aromatic compounds in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccncc1 would be around 0.1. This value reflects its aromatic nature and the presence of a nitrogen atom, which slightly affects the property compared to benzene. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for c1ccncc1 is approximately 0.1.

True Property: 0.8460213158632444
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has several key features:
1. An aromatic ring (phenyl group) attached to an amide linkage (C(=O)N).
2. A chlorinated aromatic ring, which is similar to some of the examples with chlorinated aromatic systems.
3. An ether linkage (O-C-O) and a hydroxyl group (OH), which are polar functional groups.

From the examples:
- Molecules with chlorinated aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1 (0.59335903) and Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (2.45959785), tend to have higher property values.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 (1.12205205), also have relatively high property values.
- The presence of polar groups like hydroxyls and ethers can lower the property value, as seen in molecules like OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO (-1.13569008).

Considering these factors, the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 has a combination of features that suggest a moderately high property value, influenced by the chlorinated aromatic ring and the amide linkage, but potentially moderated by the polar ether and hydroxyl groups.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.8.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.6367473804784176
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a terminal hydroxyl group, making it a primary alcohol (1-pentanol).

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Linear alkanes and simple alcohols tend to have property values around or slightly below zero.
- For instance, OC1CCCCCCC1 (a cyclic alcohol) has a property value of -0.17997581.
- CCCCC(=O)CCCC (a linear ketone) has a property value of 0.58297818.
- CCCCCCI (a linear alkane with iodine) has a property value of 1.21945678.

Considering the structure of CCCCCO, it is less complex than the cyclic alcohol and the ketone, and it lacks the heavy halogen atom present in CCCCCCI. Therefore, its property value is likely to be closer to zero, but slightly negative due to the presence of the hydroxyl group, which can introduce some polarity.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be around -0.1.

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: -0.587418970876078
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is known to increase the polarity of the molecule.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which also contributes to polarity and can affect the overall property.
- An aromatic ring (phenyl group), which can influence the property depending on its substitution pattern.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can also contribute to the polarity.

From the examples, molecules with polar functional groups such as sulfonyl, carbonyl, and ether tend to have negative property values, indicating a potential for lower hydrophobicity or higher solubility in polar solvents.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be around -0.5. This accounts for the presence of polar groups and the aromatic ring, which can slightly offset the polarity.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:

1. **Aromatic Ring**: The presence of a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) is a common feature in many of the examples, often contributing to a positive property value.

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The nitro group is known to have a significant impact on the property value, often leading to a negative contribution. For instance, in the example "Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O", the property value is -0.29797691.

3. **Ester Groups (C(=O)OC)**: The presence of ester groups can also influence the property value. In the example "CCCCCC(=O)OC", the property value is -0.56844383, indicating a potential negative contribution.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring with Nitrogen**: The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring (C1=C(C)NC) can also affect the property value, often contributing positively or negatively depending on the context.

5. **Substituents**: The presence of methyl groups (C) and other substituents can have varying effects, often contributing slightly positively.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule has both positive and negative contributing factors. The aromatic ring and methyl groups may contribute positively, while the nitro group and ester groups may contribute negatively.

Based on the balance of these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be slightly negative, around -0.3 to -0.5. Therefore, a specific predicted property value could be:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a bicyclic compound with two amide groups. It resembles a diketopiperazine structure, which is a cyclic dipeptide. The examples provided show that cyclic structures with heteroatoms (like nitrogen and oxygen) tend to have negative property values, especially when they contain carbonyl groups (C=O) and nitrogen atoms in a ring, as seen in examples like c1ccncc1 (-0.66684067) and Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12 (-0.93262749).

Considering the structural similarity to these examples, particularly the presence of carbonyl and nitrogen atoms in a cyclic structure, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for this molecule. The presence of two carbonyl groups and the bicyclic nature might slightly increase the value compared to simpler heterocycles, but it is still likely to be negative.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.5.

SMILES: ClCC
True Property: -0.608970288260927
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

ClCC is a small, simple molecule with a chloro group attached to a short carbon chain. In the examples, small and simple molecules like CCC (propane) and Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) have property values close to zero, with Clc1ccccc1 having a value of 0.00079104. Given the simplicity and small size of ClCC, it is reasonable to predict a property value close to zero.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCC is approximately 0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a pyridine ring and a trichloromethyl group.

From the examples, we can observe that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have higher property values. For instance, Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 5.33819044, and Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 7.69171574. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings seems to contribute to higher property values.

Given that Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a pyridine ring (which is similar to a benzene ring but with a nitrogen atom) and a trichloromethyl group, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be in a similar range to the other highly chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Therefore, I would predict the property value for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl to be approximately 6.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCC(C)O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples. The molecule CCCCC(C)O is a primary alcohol with a six-carbon chain, similar to CCCCCCCO (heptanol) but with one less carbon.

From the examples, we have:
- CCCCCCCCl (1-chloroheptane) with a property value of 0.92108034
- CCCCCC#C (1-heptyne) with a property value of -0.10492468
- CCCCCC(O)CCC (a secondary alcohol) with a property value of -0.2715914

The molecule CCCCC(C)O is a primary alcohol, which generally has a slightly negative property value, similar to other alcohols in the list. Given the trend that longer carbon chains tend to increase the property value slightly, and considering the presence of the hydroxyl group, we can estimate the property value to be slightly negative but closer to zero than the secondary alcohol example.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCC(C)O is approximately -0.2.

To predict the property value for the molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is 1,4-dibromobenzene, which is an aromatic compound with two bromine atoms attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have positive property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl has a property value of 4.5022484, and ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 has a property value of 12.32220122.

2. The presence of multiple halogen atoms, especially heavier halogens like bromine, can increase the property value compared to compounds with lighter halogens like chlorine.

3. Simple aromatic compounds with halogen substituents, such as Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene), tend to have lower positive values compared to more complex structures.

Considering these points, 1,4-dibromobenzene is expected to have a positive property value, likely higher than simple chlorinated benzenes but lower than more complex or heavily substituted aromatic compounds.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around 1.5 to 3.0. Given the examples and trends, a specific predicted property value could be approximately:

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated biphenyl, similar to the example Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 201.10451402. 

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl has a similar structure but with fewer chlorine atoms compared to the example. The example molecule has 10 chlorine atoms, while the molecule in question has 6 chlorine atoms. The presence of chlorine atoms significantly influences the property value, likely due to their electron-withdrawing nature and impact on molecular weight and other properties.

Given the structural similarity and the reduced number of chlorine atoms, we can expect the property value to be lower than 201.10451402 but still relatively high compared to molecules with fewer or no chlorine atoms. 

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately 120.0.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1

This molecule contains a phosphoric acid ester group (OP(=O)(O-)O-) attached to aromatic rings. The presence of aromatic rings and the phosphoric acid ester group can influence the property value.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl) tend to have higher property values. The presence of the phosphoric acid ester group, which is electron-withdrawing, might increase the property value compared to a simple aromatic hydrocarbon.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.5. This is based on the balance between the electron-withdrawing nature of the phosphoric acid ester group and the aromatic character of the molecule.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to be electron-withdrawing and can increase the lipophilicity of the molecule.
- An aromatic ring, which can contribute to stability and potential interactions.
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle, which can affect the electronic properties and solubility.
- Multiple chlorine atoms, which are also electron-withdrawing and can increase lipophilicity.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with multiple halogens, especially chlorine, tend to have higher property values (e.g., Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl with a value of 20.47795402 and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl with a value of 51.74268014).
- The presence of a trifluoromethyl group and multiple chlorines suggests a higher property value due to increased lipophilicity and potential for interactions.

Based on these observations, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O is likely to be significantly positive, reflecting the influence of the halogens and the aromatic system.

A reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 10.0, considering the structural similarities to other high-value examples.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.4570654437513658
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitrobenzene derivative with a methoxy group attached to the benzene ring. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to contribute negatively to the property value, as seen in O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-0.50345007).
- Methoxy groups (OCH3) also tend to contribute negatively, as seen in COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC (-0.60344306).

Considering these observations, the presence of both a nitro group and a methoxy group on the benzene ring suggests a negative contribution to the property value. The molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is structurally similar to the example O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, but with a methoxy group instead of a second nitro group, which should result in a less negative value than -0.50345007.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around -0.4.

True Property: 10.232742256287557
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated polycyclic compound. From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Highly chlorinated compounds tend to have positive property values. For instance, ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl has a property value of 1.66757544.
2. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, likely due to increased molecular weight and potential for interactions.

Given the structure of the molecule, which is heavily chlorinated and polycyclic, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. The complexity and high degree of chlorination suggest a property value higher than simpler chlorinated compounds.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl would be approximately 2.5.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.8113782324103203
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with ester groups (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 with a property value of -0.52861473) tend to have negative property values.
- Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCCCC with a property value of 2.26047346) tend to have positive property values, but the presence of functional groups like esters can shift this.

Given that CCCOC=O is a relatively simple ester with a short aliphatic chain, it is likely to have a property value that is negative, similar to other small esters in the examples.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be around -0.5.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 1.7574500239120163
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a long-chain ester, specifically a decanoate ester, which is similar to other aliphatic compounds in the examples.

Looking at the examples, we see that aliphatic compounds with longer carbon chains tend to have positive property values, such as CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 (2.00500114) and CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC (1.92135359). The presence of an ester group, as in CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C (2.58977429), also suggests a positive property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is likely to be positive and in the range of similar aliphatic esters. A reasonable prediction would be around 1.5.

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 2.115226309709136
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.0696175.
- Molecules with phenol groups, such as Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1, have a property value of 0.17530295.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, have a property value of -0.75650271.

Considering these features and their influence on the property value, the presence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro and chloro groups tends to lower the property value. The combination of these features suggests a property value that is likely negative and possibly close to the values of similar structures with nitro and chloro groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be approximately -0.5.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 9.828663066165765
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- Two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are similar to the phosphorothioate group in the example molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 3.36332856.
- Aromatic rings with substituents, similar to other aromatic compounds in the examples, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl with a property value of 7.69171574.

The presence of multiple phosphorothioate groups and aromatic rings suggests a relatively high property value, as seen in the examples with similar features. However, the absence of halogens, which tend to increase the property value significantly, suggests a more moderate value compared to the highest examples.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 would be around 3.5. This accounts for the influence of the phosphorothioate groups and the aromatic structure, while being moderated by the absence of halogens.

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.5878854107922389
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to the benzene ring.

In the examples, we have:
- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which is nitrotoluene, with a property value of -0.29797691.
- Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, which is chlorophenylamine, with a property value of -0.28676495.
- Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1, which is a more complex aromatic compound, with a property value of 15.71043464.

The presence of the nitro group generally increases the electron-withdrawing nature of the molecule, which can affect the property value. The phenol group (hydroxyl group) can also influence the property due to its electron-donating nature.

Considering the structural similarity to nitrotoluene and the influence of the nitro and hydroxyl groups, the property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is likely to be in a similar range to that of nitrotoluene, but slightly more negative due to the additional electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group compared to the methyl group in nitrotoluene.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be approximately -0.35.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. This molecule is a complex sugar, likely a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide, given its multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic acetal structures.

From the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic structures, such as sugars, tend to have negative property values. For instance, C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, a simpler sugar, has a property value of -1.11589743. The complexity and number of hydroxyl groups in the given molecule suggest it might have a similar or slightly more negative value due to increased hydrogen bonding and solubility effects.

Considering these factors, I would predict the property value for the given molecule to be approximately -1.2.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -0.6839298324426628
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the overall size of the molecule.

The molecule CCC#C is a small alkyne with a terminal triple bond. In the examples, small hydrocarbons with unsaturation, such as CCC(=O)C and CCC(C)C(=O)C, have negative property values. Additionally, the presence of a triple bond, as seen in N#Cc1ccccc1C#N, also corresponds to a negative property value.

Considering these observations, it is reasonable to predict that CCC#C will have a negative property value, likely in the range of other small unsaturated hydrocarbons. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C is approximately -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 3.36332856.
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine atoms, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 7.69171574, and Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, which has a property value of 6.7250677.

Considering the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the highly chlorinated aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be influenced by both the electron-withdrawing effects of the chlorine atoms and the presence of the phosphorothioate group.

Given these considerations, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be in the range of the higher values observed for chlorinated aromatic compounds with additional functional groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 contains a pyridine ring (c1nccc1) with a carbonyl group (C=O) and a hydrazine group (NN) attached. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2, which has a property value of -1.01817393. Both molecules contain nitrogen heterocycles and carbonyl groups, which can contribute to similar electronic properties.

Considering the structural similarities and the presence of electron-withdrawing groups, the property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is likely to be in the negative range, similar to the example mentioned.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be approximately -0.9.

True Property: 2.9685570237064076
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples. The molecule in question, CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, contains several functional groups and structural elements that can influence its property value.

1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S)(O)S)**: This group is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, which has a property value of 0.42785625. The presence of this group suggests a potential increase in the property value.

2. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: The amide group is present in several examples, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C with a property value of -0.88281757, indicating a potential decrease in the property value.

3. **Cyclohexane Ring (N1CCCCC1)**: This structural feature is present in several examples, such as C/C1CCCCC1\C with a property value of 0.46432939, suggesting a moderate influence on the property value.

4. **Alkyl Chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)**: These are common in many examples and generally contribute to a moderate property value.

Considering these structural features and their influence based on the examples, the predicted property value for CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is likely to be around 0.5. This value accounts for the balancing effects of the phosphorothioate group, the amide group, and the cyclohexane ring, along with the alkyl chains.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 1.1791738941695231
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (octane), we can analyze the trends in the provided examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of functional groups, aromatic rings, and the overall size of the molecule.

In the examples, simple aliphatic alcohols and ethers tend to have negative property values, while larger, more complex aromatic compounds with multiple rings or halogen substitutions tend to have higher positive values. For straight-chain alkanes, the property values are generally low and negative, as seen with molecules like CCCCCC (hexane) which has a property value of -0.27062295.

Given that CCCCCCCC is a straight-chain alkane with no functional groups or aromatic rings, it is reasonable to predict a property value similar to other simple alkanes. Since octane is slightly larger than hexane, its property value might be slightly less negative due to increased molecular size.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (octane) would be around -0.2.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 0.23298226440701186
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as the presence of functional groups, the degree of saturation, aromaticity, and steric effects. The given examples suggest that the property values are influenced by these structural features.

The molecule in question, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, contains several notable features:
- It has a cyclohexane framework with multiple fused rings, similar to some of the examples provided.
- There is a ketone group (C=O) and an alcohol group (O), which can influence the property value.
- The presence of a triple bond (C#C) adds to the unsaturation and may affect the property value.
- The overall structure is quite complex, with multiple rings and functional groups.

Comparing this structure to the examples, particularly those with similar complexity and functional groups, we can make an educated guess. For instance, the molecule CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O has a property value of 2.15961392, and it shares some structural similarities with the molecule in question, such as the presence of a ketone and multiple rings.

Taking these factors into account, I would predict that the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is approximately 2.0.

True Property: -0.5728475037382365
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like the one you've provided requires analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples given. The molecule in question, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, appears to be a polycyclic compound with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups.

From the examples provided, it seems that larger, more complex polycyclic structures with multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21 has a property value of 8.95451661, and the molecule Cc1c(C)c2c3ccccc3ccc2c4ccccc14 has a property value of 10.87546051.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple aromatic and heteroatom-containing rings in the molecule you provided, it is reasonable to predict a relatively high property value. However, without specific information on the nature of the property being measured, this prediction is based on structural complexity and comparison to similar examples.

Therefore, I would predict a property value in the range of 8 to 12. A specific prediction could be around 10.5, considering the structural complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups.

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.21020874840114476
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to phenol (Oc1ccccc1) with an additional chlorine atom. In the examples, we have:

- Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (a nitrophenol) with a property value of -0.58788541.
- Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) with a property value of -0.34228771.
- Clc1ccccc1I (iodobenzene) with a property value of 0.59335903.

The presence of a chlorine atom generally increases the property value compared to hydrogen, as seen in the examples with halogenated benzenes. However, the presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) in phenol tends to decrease the property value, as seen in the nitrophenol example.

Considering these factors, the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is likely to be slightly higher than that of phenol with a nitro group but lower than that of iodobenzene. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around -0.3.

- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C)
- An ester linkage (OC(=O))
- An amide linkage (NC(=O))
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, especially on aromatic rings, tend to have higher property values (e.g., Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl with 51.74268014).
- Molecules with ester and amide linkages tend to have negative property values (e.g., CCC(C)C1(CC(Br)=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O with -0.41765456).
- The presence of a chloroalkyne group is not directly represented in the examples, but the presence of chlorine generally increases the property value.

Considering these factors, the presence of chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring and the overall structure, the property value is likely to be positive but not extremely high due to the balancing effect of the ester and amide groups.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around 1.5.

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 2.6157473545451215
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- Two chlorophenyl groups, which are known to increase the property value due to the presence of chlorine atoms.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2), which is a heterocyclic aromatic ring and may contribute to a lower property value.
- An alcohol group (OC), which can also lower the property value due to its polar nature.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl and Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc2Cl, have very high property values (18.70326807 and 32.67306934, respectively).
- Molecules with aromatic rings and chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1, have moderate property values (0.79291214 and 0.65274663, respectively).
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings and polar groups, such as Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2 and C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, have lower property values (-0.90159903 and -1.11589743, respectively).

Considering these observations, the presence of two chlorophenyl groups suggests a higher property value, but the pyrimidine ring and alcohol group may moderate this effect. Therefore, the predicted property value for OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl is likely to be positive but not extremely high.

A reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately 1.5.

- CCCCCC(=O)OCC has a property value of -0.56844383.

The molecule CCCCCOC=O is structurally similar to CCCCCCC=O and CCCCCC(=O)OCC, both of which have negative property values. The presence of the ester group (OC=O) in CCCCCOC=O is similar to CCCCCC(=O)OCC, which has a property value of -0.56844383.

Considering these similarities, the predicted property value for CCCCCOC=O is likely to be negative and close to the value of CCCCCC(=O)OCC. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O is approximately -0.55.

To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methylphenol, specifically p-cresol, which consists of a benzene ring with a methyl group and a hydroxyl group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with phenolic groups (like Oc1cccc(O)c1) tend to have negative property values, such as -0.66139132.
- Molecules with alkyl groups attached to aromatic rings (like CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O) have a positive property value, such as 0.45484656.

Considering the structure of Cc1cccc(C)c1O, it is similar to the example CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, but with one less methyl group. The presence of the hydroxyl group suggests a potential for a slightly negative or neutral property value, but the overall structure is more similar to the example with a positive value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is likely to be slightly positive, around 0.1 to 0.2. Given the examples and the structural similarities, a reasonable prediction would be:

The examples show that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have high property values. For instance:
- "Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl" has a property value of 20.47795402.
- "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl" has a property value of 32.67306934.
- "Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl" has a property value of 2.45959785.

The given molecule "Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl" is less chlorinated than the second example but more than the third. It is similar to the first example in terms of the number of chlorine atoms and the biphenyl structure.

Considering these comparisons, the predicted property value for "Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl" would likely be between the values of the first and third examples, but closer to the first due to the similar structure and degree of chlorination.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately 20.0.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.25633754238105394
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple hydrocarbon with a branched structure and a double bond. It is similar to other hydrocarbons in the list, such as CCCCCCCC (1.17917389) and CCCCCCCC=C (2.26047346), which are linear or slightly branched alkanes and alkenes.

Given that isoprene is a smaller molecule with a branched structure and a double bond, it is likely to have a property value that is somewhat lower than the larger linear alkenes but higher than the smaller alkanes. Considering the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around 1.0. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC=C(C)C is approximately 1.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule ClCCl is a simple dichloromethane, which is a small, non-aromatic, and non-polar molecule. 

From the examples, we can observe that small, non-aromatic, and non-polar molecules tend to have lower property values. For instance, the molecule ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl, which is a chlorinated compound, has a property value of 0.74771271. However, ClCCl is even simpler and smaller than this example.

Considering the simplicity and size of ClCCl, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is lower than the more complex chlorinated compounds. Therefore, a predicted property value for ClCCl would be around 0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. The molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

In the examples, we have a similar molecule, Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which is 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, with a property value of 1.15628179. Given the structural similarity and the presence of the same functional groups (hydroxyl and multiple chloro groups on a benzene ring), it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl will be very close to this value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is approximately 1.15628179.

True Property: -0.5728475037382365
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like the one you've provided involves considering various structural features and their contributions to the property in question. The examples you've given suggest that the property might be related to some form of molecular descriptor or calculated property, such as a logP value, polar surface area, or a quantum chemical descriptor.

The molecule you've provided, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, is quite complex, featuring multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and a significant degree of oxygenation, which suggests a high degree of polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, which generally contribute to lower property values in the examples provided, I would predict a property value that is negative and possibly lower than many of the simpler structures with fewer polar groups.

Based on the patterns observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule might be around -0.8. However, this is a rough estimate and should be verified with appropriate computational methods or experimental data.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.8549892718894334
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A thiomethyl group (CS-)
- A pyrazole ring (1,2,4-triazole-like structure)
- A carbonyl group (=O)
- An amine group (N)
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of halogens, especially multiple chlorines, tends to increase the property value significantly.
- Molecules with bulky alkyl groups like tert-butyl can have slightly positive or negative values depending on other functional groups.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C has a combination of a heterocyclic ring with a carbonyl and an amine, similar to some of the examples with negative values. The tert-butyl group might slightly increase the value, but the overall structure suggests a negative property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be around -0.7.

True Property: -0.3210887912242995
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate, which is an ester formed from benzoic acid and ethanol. In the examples, we have several molecules with aromatic rings and ester functionalities:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 has a property value of -0.6357877.
2. CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of -0.2317615.
3. CCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of -0.38877255.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is structurally similar to these examples, particularly the second one, which also contains an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group. The presence of the ester group in CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 suggests that its property value might be slightly negative, similar to the examples with ester functionalities.

Considering these comparisons, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around -0.3. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

-0.3

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 1.155174716791866
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached, making it a bromoalkane. In the examples, we have a similar structure, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which is a brominated aromatic compound with a property value of 1.58740927. However, CCCCCCCBr is a simpler, non-aromatic structure.

Looking at other linear alkyl chains in the examples, such as CCCCCCCCO with a property value of -0.27062295, we can infer that the addition of a bromine atom might increase the property value slightly due to the increased molecular weight and potential for different interactions.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be slightly higher than that of a similar alkane without bromine. Therefore, I would predict a property value around 0.5 for CCCCCCCBr.
