SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.44162598398903397
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the trends and patterns from the given examples. The molecule in question is a linear ester with a long alkyl chain, similar to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Linear alkanes and their derivatives tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of an ester group (as in CCCCCCCC(=O)OC) also tends to result in negative property values.
- Longer alkyl chains in esters seem to have slightly less negative values compared to shorter ones.

Given these observations, the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which is a decyl ester, is expected to have a property value similar to other long-chain esters. For instance, CCCCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of -0.43214753, and CCCCCCCC(C)O has a value of -0.73827222.

Considering the length of the alkyl chain and the presence of the ester group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be slightly less negative than CCCCCCCC(=O)OC due to the longer chain, but still negative. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.4.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.5185731158002428
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure, specifically a chlorinated benzoxazole. The presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in examples like ClCCBr (2.59522039) and ClCC (6.35374385). However, the presence of an aromatic heterocycle and carbonyl group can have a different effect, as seen in examples like Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (3.88838796) and Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 (0.45215791).

Considering the balance between the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine and the electron-donating effect of the aromatic and heterocyclic structure, the property value is likely to be positive but not as high as the aliphatic chlorinated compounds.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around 0.5.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.9578089227849126
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite, which contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have negative property values. The presence of the nitro group, which is electron-withdrawing, typically contributes to a negative property value.

Considering the examples and the structural features of CC(C)N(=O)=O, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.6. This is based on the influence of the nitro group and the comparison with similar structures in the examples. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO

This molecule is a polycyclic compound with multiple rings and carbonyl groups, similar to some of the examples provided. Notably, it resembles the structure of steroids, which are often complex polycyclic compounds.

Let's compare it to the example:

CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C, 5.88426407

This example is a polycyclic compound with multiple rings and carbonyl groups, similar to the molecule we are analyzing. The property value for this example is relatively high, at 5.88426407.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of multiple rings and carbonyl groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for the given molecule will also be relatively high, though possibly slightly lower due to the presence of an additional hydroxyl group, which might slightly reduce the property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

This molecule contains:
- A fluorinated benzene ring (similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.39945465).
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N) connecting to another aromatic ring.
- A chlorinated benzene ring (similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 0.0).

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like fluorine and chlorine generally tends to lower the property value, as seen in the examples. The amide linkage is a common feature in several molecules with negative property values.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, the predicted property value for Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 is likely to be negative and somewhat similar to the values of molecules with similar functional groups.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately -0.5.

True Property: -0.741573374943511
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with a linear chain and a branching methyl group. 

Looking at the examples, we can find similar structures:
- CCCCCO (0.12764727): A linear chain with an ether group.
- CCCCCC1CCCC1 (3.18857839): A longer chain with a cyclic structure.
- CCC(C)CO (-0.68235705): A similar structure with a branching methyl group and an alcohol group.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is most similar to CCC(C)CO, but without the alcohol group. The presence of the ether group and the branching methyl group suggests that the property value might be slightly different from CCC(C)CO. Given the examples, the property value for CCCOC(C)C is likely to be closer to neutral or slightly positive.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C is approximately 0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. Let's analyze the examples:

1. Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br) tend to have negative property values, as seen in examples like Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (-0.68785982) and Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (-0.17974352).

2. Molecules with carbonyl groups (C=O) also tend to have negative property values, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.75236754) and CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (-0.74813753).

3. The presence of a pyrrole ring, as seen in Nc1nccs1 (-0.11426353), also suggests a tendency towards negative values.

Considering these factors, the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of halogen and carbonyl groups, as well as the pyrrole ring.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.7. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

True Property: -0.33111282573097417
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

Biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples, simple aromatic hydrocarbons and hydrocarbons with minimal functionalization tend to have property values around or slightly below zero. For instance, the molecule C1CCc2ccccc2C1 (a bicyclic aromatic compound) has a property value of -0.18385802, and Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C (a methylated biphenyl) has a property value of -0.67195749.

Given that biphenyl is a straightforward aromatic compound without additional functional groups, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be close to zero, possibly slightly negative due to its simplicity and lack of polar functional groups.

Therefore, the predicted property value for c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 (biphenyl) is approximately -0.2.

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.9414606609024078
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of molecular structures, and their property values seem to be influenced by factors such as the presence of functional groups, ring structures, and overall molecular size and shape.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear chain with a sulfur atom at the end. It is similar to the linear alkanes in the examples, such as CCCCCCC=C, which has a property value of -0.73267169, and CCCCCCC(C)O, which has a property value of -0.73827222. These examples suggest that linear alkanes with slight modifications (like a double bond or an alcohol group) tend to have property values around -0.7 to -0.8.

Given that CCCCCS is a simple linear chain with a sulfur atom, which is slightly more polarizable than a carbon or hydrogen atom, we can expect its property value to be in a similar range, but possibly slightly less negative due to the presence of sulfur.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be approximately -0.7.

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1.7791371855385318
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with a tertiary carbon attached to an alcohol group. This structure is similar to the example CCC(C)(C)C, which has a property value of 0.43509232. The presence of the alcohol group (OH) in CCCC(C)(C)CO could influence the property value, as seen in the example CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O, which has a property value of -0.26516328.

Considering the structural similarity and the influence of the alcohol group, the property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is likely to be slightly lower than that of CCC(C)(C)C due to the presence of the alcohol group, which tends to decrease the property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO would be around 0.1.

To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a naphthalene derivative, specifically 1-methylnaphthalene.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a property value of -0.56611382.
- Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (another naphthalene derivative) has a property value of -0.45413381.
- Cc1ccc(C)cc1 (a simple methyl-substituted benzene) has a property value of -0.17974352.

The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is similar to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, which is also a naphthalene derivative. Given the structural similarity, we can expect the property value to be close to that of Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately -0.45413381.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic urea, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -0.44575662. The main difference between the two molecules is the substitution of a methyl group (C) with a more complex alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the new molecule.

The addition of a larger alkyl group generally increases hydrophobicity, which might slightly increase the property value compared to the simpler structure. However, the overall structure and functional groups remain similar, suggesting that the property value will not deviate significantly from the example.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be slightly higher than -0.44575662, but still negative due to the presence of polar urea groups. A predicted value could be around -0.4.

True Property: -0.3994546483700708
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have negative property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of -0.17974352, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -0.75321958. These examples suggest that the presence of halogens, particularly in aromatic systems, generally leads to negative property values.

Given that trifluoromethyl is a strong electron-withdrawing group and considering the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 will also have a negative property value. However, the exact value is difficult to pinpoint without a more detailed analysis or computational tools.

Based on the trends and the nature of the substituents, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around -0.2 to -0.3. Therefore, a specific predicted value could be:

From the examples, we see that the molecule OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, which is a linear polyol similar to a sugar, has a property value of 8.78202813. The molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a cyclic form of a similar structure, which is typical for sugars like glucose.

Given the structural similarity and the high property value of the linear polyol, it is reasonable to predict that the cyclic sugar will also have a high property value. Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately 8.78202813.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. It resembles some of the more complex cyclic structures in the examples, such as CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of 6.91399228, and CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C, which has a property value of 5.54588227.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of multiple rings and ketone groups, the property value for the molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C is likely to be in a similar range. Considering the additional ester group, which might slightly increase the property value due to its polar nature, a reasonable prediction would be slightly higher than the example with the highest value.

It resembles some of the more complex structures in the examples, such as CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 5.37030618. This suggests that the presence of multiple rings and a ketone group contributes to a higher property value.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of the ketone group, the predicted property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O is likely to be in a similar range to the example with a similar structure.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule is approximately 5.37.

For instance, the molecule O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.35317254, and COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.19633512. Both of these molecules contain a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring, similar to the target molecule.

Considering the influence of the nitro group, which tends to increase the property value, and the acetamide group, which might have a neutral or slightly negative effect, the property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is likely to be in a similar range to the examples with nitro groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O would be around -0.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)SC)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring
- A heterocyclic structure with a nitrogen and oxygen atom

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with halogenated aromatic rings, such as Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2, tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with heterocyclic structures, such as COc2ncc1nccnc1n2, also tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of sulfur, as in CSSC, can lead to a positive property value, but this is in a different context (disulfide bond).

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of the chlorinated aromatic ring and the heterocyclic structure. The phosphorothioate group might slightly increase the value, but not enough to make it positive.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be around -0.5.

Looking at the examples, we can see that alcohols generally have negative property values. For instance, CCCCCC(C)O has a property value of -0.75004452, and CCC(C)CO has a property value of -0.5524486. These examples suggest that alcohols with similar structures tend to have negative property values.

Given that tert-butanol is a small, branched alcohol, we can expect its property value to be in the same range as the other alcohols. Considering the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO would be around -0.55.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)(C)CO is approximately -0.55.

The molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is similar to the purine-like structure COc2ncc1nccnc1n2, which has a negative property value. However, it also shares some structural features with Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F and Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1, which have positive property values.

Considering these comparisons, the molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is likely to have a property value that is slightly positive, but not as high as the more complex nitrogen-containing structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.5.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.7035458645550379
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, an ester. Esters in the examples tend to have negative property values, likely due to their polar nature and the presence of electronegative oxygen atoms. For instance, the molecule CCCOC(C)C, which is an ether, has a property value of -0.74157337, and the molecule CCOC=C, an ether with a double bond, has a property value of -0.1364729. 

Given that CC(C)OC=O is an ester, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Considering the examples, a value slightly more negative than -0.1364729 but less negative than -0.74157337 seems appropriate, as esters are generally more polar than ethers but less so than some other functional groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be approximately -0.5.

The given molecule is a urea derivative with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. This structure is similar to other aromatic compounds with amide or urea linkages in the examples, which generally have negative property values. For instance, the molecule CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1 has a property value of -0.68756639, and NC(=O)c1cccnc1 has a property value of -0.35317254.

Considering the presence of two phenyl rings and the urea linkage, which is similar to an amide group, the property value is likely to be negative. The presence of aromatic rings and the urea linkage suggests a property value in the range of other aromatic amides or urea derivatives.

Based on these observations, I predict the property value for O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 to be approximately -0.4.

To predict the property value for the molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The given molecule is triphenylene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a planar structure composed of four fused benzene rings.

In the examples, aromatic compounds with multiple benzene rings, such as biphenyl (N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2) and phenanthrene (c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1), have property values of 1.14647044 and 0.90056492, respectively. These values suggest that the property in question might be related to aromaticity or molecular size.

Triphenylene, being larger and more aromatic than biphenyl and phenanthrene, might have a slightly higher property value. Considering the trend in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of triphenylene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13) would be around 1.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 contains:
- A sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N), which is a common feature in many pharmaceuticals and can influence solubility and reactivity.
- An aromatic ring (phenyl group) with an amine substituent, which can affect electronic properties and polarity.
- A guanidine group (NC(=N)N), which is highly polar and can significantly impact the molecule's overall polarity and hydrogen bonding capability.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with high polarity or multiple polar functional groups, such as CNN (6.35374385) and ClC(=C(Cl)C(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl) (22.83585881), tend to have higher property values.
- Molecules with aromatic rings and polar substituents, like Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O (0.45194586), have moderate property values.

Given the presence of both the sulfonamide and guanidine groups, which are highly polar, and the aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be moderate to high. However, it is not expected to be as high as the most polar examples due to the lack of extensive halogenation or multiple highly electronegative atoms.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 would be around 0.5 to 1.0. A specific prediction could be 0.75, considering the balance of polar and aromatic features.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 5.447090583974068
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O

This molecule contains several notable features:

1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O):** The presence of nitro groups is known to influence the electronic properties of a molecule, often making it more electron-withdrawing and potentially affecting the overall property value. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative property values.

2. **Trifluoromethyl Group (C(F)(F)F):** The trifluoromethyl group is highly electronegative and can also contribute to electron-withdrawing effects, similar to nitro groups.

3. **Aromatic Ring:** The presence of an aromatic ring can contribute to the stability and electronic distribution within the molecule.

4. **Alkyl Chain with a Double Bond (CC(C)=C):** This feature can introduce some degree of unsaturation and influence the overall molecular geometry.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, particularly those with similar electron-withdrawing groups and aromatic systems, we can infer that the property value is likely to be negative. The presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups (two nitro groups and a trifluoromethyl group) suggests a significant electron-withdrawing effect, which is consistent with the examples that have negative property values.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around -0.7, considering the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents and the examples provided.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.7035458645550379
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples. The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate.

From the examples, we have:
- CC(C)CCOC=O, with a property value of -0.70370103
- CCC(C)(C)O, with a property value of 0.43509232

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is structurally similar to CC(C)CCOC=O, but with a shorter carbon chain. The presence of the ester functional group (OC=O) is a key feature, and the isopropyl group (CC(C)) is also present in both molecules.

Given the similarity to CC(C)CCOC=O, which has a property value of -0.70370103, and considering the shorter chain might slightly affect the value, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O would likely be close to this value, but possibly slightly less negative due to the reduced hydrophobic character from the shorter chain.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O is approximately -0.70.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 0.42010111415071183
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is structurally similar to c1ccccc1O (phenol), which has a property value of -0.21974714. The presence of additional methyl groups in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 could slightly alter the property value, but given the examples, the effect of methyl groups on aromatic rings tends to be relatively small.

Considering the examples and the structural similarity to phenol, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be slightly different from that of phenol, but not drastically so. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.2.

Predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1: -0.2

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has a thiophosphate group (P(=S)(OC)O) and a substituted aromatic ring with a methyl (C) and a thiomethyl (SC) group. We can compare this structure to similar molecules in the examples:

1. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl: -0.05784676
2. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl: -0.05784676
3. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl: -0.05784676

These examples have a thiophosphate group and a substituted aromatic ring with halogens. The property value for these molecules is consistently -0.05784676.

The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has a similar thiophosphate group and an aromatic ring, but instead of halogens, it has a thiomethyl and a methyl group. The presence of these groups might slightly alter the property value, but given the consistency in the examples with similar structures, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be close to those examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is approximately -0.05784676.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples provided. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -0.74771043, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -0.63144981. These examples suggest that heavily chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have negative property values.

Given the structure of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, which is a chlorinated biphenyl, it is reasonable to predict a similar negative property value. Considering the pattern observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.7. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

-0.7

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6830894145040554
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a nitroalkane, specifically a nitropropane.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to increase the property value, as seen in molecules like O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (1.8893) and CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O (4.95322412).

2. Simple alkanes like CCC (6.35374385) and CC (17.0074039) have high property values, but the presence of functional groups like nitro can significantly alter these values.

3. The presence of a nitro group in a relatively small alkane chain (like CCC) is likely to reduce the property value compared to the parent alkane without the nitro group.

Considering these points, the presence of the nitro group in CCCN(=O)=O will likely decrease the property value compared to CCC, but it will still be positive due to the alkane chain. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 1.5.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, which is similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's consider the examples with similar structures:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1: -0.17974352
- c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12: -0.68611365

Both examples involve aromatic rings with halogen substituents. The first example, Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, is particularly similar because it also has a halogen (chlorine) and a bromine on a benzene ring, and it has a property value of -0.17974352.

Given the similarity in structure, particularly the presence of a halogen and a bromine on an aromatic ring, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 will be close to that of Clc1ccc(Br)cc1. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is approximately -0.18.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.11531133612274665
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with tertiary alcohol groups, such as CCC(C)(C)O (0.36159397) and CC(C)(C)CO (0.43509232), tend to have positive property values.
2. Bicyclic structures, such as CC1CCCO1 (0.98314095), also tend to have positive property values.

Given that the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 has both a bicyclic structure and a tertiary alcohol group, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. Considering the examples, a value slightly higher than those of simple tertiary alcohols and possibly closer to the bicyclic example is plausible.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 would be approximately 0.9.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)
- An amide linkage (N2C(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)

Comparing this structure to the examples:
- The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O has a similar phosphorothioate group and an amide linkage, with a property value of 0.48097791.
- The presence of a phenyl ring is common in many examples, often contributing to a range of property values depending on additional functional groups.

Given the structural similarity to the example with a property value of 0.48097791, and considering the absence of additional groups that might significantly alter the property, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be close to this value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule is approximately 0.48.

True Property: -0.7462032461579974
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of -0.23372032. Both molecules contain aromatic rings and nitrogen heterocycles, but the example molecule has an additional aromatic ring and a more complex structure.

Given the structural similarities and the presence of electron-withdrawing groups (carbonyl and nitrogen heterocycle), it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C will be in the negative range, similar to the example molecule.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is approximately -0.25.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.1035530205797704
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which is a linear chain with a total of 9 carbon atoms.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCC, a linear alkane with 5 carbons, has a property value of 0.94146066.
- CCCCCS, a linear chain with 5 carbons and a sulfur atom, also has a property value of 0.94146066.
- CCCCCCC(=O)OC, a linear ester with 8 carbons, has a property value of -0.43981837.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar to CCCCCCC(=O)OC, but with one additional carbon in the ester group, making it a 9-carbon ester. Given the trend that adding more carbons to a linear chain tends to decrease the property value slightly, we can predict that the property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC will be slightly lower than -0.43981837.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be approximately -0.5.

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.652621767484337
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is methyl benzoate, an ester formed from benzoic acid and methanol.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 with a property value of -0.74773216
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 with a property value of -0.74813753

Both of these examples are esters with similar structures to methyl benzoate. The first example has an additional hydroxyl group on the benzene ring, while the second example is ethyl benzoate, which is very similar to methyl benzoate but with an ethyl group instead of a methyl group.

Given the close structural similarity between methyl benzoate and ethyl benzoate, we can expect the property value for methyl benzoate to be very close to that of ethyl benzoate. Therefore, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate) is approximately -0.748.

True Property: -0.7244224317356949
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the overall molecular structure.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, also known as 1,3-butadiene. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons and those with double bonds tend to have negative property values. For instance, CC/C=C/C (a linear hydrocarbon with a double bond) has a property value of -0.69313392, and CCC(=O)C (a ketone with a double bond) has a property value of -0.66061148.

Given this trend, it is reasonable to predict that C=CCC=C will also have a negative property value, likely in a similar range to these examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C is approximately -0.65.

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.19932215019186458
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is a simple compound with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. This structure is similar to other halogenated compounds in the examples, such as FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br, which has a property value of 3.25423964. However, BrC(Br)Br is less complex and has fewer different types of atoms compared to FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br.

Considering the simplicity and the high electronegativity of bromine, which can contribute to a higher property value, we can predict that BrC(Br)Br will have a positive property value, but likely lower than that of FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br due to its simpler structure.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around 2.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -0.66835668.
- A thioester linkage (SC(CCl)), which is not directly present in the examples but can be considered similar to other sulfur-containing groups.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is present in several examples with varying effects on the property value.
- An amide linkage (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O), similar to the example CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.6475503.

Considering these features and the property values of similar structures, the molecule is likely to have a property value in the negative range, influenced by the presence of the phosphorothioate and amide groups.

Based on the analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be approximately -0.65.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule contains a combination of functional groups and structural motifs that can influence its property value.

1. **Amide Group (CN(C)C(=O)N):** This functional group is present in several examples, such as CN(C)C(=O)C (0.95780892) and CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C (4.4044163). The presence of the amide group can contribute positively to the property value.

2. **Chlorine Substituent (c(Cl)c1):** Chlorine atoms are present in several examples, such as ClCCCCl (0.94146066) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (1.54183841). Chlorine substituents can have varying effects, but they often contribute positively to the property value.

3. **Aromatic Ring with Nitrogen and Oxygen (n2nc(oc2=O)):** This heterocyclic structure can influence the property value. The presence of nitrogen and oxygen in a ring can contribute to a more complex electronic environment, potentially affecting the property value.

4. **Tert-butyl Group (C(C)(C)C):** This bulky group can influence the property value by affecting the molecule's steric and electronic properties. It is present in some examples with higher property values.

Considering these structural features and their potential influence on the property value, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be positive and relatively high, similar to other molecules with complex structures and multiple functional groups.

Based on the analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C is approximately **3.5**.

True Property: 0.25528805062411636
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with chlorine atoms attached to each ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a property value of 0.45215791. However, the molecule in question has an additional ether linkage and an extra chlorine atom, which could influence the property value.

Considering the examples, molecules with more halogen atoms, especially chlorine, tend to have higher property values due to increased electron-withdrawing effects and potential for higher molecular weight. The presence of the ether linkage might also contribute to a slightly higher property value compared to a simple dichlorobenzene.

Taking these factors into account, I would predict the property value for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl to be slightly higher than 0.45215791, but not excessively so, as the structure is still relatively similar to the dichlorobenzene example.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately 0.55.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC/C=C\C, we can look at the example provided for a similar molecule, CC/C=C/C, which has a property value of -0.69313392. The only difference between the two molecules is the stereochemistry around the double bond, which is unlikely to significantly affect the property value in this context. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C would be approximately -0.69313392.

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 0.12764726816800584
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCOCC is a simple linear ether, similar to other small organic molecules in the list.

Looking at the examples, small aliphatic molecules with simple functional groups (like alcohols, ethers, and alkanes) tend to have property values around the range of -0.7 to 0.2. For instance:
- CC(C)O has a property value of 0.19932215.
- CC(C)Cl has a property value of 0.19932215.
- CCC(O)CC has a property value of -0.74756739.

Given that CCCOCC is an ether, it is likely to have a property value closer to the lower end of this range, similar to other small ethers or alcohols. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be around -0.7.

Thus, the predicted property value for CCCOCC is approximately -0.7.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a tertiary amide with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. This structure is similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 6.09485659. Both molecules have a central amide group and two phenyl rings, although the example molecule has an additional heterocyclic ring.

Another similar example is CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23, which has a property value of 6.04924114. This molecule also contains an amide group and a complex ring structure, although it lacks the phenyl groups.

Considering the structural similarities, particularly the presence of the amide group and phenyl rings, the property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be in a similar range to these examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 6.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-), which is a common feature in several molecules.
- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1), which is similar to the structure in Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 with a property value of -0.17974352.

The presence of the acetamide group might slightly alter the property value compared to the simple bromobenzene structure. However, the overall influence of the bromine and aromatic ring is likely to dominate the property value.

Considering the examples and the structural similarities, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be close to -0.17974352, but slightly more negative due to the additional acetamide group. Therefore, a predicted property value could be approximately -0.200.

True Property: -0.6435393776544228
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is isopropylbenzene, also known as cumene. It consists of an isopropyl group (CC(C)) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1).

Looking at the examples, we have:

- Cc1ccccc1N (aniline), with a property value of 0.26249479
- Cc1ccnc(C)c1 (a methylpyridine), with a property value of 0.0
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethylbenzene), with a property value of -0.60267334
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (p-cymene), with a property value of -0.5785916

The structure of cumene is similar to ethylbenzene and p-cymene, both of which have negative property values. Given that cumene is a simple alkylbenzene like ethylbenzene and p-cymene, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and in a similar range.

Therefore, based on the structural similarity and the property values of related compounds, I would predict the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 to be approximately -0.60.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 2.45925778, and O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of 1.01908422. On the other hand, simpler aromatic compounds without strong electron-withdrawing groups, such as COc1ccccc1, have lower property values (-0.6820098).

Benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, but not as strong as nitro groups. Therefore, we can expect the property value to be positive but not as high as those with multiple nitro groups.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 would be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring, similar to some of the examples. The presence of the nitro group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, often contributes to a negative property value in the examples provided. Additionally, the molecule contains a lactam ring, which is a cyclic amide, and this feature is also present in some of the examples with negative property values.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for this molecule will be negative. Based on the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value could be around -0.5, as this is a common range for molecules with similar electron-withdrawing groups and aromatic systems.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is approximately -0.5.

True Property: 2.751610692049669
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple aromatic rings, especially those with conjugated systems, tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 has a property value of 1.14647044, which is relatively high due to the presence of two phenyl rings connected by a diazo group.

The molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is similar in structure, with two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group. The presence of the hydrazine group, which is less electron-withdrawing than the diazo group, might slightly lower the property value compared to the diazo compound.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would likely be slightly lower than 1.14647044 but still positive due to the presence of the two phenyl rings. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around 0.9.

   - Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -0.55675892.

2. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms often results in a more negative property value. For example:
   - Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 4.75724969, but this is an outlier due to the presence of multiple nitro groups.
   - ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O has a property value of 1.13903167, which is positive due to the presence of a sulfur atom and a bicyclic structure.

3. The presence of a pyridine ring (a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring) can influence the property value. For example:

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar features (such as aromatic rings, halogens, and nitrogen-containing groups) tend to have property values around the range of -0.6 to -0.2. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group and multiple chlorine atoms suggests a more negative property value due to increased electron-withdrawing effects.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O would be around -0.3.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.19633511819976213
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring, and a nitro group (NO2) also attached to the benzene ring. 

From the examples, we can observe the following:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, tend to have negative property values. The example given has a property value of -0.27308355.
- Molecules with methoxy groups, such as COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC, have a property value of 0.35823779, which is positive.
- The presence of a benzene ring can contribute to a range of property values, depending on the substituents.

Considering the combination of a methoxy group and a nitro group on a benzene ring, the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group might dominate, leading to a more negative property value. However, the methoxy group could slightly offset this effect.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be slightly negative, but not as negative as some of the other nitro-containing compounds without methoxy groups.

Therefore, a predicted property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O could be approximately -0.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of -0.74506948. Both molecules are heavily chlorinated, which typically increases the electron-withdrawing nature and can affect the overall molecular polarity and other properties.

Given the structural similarity and the high degree of chlorination, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl will be in a similar range to the example provided.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is approximately -0.745.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.4246396676219641
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with halogens or nitro groups tend to have negative property values.
- Simple hydrocarbons and ethers tend to have property values closer to zero or slightly positive.
- Larger, more complex molecules with multiple functional groups or rings tend to have higher property values.

The molecule CCCOC=O is relatively simple, with an ester functional group and a three-carbon chain. It is similar in complexity to some of the smaller molecules in the examples, such as CC(O)c1ccccc1 (-0.65933234) and CCC#C (-0.25117445).

Given these observations, the property value for CCCOC=O is likely to be slightly negative, as it is a small molecule with an ester group, which is somewhat polar but not as strongly electron-withdrawing as nitro groups or halogens.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O is approximately -0.3.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.24321410379306704
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a long-chain ester, specifically a decanoate ester, which is similar to other aliphatic esters and long-chain hydrocarbons in the examples.

From the examples, we observe that long-chain hydrocarbons and esters tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule CCCCCC(CC)C=O has a property value of 0.58302392, and CCCOCC has a property value of 0.94146066. Given that CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is a longer chain than these examples, it is reasonable to predict a slightly higher property value due to increased hydrophobic interactions and molecular size.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around 1.0 to 1.2. Let's choose a specific value within this range:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.0325989.
- Molecules with phenol groups, such as Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1, have a property value of -0.68611365.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, have a property value of -0.35317254.

Considering these observations, the presence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro and chloro groups generally leads to lower property values. The combination of these groups in the molecule suggests a property value that is likely negative and possibly close to the values of similar structures with nitro and chloro groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be approximately -0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- Two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -0.66835668.
- Aromatic rings with ether linkages, similar to the structure of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of -0.0325989.
- Sulfur linkages between aromatic rings, which can influence the property value.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of multiple phosphorothioate groups and aromatic rings with ether linkages suggests a property value that is likely negative, but not extremely so.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 would be approximately -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

In the examples, we have a similar structure: Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which is nitrotoluene, with a property value of 0.35360788. The presence of the nitro group in both molecules suggests that they might have similar electronic properties, as the nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group.

Additionally, we have another example, Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, which is a chlorinated phenol, with a property value of 1.12072369. The presence of the hydroxyl group in both molecules suggests some similarity, but the chlorinated phenol has additional electron-withdrawing chlorine atoms, which might increase its property value compared to a nitrophenol.

Considering these comparisons, the property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is likely to be closer to that of nitrotoluene due to the similar influence of the nitro group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be around 0.35360788, similar to the nitrotoluene example.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. This molecule is a complex carbohydrate, likely a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide, characterized by multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages.

From the examples, it appears that molecules with extensive hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, such as sugars and sugar derivatives, tend to have negative property values. This is likely due to their polar nature and the presence of multiple hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, which can influence the property being measured.

Given the structural similarity to other polyhydroxylated compounds and the trend observed in the examples, I would predict that the property value for this molecule is negative. Based on the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value could be around -0.5, considering the extensive hydroxylation and complexity of the structure.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O is approximately -0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of functional groups and structural features, and their property values range widely.

The molecule CCC#C is a simple alkyne, specifically 1-butyne. In the examples, simpler hydrocarbons and molecules with fewer functional groups tend to have property values closer to zero, often negative. For instance, linear alkanes and simple ketones have negative property values.

Given the simplicity of CCC#C and its similarity to other small hydrocarbons, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly negative, reflecting its relatively low complexity and lack of polar functional groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C is approximately -0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of -0.66835668.
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of -0.55675892 and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of -0.74771043.

Considering these structural similarities, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring tends to lower the property value, as seen in the examples. The phosphorothioate group also contributes to a lower property value.

Based on these observations, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be in the range of the examples with similar features, around -0.6 to -0.7. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a pyridine derivative with a carbonyl group attached to a hydrazine moiety.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro or carbonyl groups) tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of nitrogen in heterocycles, such as pyridine, often correlates with negative property values, as seen in examples like Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2 (-0.20954166) and Nc1cccc2ccccc12 (-0.53665385).

Given these observations, the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 has a pyridine ring and a carbonyl group, which are both features associated with negative property values in the examples. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for this molecule.

Considering the examples and the structural features, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be approximately -0.4.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Several alkyl chains

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, have a property value of -0.32740491.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, have a property value of 4.4044163.
- Molecules with piperidine rings, such as CCN2c1cc(N(C)C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23, have a property value of 0.42148447.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values, the presence of both the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage suggests a property value that might be influenced by both the negative and positive contributions of these groups. The piperidine ring might also contribute positively.

Taking into account the balance of these features, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around 0.5.

True Property: -0.531120609793543
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (octane), we can look at the examples provided and identify trends or patterns in the data. The examples include various types of organic molecules, and the property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, such as the presence of functional groups, aromatic rings, and chain length.

In the examples, we have several aliphatic hydrocarbons and alcohols:

- CCC(O)CC has a property value of -0.74756739.
- C/C1CCCCC1\C has a property value of 0.42309607.
- CCCCCCCCO has a property value of -0.53112061.
- CCCCCC1CCCC1 has a property value of 3.18857839.
- CCCC/C=C/C has a property value of -0.7466751.

From these examples, we can see that longer aliphatic chains without functional groups tend to have property values that are slightly negative or positive, depending on the presence of rings or other structural features.

Given that CCCCCCCC is a straight-chain alkane (octane) without any functional groups or rings, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar to other straight-chain alkanes or slightly positive due to its length.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (octane) is approximately 0.2.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as the presence of functional groups, the degree of saturation, aromaticity, and steric effects. The given molecule, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with a ketone group, an alcohol group, and an alkyne group.

From the examples provided, it seems that molecules with multiple rings and functional groups like ketones and alcohols tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O has a property value of 5.65007536, and it shares some structural similarities with the given molecule, such as the presence of multiple rings and a ketone group.

Considering these factors, I would predict that the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is likely to be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 5.5.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and hydroxyl groups, similar to some of the more complex structures in the examples. The presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers and hydroxyls) suggests a potential for a higher property value, as seen in some of the examples with high property values.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing groups, the molecule might exhibit a property value in the higher range. However, without a precise computational model or more specific context, this is a qualitative assessment.

Based on the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule could be around 10.0, considering the structural complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups that could contribute to a higher property value.

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's consider the examples with similar structures:

- Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.35360788.
- Fc1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.21974714.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a phenol with a chlorine substituent. The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) and the chlorine atom (Cl) can influence the property value. The examples with phenol and halogen substituents (like fluorine in Fc1ccccc1) tend to have negative property values, but the presence of additional electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (NO2) can increase the property value.

Considering the structure of Oc1ccccc1Cl and the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be slightly negative, similar to the example with fluorine. Therefore, a predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl could be around -0.1.

- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C)
- An ester linkage (OC(=O))
- An amide linkage (NC(=O))

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens tend to have negative property values, such as Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (-0.68611365) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (-0.69660029).
- Molecules with ester and amide linkages, such as O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (3.86502531), tend to have positive property values, but these are often larger structures with multiple aromatic rings.

Considering the balance of these features, the presence of both electron-withdrawing groups (Cl, C=O) and the aromatic ring suggests a property value that is likely negative, but not as low as highly chlorinated aromatic compounds due to the presence of the ester and amide linkages.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around -0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2) attached to the central carbon.
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have property values around 0 to 1.
- The presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles (like pyrimidine) can slightly increase the property value.
- The presence of multiple chlorine atoms can either increase or decrease the property value depending on the overall structure.

Considering these observations, the molecule has features that are similar to those with property values slightly above zero. The presence of the pyrimidine ring and the phenol group might increase the property value slightly compared to simple chlorinated aromatics.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl would be around 0.5.

The structure of CCCCCOC=O is similar to CCCCCCC=O, but with one fewer carbon in the alkyl chain. The presence of the ester functional group (OC=O) is a common feature, and the overall structure suggests similar properties. Given the trend that longer alkyl chains in esters tend to have slightly more negative property values, we can predict that CCCCCOC=O will have a property value slightly less negative than CCCCCCC=O.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be approximately -0.5.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- Oc1cccc(O)c1 with a property value of 0.0, which is phenol.
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O with a property value of 0.06530943, which is a methylated phenol with an additional alkyl group.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is similar to phenol but with a methyl group, which might slightly increase the property value compared to phenol due to the additional alkyl group. However, it is less complex than the example with a property value of 0.06530943, which has additional alkyl groups.

Considering these factors, the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is likely to be slightly above 0.0 but below 0.06530943. A reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be approximately 0.05.

- Clc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.35360788.

The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a simpler structure compared to the first two examples, as it has fewer chlorine atoms and no additional functional groups like nitro groups. The property values for the first two examples are negative, indicating that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms tends to result in negative property values.

Given the structural similarity to the first two examples and the trend observed, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl will also be negative and likely close to the values of the first two examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is approximately -0.7.

To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane), we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The examples suggest that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have positive property values, often related to their electron-withdrawing nature and potential for higher molecular weight or density.

For instance, the molecule ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of 4.68268496, and ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl) has a property value of 0.50413158. These examples indicate that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms can lead to a positive property value.

Given that ClCCl is a relatively simple molecule with two chlorine atoms, it is likely to have a positive property value, but not as high as those with more complex structures or additional chlorine atoms. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around 0.5.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 11.051890429511944
Predicted Property:
Predicting the specific property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples. The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and hydroxyl groups, as well as aromatic rings.

From the examples provided, it seems that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the overall complexity of the molecular structure. For instance, molecules with multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms tend to have higher property values, while simpler aliphatic compounds tend to have lower values.

Given the complexity of the molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, which includes multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and hydroxyl groups, it is reasonable to predict a relatively high property value. However, without a clear understanding of the specific property being measured, this prediction is speculative.

Based on the examples and the structural complexity, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule could be around 5.0. This is an estimate based on the presence of multiple aromatic systems and functional groups that are likely to contribute to a higher property value.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 1.9671004719470413
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) atoms, along with the carbonyl group (C=O), suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and polar interactions, which can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar functional groups and heteroatoms tend to have property values around the range of -0.5 to 0.5. For instance, the molecule CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a property value of 0.34836948, which is somewhat similar in terms of functional groups and structure.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be around 0.3. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is:

0.3

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.7481375324844985
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ester group (COOC) attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings, such as benzene derivatives, tend to have property values around the range of -0.7 to 0.3. For instance, the molecule CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of -0.74716237, and it contains a benzene ring with carbonyl groups. Another example, Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, has a property value of 0.35360788 and also contains a benzene ring with a nitro group.

Considering the structure of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, which is similar to these examples but with an ester group instead of a ketone or nitro group, we can predict that its property value will be in a similar range. The presence of the ester group might slightly increase the property value compared to a ketone, but it is still likely to be negative or close to zero due to the aromatic ring.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is around -0.3.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.531120609793543
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the length of carbon chains, and the presence of halogens.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached, making it a bromoalkane. In the examples, linear alkanes and their derivatives tend to have negative property values, often around -0.5 to -0.7. For instance, CCCCCCCCO has a property value of -0.53112061, and CCCCCCC=C has a value of -0.68555259.

Considering the presence of the bromine atom, which is a halogen, it might slightly alter the property value compared to a simple alkane. However, the examples with halogens, such as Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, have a property value of -0.68611365, indicating that the presence of bromine does not drastically change the property value from that of a similar alkane.

Based on this analysis, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be slightly negative, similar to other linear alkanes and their derivatives. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr is approximately:

-0.65

SMILES: CO
True Property: 17.007403896547604
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of organic and inorganic compounds with different functional groups and structural complexities. The property values range from highly negative to highly positive.

Carbon monoxide is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is a small, non-polar molecule with no additional functional groups or complex structures. In the given examples, smaller and simpler molecules, such as CCC (propane) and CCBr (bromoethane), have relatively high positive property values, while more complex or polar molecules tend to have negative values.

Given the simplicity and non-polar nature of CO, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is closer to the positive end of the spectrum, similar to other small, non-polar molecules. However, CO is also known for its unique bonding and electronic properties, which might influence its property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO would be slightly positive, but not as high as the values for larger non-polar hydrocarbons like CCC. Therefore, a predicted property value for CO could be around:

1.0
