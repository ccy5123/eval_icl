SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -1.3581273801943898
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the trends and patterns from the given examples. The molecule in question is a linear aliphatic ester, specifically a decanoate ester.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Linear aliphatic chains tend to have negative property values, with longer chains generally having more negative values.
- Esters, such as COC(=O)c1cccnc1 (-0.38413865) and CCOC(=O)CC (0.2853058), show a range of values, but the presence of an ester group does not necessarily lead to a positive value.
- The molecule CCCCCCCC(C)O has a property value of -2.1121991, indicating that longer aliphatic chains with functional groups can have significantly negative values.

Given that CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a decanoate ester, it is likely to have a property value that is negative, similar to other long-chain aliphatic compounds. Considering the trends, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be around -1.5.

True Property: -1.251062122089329
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxo group and a nitrogen atom. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings and heteroatoms.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl and carbonyl groups) tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tends to result in more negative values.
- The presence of heteroatoms like nitrogen and oxygen in a ring can also influence the property value, often making it more negative.

Given these observations, the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 has a chlorinated aromatic ring with an oxo group and a nitrogen atom, which suggests a negative property value. However, it does not have as many electron-withdrawing groups as some of the more negative examples.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around -0.5.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.5473444099133413
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an isopropyl group (CC(C)). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have negative property values. The presence of the nitro group, which is electron-withdrawing, generally contributes to a more negative property value.

Considering the examples and the structural features of CC(C)N(=O)=O, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -1.0. This is based on the trend observed in the examples where nitro-containing compounds tend to have negative values, and the relatively simple structure of isopropyl nitrite compared to more complex aromatic nitro compounds.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is approximately -1.0.

From the examples, we can observe that complex polycyclic structures with carbonyl groups, such as CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C, tend to have positive property values. The example provided has a property value of 1.16721652.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of multiple rings and carbonyl groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for the given molecule will also be positive and in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO would be approximately 1.1.

- A chlorobenzene moiety (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), which is similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of -0.47685279.

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like fluorine and chlorine, along with the amide linkage, suggests a tendency towards a negative property value. The examples with similar features tend to have negative values, often in the range of -0.5 to -1.5.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be around -0.8.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with an alkyl chain. It is similar in structure to some of the examples, particularly those with simple alkyl chains and ethers. For instance, the molecule CCCC(C)CO has a property value of 0.0, and CCCCCO has a property value of 0.30412891. These examples suggest that simple ethers and alkyl chains tend to have property values around zero or slightly positive.

Given the structure of CCCOC(C)C, which is a small ether with a branched alkyl group, it is reasonable to predict a property value close to these examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C would be approximately 0.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Alkyl Chain**: The presence of an alkyl chain (CCC(C)-) is similar to other alkyl chains in the examples, which generally have a small positive or negative contribution to the property value.

2. **Pyrrole Ring**: The pyrrole ring is a five-membered aromatic heterocycle containing nitrogen. In the examples, heterocycles like pyrrole and thiophene (e.g., Nc1nccs1, c1ccoc1) tend to have positive property values.

3. **Carbonyl Groups**: The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) can have a significant impact. In the examples, molecules with carbonyl groups (e.g., O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC, CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1) often have negative property values, especially when they are part of amide or ketone functionalities.

4. **Bromine Substitution**: The presence of a bromine atom (Br) is similar to the example CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, which has a very negative property value. Halogen substitutions can significantly affect the property, often leading to more negative values.

Considering these factors, the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of carbonyl groups and bromine, despite the potential positive contribution from the pyrrole ring and alkyl chain.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -1.5.

True Property: -2.134997770831975
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is biphenyl, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. This structure is similar to the example c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67, which is a larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a property value of 1.54353199. Another similar structure is Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34, which is a naphthalene derivative with a property value of 0.91257466.

Biphenyl is less complex than these larger polycyclic structures, but it still has significant aromatic character. Based on the trend that larger and more complex aromatic systems tend to have higher property values, we can infer that biphenyl will have a positive property value, but likely lower than the larger polycyclic examples.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around 0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of molecular structures, and their property values seem to be influenced by factors such as the presence of functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear alkane chain with a terminal sulfur atom. In the examples, linear alkanes and similar structures tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCCCCCC=C has a property value of -1.64392589, and CCC1CCCCC1 has a property value of -0.52144302. The presence of sulfur, which is more electronegative than carbon, might slightly affect the property value compared to a simple alkane.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCCCS is likely to be negative, similar to other linear alkanes, but possibly slightly more negative due to the presence of sulfur. A reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be around -1.5.

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.40433668407084516
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol, specifically 2-methyl-2-pentanol. In the examples, we have several aliphatic and alcohol-containing molecules:

1. CCC(C)(C)C (2,2-dimethylbutane) has a property value of 0.10222302.
2. CC(C)CC(C)O (2-methyl-2-butanol) has a property value of 0.00165589.
3. CCCC(C)(O)CC (2-methyl-3-hexanol) has a property value of -0.40927309.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is similar to these examples, particularly to 2-methyl-3-hexanol, which is also a branched alcohol. The presence of the hydroxyl group and the branching in the carbon chain are key features that influence the property value.

Given the similarity to 2-methyl-3-hexanol, which has a property value of -0.40927309, and considering the slight structural differences, we can predict that the property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO will be in a similar range, likely slightly higher due to the additional branching.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO is approximately -0.35.

The structure of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is a naphthalene ring system without any additional substituents, which is simpler than the example with a methyl group. Given that the presence of a methyl group in the example molecule results in a negative property value, and considering the general trend of aromatic hydrocarbons in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 will also be negative, but likely less negative than the example with the methyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 would be around -1.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a cyclic compound with a diketopiperazine core, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -1.95019216. The main difference is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the given molecule, which could potentially affect the property value.

Considering the structural similarity and the influence of the additional alkyl chain, the property value is likely to be in the same range as the example, but slightly less negative due to the increased hydrophobicity from the alkyl chain.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be approximately -1.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group, which is electron-withdrawing, can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, we see that molecules with halogen substituents on aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1 (-1.81240408) and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (0.85772694), have varying property values depending on the number and type of halogens and their positions.

Given that trifluoromethyl is a strong electron-withdrawing group, it is likely to have a significant impact on the property value. However, the presence of only one such group on the benzene ring suggests a moderate effect compared to multiple halogen substitutions.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around -0.5 to -1.0, reflecting the electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group and its influence on the aromatic system.

Therefore, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.75.

To predict the property value for the molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a sugar alcohol, specifically a form of glucose, which is a polyol. It contains multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups, which are known to contribute to hydrophilicity and can affect the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a property value of -0.68037757. This suggests that the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups tends to result in a negative property value, likely due to increased hydrophilicity and hydrogen bonding potential.

Given the structural similarity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O would be similar to that of other polyols. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately -0.68.

CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C

This molecule contains several key features:

1. **Ester Groups**: The presence of two ester groups (CC(=O)O and CC(=O)) suggests some degree of polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, which can influence the property value.

2. **Steroidal Backbone**: The structure includes a steroid-like backbone, similar to some of the examples provided, such as CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of 1.34011897.

3. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (C3(O) and C(O)) can increase polarity and hydrogen bonding capability, potentially affecting the property value.

4. **Cyclohexane Rings**: The presence of multiple cyclohexane rings contributes to the overall hydrophobic character, which can lower the property value.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, particularly the one with a similar steroidal structure, the property value is likely to be positive due to the balance of hydrophobic and polar features, as well as the structural similarity to the example with a positive property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately **1.3**.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O 
True Property: 0.8887072716788379
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as the presence of functional groups, the overall molecular geometry, and the electronic effects of substituents. The examples provided suggest that the property values are influenced by these factors, possibly related to a physicochemical property like solubility, partition coefficient, or a similar descriptor.

The molecule in question, CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O, appears to be a polycyclic compound with a ketone group and an alcohol group. This structure is somewhat similar to steroid-like frameworks, which often have moderate to high lipophilicity due to their polycyclic nature and limited polar functional groups.

Given the examples, particularly those with similar structural complexity and functional groups, the property value is likely to be positive, indicating a certain degree of lipophilicity or hydrophobicity. The presence of the ketone and alcohol groups might slightly reduce this value compared to a completely non-polar polycyclic structure.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O would be approximately 0.7.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O contains an acetamide group (CC(=O)N) attached to a nitro-substituted benzene ring. This structure is similar to the example O=N(=O)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.1548329. The presence of the acetamide group might slightly alter the property, but the overall electronic and steric effects are likely to be similar due to the nitro group on the benzene ring.

Considering the examples and the structural similarities, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is likely to be close to that of O=N(=O)c1ccccc1. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately -0.15.

True Property: 1.1589017319637231
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is not directly represented in the examples but is somewhat similar to carbonyl groups (C=O) in terms of electron-withdrawing effects.
- An aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent, which is present in several examples with varying effects on the property value.
- An ester linkage (C-O-C), which is present in some examples with positive property values.
- A thioether linkage (S-C), which is less common in the examples but can be compared to ether linkages.

Considering these features:
- The presence of the phosphorothioate group and the aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent suggests a potential for a negative property value, as seen in some examples with halogenated aromatics.
- The ester linkage might contribute positively, but the overall structure, including the thioether, suggests a more complex interaction.

Based on these considerations and the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be slightly negative, around -0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CC(C)(C)CO is a simple alcohol with a tertiary butyl group, which is similar in structure to some of the examples provided.

Looking at the examples, we see that simple alcohols and hydrocarbons tend to have property values that are relatively low or negative, but not extremely so. For instance, CC(C)CO has a property value of 0.55753724, and CCCCCCC(C)O has a property value of -2.1121991. The presence of the alcohol group (OH) generally contributes to a lower property value compared to hydrocarbons without functional groups.

Given that CC(C)(C)CO is a small molecule with a tertiary butyl group and an alcohol group, it is likely to have a property value that is not too far from the example of CC(C)CO. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO would be around 0.5, considering the influence of the alcohol group and the size of the molecule.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Esters like CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC and CCCOC(C)C have negative property values (-1.38311605 and -0.01676695, respectively).
- Molecules with small alkyl groups and oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have negative or slightly positive values.

Given that CC(C)OC=O is a small ester with a simple structure, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly negative, similar to other small esters in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O is approximately -0.1.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings, such as benzene derivatives, tend to have property values around -0.1 to -0.3. For instance, Oc1ccccc1Cl has a property value of -0.15656388, and NC(=O)c1cccnc1 has a property value of -0.12619149. These examples suggest that the presence of aromatic rings contributes to a slightly negative property value.

The urea linkage (O=C-NH-C=O) in the molecule might also influence the property value. In the examples, molecules with carbonyl groups (C=O) and amide linkages (N-C=O) tend to have negative property values, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 with -7.60011593 and CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O with -3.9745725. However, these examples have additional structural features that contribute to their more negative values.

Considering the structure of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, which is relatively simple with two phenyl rings and a urea linkage, the property value is likely to be slightly negative, similar to other aromatic compounds with carbonyl and amide groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 would be around -0.2.

Given that triphenylene is a smaller but still significant aromatic system, we can expect its property value to be positive, but likely lower than that of the larger polycyclic system mentioned above. Considering the trend and the structural similarity, a reasonable prediction for the property value of triphenylene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13) would be around 0.5.

2. **Aromatic Ring**: 
   - The presence of an aromatic ring can contribute to the stability and electronic properties of the molecule.

3. **Substituents**: 
   - The combination of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups can influence the overall electronic distribution in the molecule.

4. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - Molecules with strong electron-withdrawing groups, like nitro groups, tend to have more negative property values.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.6697023508216349
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with negative property values.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which can also contribute to a negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
- An alkene group (C=C) attached to the nitrogen, which is less common in the examples but can influence the property value.
- An amine group (CCN) which is present in several examples with both positive and negative property values, depending on the context.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, the presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and trifluoromethyl) suggests a tendency towards a negative property value. The examples with similar electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro and halogens, often have negative values.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value for the given molecule to be approximately -0.8.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.5396646760523234
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. It has a relatively simple structure with a small alkyl group (isopropyl) and a formate group. In the examples, we have:

- CC(C)CCOC=O, which has a property value of -0.02380443. This molecule is similar in that it is an ester with a slightly larger alkyl group.
- CCC(C)(C)O, which has a property value of 0.30544096. This is a tertiary alcohol, which is somewhat similar in terms of the presence of an alkyl group and an oxygen-containing functional group.

Considering the structural similarity to CC(C)CCOC=O and the fact that esters generally have property values around this range, we can predict that CC(C)OC=O will have a property value close to that of CC(C)CCOC=O.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O is approximately -0.02.

Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.6042712133374376
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 can be compared to c1ccccc1O (phenol), which has a property value of 0.21166789. The presence of an additional methyl group in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 might slightly alter the property value due to increased hydrophobicity and potential electronic effects.

Considering the examples, the presence of additional alkyl groups generally tends to decrease the property value slightly, as seen in other similar aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions. Therefore, the property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is likely to be slightly lower than that of phenol.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be approximately 0.1.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.3911140654574108
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)O), which is similar to the phosphorothioate groups in the examples COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl. The property values for these molecules are 0.45654677, 0.69896613, and 0.30528952, respectively.

The molecule also contains a benzene ring with substituents: a methoxy group (OC), a thiomethyl group (SC), and a methyl group (C). The presence of these groups can influence the property value, but the overall structure is still dominated by the phosphorothioate group and the aromatic ring.

Considering the examples and the structural similarities, the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be in a similar range to the other phosphorothioate-containing molecules. Given the presence of the thiomethyl group, which is less electronegative than halogens, the property value might be slightly lower than those with halogen substituents.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is approximately 0.35.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a chlorinated biphenyl, similar to some of the examples given.

The molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.85772694, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1.04003716. Both of these molecules are highly chlorinated aromatic compounds, similar to the target molecule.

Given the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is likely to be close to these values. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 0.9.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.5462543151417629
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a nitroalkane, specifically a nitropropane.

From the examples, we can observe that nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have a significant impact on the property values, often leading to positive values. For instance, the molecule CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.67393481, and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O has a value of -2.76185978, indicating that the presence of multiple nitro groups can lead to a wide range of values depending on the rest of the structure.

In the case of CCCN(=O)=O, the molecule is relatively simple with a single nitro group attached to a short alkyl chain. Comparing with simpler structures like CCC, which has a property value of 0.82175121, and considering the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group, we can expect the property value to be somewhat lower than that of a simple alkane but still positive.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 0.5.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.24283356723373453
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, which is similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's consider the examples with similar structures:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1: -0.80721655
- COc1cccc(Cl)c1: -0.65590597
- COc1ccccc1Cl: -0.65590597
- Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O: -0.63484478

These examples suggest that halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have negative property values. The presence of both fluorine and bromine, which are electronegative and electron-withdrawing, might further influence the property value to be negative.

Given these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be around -0.7. This is consistent with the trend observed in similar halogenated aromatic compounds.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -2.1819766948375245
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as the presence of functional groups, the size and shape of the molecule, and the electronic effects of substituents. The examples provided show a range of property values for different types of molecules, including aliphatic and aromatic compounds, as well as those with various functional groups like halogens, carbonyls, and heterocycles.

The molecule in question, CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles some of the cyclic and bicyclic structures in the examples, such as CC1CCCO1 (0.41628848) and CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2 (1.50290105), but without the additional complexity of aromatic rings or multiple functional groups.

Given the presence of a tertiary alcohol and the bicyclic structure, the property value is likely to be positive but not extremely high, as seen in some of the more complex or highly functionalized examples. Considering the examples and the structural features of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.5. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is approximately 0.5.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 0.5281381169167167
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 1.33191501. The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of the SC(CCl) group in the example, which is replaced by a simpler structure in the molecule we are analyzing.

The removal of the SC(CCl) group, which contains a sulfur atom and a chlorine atom, might slightly decrease the property value due to the loss of these electronegative and polarizable atoms. However, the core structure remains similar, with the phosphorothioate group and the bicyclic lactam structure.

Considering these structural similarities and differences, I would predict a slightly lower property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O compared to the example. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 1.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzamide with a phenyl group attached to a nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of 0.64052431. Both molecules contain aromatic rings and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, but the example molecule is more complex with additional aromatic rings and a ketone group.

Considering the structural similarities and the presence of aromatic rings and nitrogen heterocycles, the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is likely to be positive but lower than 0.64052431 due to its simpler structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around 0.4.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -1.0563397461760424
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which is a linear chain with a total of 9 carbon atoms.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCCCC(=O)OC, which is a similar ester with a slightly different structure, has a property value of -3.18600449.
- CCCCCCCCI, a linear chain with an iodine atom, has a property value of -3.9362095.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar to CCCCCCC(=O)OC, but with an additional ethyl group instead of a methyl group. This additional ethyl group might slightly increase the property value due to the increased chain length and potential changes in molecular interactions.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would likely be slightly higher than -3.18600449. A reasonable estimate could be around -3.0.

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6285043486288615
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is methyl benzoate, an ester with a benzene ring. In the examples, we have several molecules with aromatic rings and ester groups:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1, with a property value of -1.78089483.
2. CCOC(=O)c1cncn1C(C)c2ccccc2, with a property value of 0.18258723.
3. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, with a property value of -1.3645696.

The third example, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, is ethyl benzoate, which is structurally very similar to methyl benzoate, differing only by one carbon in the alkyl chain of the ester group. The property value for ethyl benzoate is -1.3645696.

Given the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, the property value for methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1) is likely to be close to that of ethyl benzoate. Therefore, I predict the property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 to be approximately -1.3645696.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.3962586717082646
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the overall molecular structure.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear chain with two double bonds, making it a conjugated diene. In the examples, simple alkenes and alkynes tend to have property values around the range of -0.5 to 0.5, depending on their specific structure and substituents.

For instance, the molecule CC/C=C/C has a property value of 0.39102142, which is a simple alkene. The molecule C=Cc1ccccc1, which is a styrene-like structure, has a property value of -0.48457973. These examples suggest that simple unsaturated hydrocarbons without additional functional groups tend to have property values near zero.

Given that C=CCC=C is a simple conjugated diene without additional functional groups, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be close to zero, likely slightly positive due to the conjugation.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C is approximately 0.2.

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.04360941315453432
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular size and complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br, also known as bromoform, is a small, simple molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples provided, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly bromine, tend to have negative property values. For instance, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of -2.22700695, and Ic1cccc2ccccc12 has a property value of -0.98306733. These examples suggest that the presence of multiple halogen atoms, especially in a small molecule, might lead to a more negative property value.

Considering the simplicity and high halogen content of BrC(Br)Br, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Given the trend observed in the examples, a value around -2.5 could be a reasonable estimate for BrC(Br)Br.

Therefore, the predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br is approximately -2.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 1.28369402.
- An amide linkage (N-C=O), which is present in several molecules with varying property values.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is a feature in several molecules with both positive and negative property values.
- A phenyl ring, which is common in many of the examples.

Given the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the structural similarity to the example with a property value of 1.28369402, we can infer that the property value for this molecule is likely to be positive and in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is approximately 1.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Functional Groups and Structural Features:**
   - The molecule contains an amide group (C(=O)N), which is present in several examples with varying property values.
   - It has a chloro-substituted aromatic ring, similar to some examples with negative property values.
   - The molecule also contains a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen, which can influence the property value.
   - The presence of a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C) can contribute to a more positive property value due to its hydrophobic nature.

2. **Comparison with Examples:**
   - Molecules with chloro-substituted aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-0.6687127) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (-2.81070472), tend to have negative property values.
   - Molecules with amide groups, such as CN(C)C(=O)C (0.43153129) and CCC(=O)CC (0.36371755), have positive property values.
   - The presence of a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen, as seen in Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2 (-0.77363039), can lead to a negative property value.

3. **Prediction:**
   - Considering the balance of these features, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative due to the influence of the chloro-substituted aromatic ring and the heterocyclic ring, but not as negative as some of the more heavily substituted examples.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be around -0.5.

True Property: 0.2597823803126098
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which is similar to some of the other chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.

Looking at the examples, we have:
- Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl with a property value of -0.67127911
- c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2 with a property value of -0.94789078
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 with a property value of -0.33648783
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl with a property value of -5.09537436

The molecule in question, Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, has two chlorinated phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms and the ether linkage suggests that the property value might be influenced by both the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine atoms and the electron-donating effect of the ether linkage.

Given the examples, the property values for chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to be negative, with more chlorines generally leading to more negative values. However, the ether linkage might moderate this effect slightly.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be around -1.0. This accounts for the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorines and the electron-donating effect of the ether linkage, placing it in a similar range to other chlorinated aromatic compounds.

SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.39102141977369026
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC/C=C\C, we can look at the examples provided and identify similar structures and their associated property values. The molecule CC/C=C\C is a linear alkene with four carbon atoms, also known as 2-butene.

In the examples, the molecule CC/C=C/C, which is also 2-butene but with a different stereochemistry (trans-2-butene), has a property value of 0.39102142. Since the stereochemistry (cis vs. trans) can affect the property value, but the core structure is the same, we can expect the property value for CC/C=C\C (cis-2-butene) to be similar but potentially slightly different due to the stereochemical difference.

Considering the examples and the typical impact of stereochemistry on such properties, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC/C=C\C (cis-2-butene) would be close to that of trans-2-butene. Therefore, a predicted property value for CC/C=C\C could be approximately 0.39, acknowledging that the exact value might vary slightly due to the stereochemical difference.

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 0.293753259868807
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOCC is a linear chain with an ether functional group, similar to some of the simpler structures in the examples.

Looking at the examples, simpler aliphatic chains and ethers tend to have property values around the range of 0.3 to 0.6. For instance, CCC(O)CC has a property value of 0.30544096, and CC(C)O has a property value of 0.76473442. The presence of the ether group (O) in CCCOCC might slightly lower the property value compared to a simple alkane, but it should still be in a similar range.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be around 0.4.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a tertiary amide with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 0.97096049. Both molecules contain a tertiary amide and phenyl groups, although the example has an additional heterocyclic component.

Another similar example is C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -0.50319576. This molecule is a simple diphenylmethane, lacking the amide functionality present in the target molecule.

Considering the presence of the amide group, which can influence the property value due to its polar nature, and the similarity to the example with a positive property value, we can infer that the target molecule might have a positive property value, but likely not as high as the example with the heterocyclic component.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be around 0.5.

True Property: -7.600115934111079
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-), which is a common feature in several molecules.
- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1), which is also present in some of the examples.

From the examples:
- Molecules with bromobenzene rings, such as Fc1cccc(Br)c1 (-0.24283357) and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.40762555), tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of an acetamide group, as seen in CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (0.47384692), can contribute to a positive property value, but this is in a different context with additional aromatic rings.

Considering these factors, the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative due to the influence of the bromobenzene moiety, but not as negative as molecules with multiple bromine atoms or other strongly negative features.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around -0.3.

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -2.0848534333399713
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is isobutylbenzene, which consists of an isobutyl group (CC(C)C) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1).

Looking at the examples, we can find similar structures:

1. CCc1ccc(C)cc1, with a property value of -1.01998383, is a propylbenzene.
2. CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1, with a property value of -2.19493433, is a tert-butylbenzene.

The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is structurally between these two examples, as it has an isobutyl group instead of a propyl or tert-butyl group. The isobutyl group is slightly bulkier than the propyl group but less so than the tert-butyl group.

Given this, we can predict that the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 will be between -1.01998383 and -2.19493433. A reasonable estimate would be around -1.5, considering the intermediate bulkiness and electronic effects of the isobutyl group compared to the examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is approximately -1.5.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.05159531359236796
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have more negative property values. In contrast, compounds with electron-donating groups or less polar functional groups tend to have less negative or even positive property values.

Benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, but not as strongly as nitro groups. Comparing it to similar structures in the examples, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (-0.4946276) and COc1ccccc1 (-0.14617854), we can infer that benzaldehyde's property value will likely be negative but not as negative as those with multiple strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) would be around -0.2 to -0.3. Therefore, a specific predicted value could be approximately -0.25.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -1.7036816069816887
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring, similar to some of the examples. The presence of the nitro group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, often contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in some examples like Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 (-1.25106212) and NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1 (-3.07411649).

Additionally, the molecule contains a lactam (cyclic amide) structure, which can also influence the property value. The presence of heteroatoms like oxygen and nitrogen in the ring can further affect the property, potentially making it more negative.

Considering these factors and comparing with the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be around -1.5. This accounts for the electron-withdrawing effects of the nitro group and the influence of the heterocyclic structure.

True Property: -0.5213240612743102
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings, such as c1ccc2c(c1)ccc3c2ccc4c5ccccc5ccc43 (1.32886944) and c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 (1.54353199), tend to have higher property values.
- The molecule N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which is similar in structure to the target molecule but with a different connecting group, has a property value of -0.92139193.

Considering the structural similarity of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, and the fact that the hydrazine group might slightly alter the electronic properties compared to the azo group, we can expect the property value to be in a similar range but potentially slightly different due to the different electronic effects of the hydrazine group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be around -0.9.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -1.4045544537187122
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a relatively small and rigid structure with two amide groups and a cyclohexane ring. In the examples, similar cyclic structures with amide groups, such as O=C1N(COC(=O)CC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (1.14893171) and O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC (-0.7213568), show a range of property values.

Considering the structural similarity to these examples, particularly the presence of amide groups and a cyclic structure, the property value is likely to be influenced by these features. The diketopiperazine structure is more similar to the second example, which has a negative property value, but it is less complex and lacks the additional substituents that might further lower the value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 would be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the amide groups and the cyclic structure, but not as negative as the more complex example. A predicted value could be around -0.5.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.07830232425245458
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Clc1ccccc1Cl (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of -0.47685279.
2. Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (a more complex chlorinated aromatic compound) has a property value of 0.97346467.

The target molecule, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is less complex than the second example but more complex than the first, as it has three chlorine atoms and a biphenyl structure. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value compared to a single chlorinated benzene ring.

Considering these factors, the property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is likely to be slightly higher than that of Clc1ccccc1Cl but not as high as the more complex chlorinated compound. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 0.1 to 0.3.

Given the examples and the structural analysis, a specific predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl could be approximately 0.2.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -2.1669278124562092
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples.

Looking at the examples, we have:
- Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) with a property value of -0.3856455
- Cc1ccccc1N (ethylbenzene) with a property value of -0.19956551

Both of these molecules are aromatic and have alkyl or amine substitutions. The property values for these molecules are slightly negative, indicating that the presence of the aromatic ring and the substituents contribute to a small negative property value.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is ethylbenzene, which is structurally similar to the examples provided, we can predict that its property value will also be slightly negative, similar to the value for ethylbenzene.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is approximately -0.199.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is a sulfonamide derivative, which contains a benzene ring (phenyl group) attached to a sulfonamide group. In the examples, we have several molecules with aromatic rings and various functional groups, including nitro groups, sulfonamide groups, and other electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups.

The presence of the sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is similar to the nitro group (N(=O)=O) in terms of being an electron-withdrawing group, which can influence the electronic properties of the molecule. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups attached to aromatic rings tend to have negative property values, such as:

- Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O: -0.59568616
- Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O: -1.91232108

Given the structural similarity and the electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonamide group, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O will also be negative, but likely less negative than the dinitro compound due to the presence of only one sulfonamide group.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be around -0.6.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically triphenylene. It is similar in structure to the example c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54, which is a larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a property value of 1.00339066.

Triphenylene is smaller and less complex than the example provided, which suggests that its property value might be slightly lower due to the reduced size and complexity. However, it still retains a significant degree of aromaticity and conjugation, which are factors that contribute positively to the property value.

Considering these aspects, a reasonable prediction for the property value of triphenylene (c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34) would be around 0.9.

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the structures in the examples, particularly those with multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups, which tend to have higher property values.

For instance, the molecule OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5 has a property value of 2.19473587, and it contains multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups. Similarly, Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 has a property value of 1.07373526, and it also features multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings, the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 is likely to be positive and relatively high.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately 1.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (property value: 0.30528952) and CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C (property value: 1.26724493).
- An amide group (NC(C)=O), which is present in several molecules with varying property values, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (-2.40875407) and CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCCCC2 (-0.43163069).

Considering the presence of the phosphorothioate group, which tends to increase the property value, and the amide group, which can have a neutral or slightly negative effect, the property value is likely to be positive but not as high as the examples with more complex aromatic systems.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around 0.5.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.609458681731124
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, relatively simple molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with halogen atoms, particularly chlorine, tend to have a range of property values. For instance:

- Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of -0.67127911.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.85772694.
- Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of -0.41356646.

These examples suggest that the presence of chlorine atoms can lead to both positive and negative property values, depending on the overall structure and other functional groups present.

Given that Cl\C=C/Cl is a small molecule with two chlorine atoms and no other functional groups, it is likely to have a property value that is not too extreme. Considering the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be slightly negative, as it lacks the complexity or additional functional groups that might push the value higher.

Therefore, a predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl could be around -0.5.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitrogen atoms, such as pyridine derivatives, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the compound c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 has a property value of -0.92383438, and Cc1ncnc2nccnc12 has a property value of -0.91085937.

Considering the structural similarity of pyridine to these examples and the trend of negative values for nitrogen-containing aromatic rings, we can predict that the property value for c1ccncc1 (pyridine) will also be negative.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccncc1 is approximately -0.9.

The molecule contains:
- An ester group (COC(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)
- An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23)
- A pyridine-like structure (ccnc)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of an ester group often contributes to a negative property value.
- Amide linkages also tend to contribute to negative property values.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value. Comparing it to similar structures in the examples, such as CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2 (-1.06459151) and CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1OC(C)C (-0.88682188), which have similar functional groups and aromatic content, we can estimate the property value.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple aromatic rings and a chlorine atom, the property value is likely to be more negative than -1.0 but not as negative as the highly chlorinated aromatic compound Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl (-5.09537436).

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 would be approximately -1.5.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 0.3041289147921487
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a terminal hydroxyl group, making it a primary alcohol (1-pentanol).

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Linear alkanes and simple hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCCCCC (hexane) has a property value of -1.77904058.
- Molecules with functional groups like alcohols or esters can have positive or slightly negative values, depending on the structure and other substituents. For example, COC=O (methyl formate) has a property value of 0.93296994, and CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C (a complex ester) has a property value of 1.5333199.

Given that CCCCCO is a simple alcohol, we can expect its property value to be slightly negative or close to zero, as it is less complex than the esters and has a polar hydroxyl group.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is often associated with polar and electron-withdrawing characteristics.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which can also contribute to polarity and hydrogen bonding.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which is common in many of the examples and can influence the property depending on its substitution pattern.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can add to the molecule's polarity.

From the examples, molecules with polar functional groups like sulfonyl, carbonyl, and amide tend to have property values that are either slightly positive or negative, depending on the overall balance of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups.

Considering these factors, the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative due to the presence of the sulfonyl and amide groups, which are electron-withdrawing, balanced by the aromatic ring and ether linkage.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as functional groups, aromaticity, steric effects, and electronic effects. The given molecule is:

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:
- An ester group (COC(=O))
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring
- A heterocyclic ring with nitrogen
- Aromatic rings

From the examples provided, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values, likely due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group. The presence of ester groups can also influence the property value, often contributing to a more negative value due to their polar nature.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.5 to -1.0. Given the complexity and the presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups, I would predict a specific property value of approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two amide groups and a cyclohexane-like structure due to the cyclization of the peptide bond. This structure is relatively small and compact, with polar amide groups that can engage in hydrogen bonding.

Looking at the examples, molecules with amide groups and cyclic structures tend to have property values around the range of -0.5 to 0.7. For instance, the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of -1.46193035, and OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O has a property value of 0.70158744.

Considering the compact and polar nature of the diketopiperazine, it is likely to have a property value closer to the lower end of this range due to its smaller size and lack of additional aromatic or bulky groups that might increase the property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.5.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure consisting of a chloroethane group. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons like CCCCC have a positive property value (0.38576308), while aromatic chlorinated compounds like Clc1ccccc1 have a slightly negative property value (-0.02234793). The presence of chlorine in ClCC suggests that it might have a property value closer to the slightly negative range, similar to other chlorinated compounds.

Considering the simplicity of ClCC and the influence of the chlorine atom, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be slightly negative, but not as negative as more complex chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a predicted property value for ClCC could be approximately -0.1.

The molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a pyridine ring and a trichloromethyl group. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms and a nitrogen atom in the aromatic ring suggests that the molecule might have a property value similar to other chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.

Looking at the examples:

- ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O has a property value of 0.54064377.

The molecule in question has a pyridine ring, which is similar to the benzene ring in Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2, but with a nitrogen atom. The trichloromethyl group is similar to the ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl) group in ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O.

Considering these structural similarities and the range of property values for chlorinated aromatic compounds, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl would be around -0.5. This value accounts for the electron-withdrawing effects of the chlorine atoms and the nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring, which are likely to lower the property value compared to less substituted aromatic compounds.

True Property: -0.003620153594649705
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCC(C)O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCCC(C)O is a primary alcohol with a six-carbon chain, also known as 2-hexanol. 

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCC(O)CCC, which is a similar alcohol with a longer carbon chain, has a property value of -0.40927309.
- CCC(C)CCO, which is a similar alcohol with a shorter carbon chain, has a property value of 0.0.

The property values for alcohols in the examples seem to be around zero or slightly negative, depending on the length and branching of the carbon chain. Given that CCCCC(C)O is a straight-chain alcohol with a moderate length, its property value is likely to be close to zero, similar to CCC(C)CCO.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCC(C)O would be slightly negative, around -0.1.

From the examples, we can observe that halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values. For instance, ClCCl (dichloromethane) has a property value of 0.79711362, and ClC(Cl)Cl (chloroform) has a property value of 0.58558024. Additionally, CI (iodomethane) has a property value of 0.65137868.

Considering the presence of two bromine atoms, which are heavier and more polarizable than chlorine, we can expect the property value to be positive and potentially higher than those of the chlorinated compounds due to the increased molecular weight and polarizability.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around 0.7 to 0.8. Therefore, a specific predicted property value could be:

Given that the property values seem to correlate with the degree of chlorination and the overall structure, we can infer that the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl will be somewhat lower than 1.47091699 due to having fewer chlorine atoms.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately 1.2.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.12976476772143022
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to be electron-withdrawing.
- An aromatic ring, which is common in many of the examples.
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle, specifically a piperidine-like structure with two chlorine atoms and a ketone group.

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (NO2) or multiple halogens (Cl, F) tend to have negative property values.
- Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups also tend to have negative values.
- The presence of a ketone group in a cyclic structure can influence the property value, but the effect is less clear from the examples.

Considering these factors, the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O has several electron-withdrawing groups (CF3, Cl) and an aromatic ring, which suggests a negative property value. The presence of a ketone group in the cyclic structure might slightly mitigate the negativity, but not significantly.

Based on these observations, I would predict the property value to be around -0.5.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.8784952948336319
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitrobenzene derivative with a methoxy group attached to the benzene ring. 

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have negative property values. For instance, O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.89369585.
- Methoxy groups (OCH3) are electron-donating, which can slightly increase the property value compared to a similar structure without it.

Considering these factors, the presence of both a nitro group and a methoxy group suggests a property value that is likely negative but not as low as a compound with only nitro groups. 

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated polycyclic compound. From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Highly chlorinated compounds tend to have negative property values. For instance, Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of -5.09537436.
2. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally contributes to a more negative property value due to increased electron-withdrawing effects and potential steric hindrance.

Given the structure of the molecule, which is heavily chlorinated and polycyclic, it is reasonable to predict a significantly negative property value. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl would be around -5.5.

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.5385681491759768
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. Esters generally have a range of property values depending on their specific structure and substituents.

Looking at the examples, we can see that simple aliphatic esters and similar compounds tend to have property values around the range of -0.5 to 0.5. For instance, the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 has a property value of -3.04339985, but it is more complex and aromatic. On the other hand, simpler aliphatic compounds like CCC#C have a property value of 0.68835418.

Given that CCCOC=O is a relatively simple aliphatic ester, I would predict its property value to be closer to the lower end of the range for simple aliphatic compounds. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be around 0.1.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.6248339560149843
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a simple ester, specifically decanoate (caprate) ester, with a long alkyl chain and an ester functional group.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with long alkyl chains, such as CCCCC(CC)C=O (-0.83804147) and CCCCC=C(CC)C=O (-0.83461204), tend to have negative property values.
2. Esters, such as CCCOC (0.54553039), tend to have positive property values, but this is a smaller ester compared to the one in question.

Considering the balance between the long hydrophobic alkyl chain and the ester group, the property value is likely to be slightly negative, as the influence of the long alkyl chain might outweigh the ester group's positive contribution.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around -0.5.

True Property: 0.74516725902808
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and functional groups present in the molecule and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have negative property values (-0.6687127).
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, also tend to have negative property values (-0.32325883).
- The presence of chlorine atoms in aromatic rings, as seen in Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, results in a positive property value (0.25978238), but this is countered by the presence of the nitro group.

Considering these factors, the presence of both electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and chloro) and the amide linkage suggests a negative property value. The combination of these features, particularly the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group, is likely to dominate the overall property.

Based on these observations, I predict the property value for Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O to be approximately -0.7.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule contains multiple phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), aromatic rings, and sulfur linkages, which are significant in determining its property value.

From the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and sulfur-containing groups tend to have property values that are positive or slightly negative, depending on the specific arrangement and additional functional groups. For instance, the molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of 1.28369402, which suggests that the presence of phosphorothioate groups and aromatic rings can contribute to a positive property value.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of similar functional groups in the given molecule, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be slightly positive. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately 1.2 for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1.

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.30422982097365264
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

In the examples, we have the following similar structures:

1. Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, with a property value of -0.63484478. This is a nitrotoluene, where a methyl group is attached to the benzene ring along with a nitro group.

2. Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, with a property value of -0.41356646. This is a chlorinated aniline, where an amino group and a chlorine atom are attached to the benzene ring.

3. Clc1ccc(Oc1)N(=O)=O, with a property value of 0.2585225. This is a nitrophenyl ether, where a nitro group and an ether linkage are present.

The presence of the nitro group generally contributes to a more negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature. The hydroxyl group in phenol can also influence the property value, but in this case, the nitro group's effect is likely more dominant.

Considering these factors and the examples, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (4-nitrophenol) is likely to be similar to that of nitrotoluene, but slightly more negative due to the additional electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group on the phenol. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.65.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. This molecule is a complex carbohydrate, likely a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide, characterized by multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages.

From the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, such as sugars and sugar alcohols, tend to have property values around zero or slightly positive. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, which is a sugar alcohol, has a property value of 0.08588001.

Considering the structural similarity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be close to zero, reflecting its polar nature and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O is approximately:

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.6883541753859564

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne. It has a terminal alkyne group (C#C) and a relatively small carbon chain. In the examples, molecules with unsaturated bonds, such as triple bonds, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule N#Cc1ccccc1C#N, which contains two cyano groups (triple bonds), has a property value of -0.41435235.

Considering the small size of the molecule and the presence of a terminal alkyne, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value, but not as negative as larger or more complex unsaturated systems.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around -0.3.

- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 0.85772694.

Considering these structural similarities, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the chlorinated aromatic ring suggests that the property value is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to the examples with similar features.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl would be around 1.0.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is a pyridine derivative with a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a hydrazine moiety (NN). This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2, which has a pyrimidine ring with a carbonyl group and an amine. The property value for this example is -0.77543753.

Considering the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl group and the presence of nitrogen atoms, which can affect the electronic distribution, the property value is likely to be negative. The presence of the hydrazine group (NN) might further influence the property value due to its potential electron-donating effect.

Based on these considerations and the similarity to the example provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be around -0.7. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is:

   - It also contains an amide group (C(=O)N), which is present in several molecules with varying property values, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C (-0.12744474) and CCN2c1cc(N(C)C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23 (1.15156936).
   - The molecule has an alkyl chain (CCC) and a piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1), which are common in many molecules with negative property values, such as C/C1CCC(\C)CC1 (-0.51360713).

2. **Comparison with Similar Molecules:**
   - The presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a potential for a positive property value, as seen in the example with a similar group.
   - The combination of alkyl chains and a piperidine ring, along with the amide group, suggests a tendency towards a negative or slightly positive property value.

3. **Overall Prediction:**
   - Considering the balance of functional groups and structural features, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is slightly positive, but not as high as those with more aromatic or electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be approximately **0.15**.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.793039988202186
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (n-octane), we can analyze the trends in the provided examples. The examples suggest that aliphatic hydrocarbons, particularly linear alkanes, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the property value for CCCCCCCCO (octanol) is -0.41154186, and for CCCC/C=C/C (a linear alkene) is -0.26469446. 

Given that n-octane is a simple linear alkane, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and likely similar to those of other linear hydrocarbons. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (n-octane) would be approximately -0.4.

True Property: 1.053135474951878
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as functional groups, ring structures, and overall molecular complexity. The given molecule, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with a ketone group, an alcohol group, and an alkyne group.

From the examples provided, it seems that molecules with complex polycyclic structures and multiple functional groups tend to have higher property values. For instance, molecules like CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C and CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO have relatively high property values of 1.21143833 and 1.42029077, respectively.

Given the complexity and the presence of both an alcohol and a ketone group, I would predict that the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is likely to be positive and relatively high. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around 1.2.

Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like the one you've provided involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples given. The molecule in question is:

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups. Based on the examples provided, we can make some observations:

1. Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups (like ethers and esters) tend to have positive property values, as seen in examples like the complex polycyclic structures with multiple oxygen atoms.

2. The presence of methoxy groups (OC) and hydroxyl groups (O) in aromatic systems can influence the property value, often contributing to a more positive value due to increased electron density and potential for hydrogen bonding.

3. The complexity and size of the molecule, with multiple fused rings and oxygen atoms, suggest a higher property value, similar to the larger polycyclic structures in the examples.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be positive and relatively high. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately:

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.15656388411901118
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of specific functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to some of the examples provided. For instance, the molecule Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) has a property value of 0.3166468, and Clc1ccccc1I (iodobenzene) has a property value of -1.81240408. The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) in Oc1ccccc1Cl, which is a phenol group, typically contributes to a more negative property value compared to halogenated benzenes without the hydroxyl group.

Considering the examples and the influence of the hydroxyl group, the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is likely to be more negative than that of Fc1ccccc1 but potentially less negative than Clc1ccccc1I due to the smaller size and electronegativity of chlorine compared to iodine.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around -0.5.

- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C)
- An ester linkage (OC(=O))
- An amide group (NC(=O))
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)

From the examples, we observe:
- Molecules with chlorinated aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, such as Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (1.04003716) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (0.85772694).
- Molecules with ester and amide linkages can have varying property values, but the presence of multiple electronegative atoms and polar groups often leads to more positive values.

Considering these factors, the presence of both the chloroalkyne and the chlorinated aromatic ring, along with the polar ester and amide groups, suggests a property value that is likely positive but not extremely high.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around 0.8.

- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2) attached to the central carbon.
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have negative property values, such as Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (-0.47685279) and Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.80721655).
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like chlorine tends to decrease the property value.
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings like pyrimidine (c2cncnc2) also tend to have negative property values, as seen in Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2 (-0.51325004).

Considering these observations, the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl has multiple aromatic rings, chlorine substituents, and a heterocyclic pyrimidine ring, all of which suggest a negative property value.

Based on these structural features and the trends from the examples, I would predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately -0.7.

The structure of CCCCCOC=O is similar in that it contains a linear alkyl chain and an ester functional group. The presence of the ester group and the linear alkyl chain suggests that the property value should be close to that of similar esters.

Considering the examples and the structural similarity, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be slightly negative, similar to the example CCCCC(=O)OCC. Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCCCOC=O could be approximately -0.03.

To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methylphenol, specifically p-cresol, which consists of a benzene ring with a methyl group and a hydroxyl group attached.

From the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with phenol groups (aromatic rings with hydroxyl groups) tend to have negative property values. For instance, Oc1cccc(O)c1 has a property value of 0.1004389, and Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.30422982.
- The presence of additional electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro groups) tends to decrease the property value further, as seen in Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O.

Given that Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a simple phenol derivative without additional electron-withdrawing groups, its property value is likely to be slightly negative, similar to other phenol derivatives without strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be around -0.25.

3. Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of -5.09537436.

The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a biphenyl with four chlorine atoms, similar to the second example, which has a high property value. The first example also has multiple chlorines and a high property value. The third example, however, has a significantly lower property value, likely due to the presence of an oxygen atom and a different structure.

Given the structural similarity to the second example, we can predict that the property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl will be closer to the higher end of the range observed for chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is approximately 0.85.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple hydrocarbon with a double bond and a branched methyl group.

From the examples, we observe that:

1. Simple hydrocarbons with linear or branched chains, such as CCCCCCCC (octane) and CCCCCCCC=C (nonene), tend to have negative property values, with more negative values for longer chains or more unsaturation.
2. The presence of functional groups like carbonyls, nitro groups, or aromatic rings tends to increase the property value, often making it less negative or even positive.

Given that CC=C(C)C is a small, unsaturated hydrocarbon without any additional functional groups, it is likely to have a negative property value, similar to other small hydrocarbons.

Considering the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around -1.0, as it is a small, unsaturated hydrocarbon similar to other small alkenes or alkanes in the dataset.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.7971136249026308
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall complexity of the molecule.

The molecule ClCCl is a simple dihalomethane, specifically dichloromethane. In the examples, simpler molecules with fewer functional groups and less complexity tend to have property values closer to zero, often slightly positive or negative depending on the specific functional groups present.

For instance, the molecule ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of 0.05311701, and it is a more complex chlorinated compound compared to ClCCl. Given the simplicity of ClCCl and the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl is approximately -0.1.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 2.1484275937375066
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as aromatic rings. The presence of methoxy groups (OC) and hydroxyl groups (O) suggests some degree of polarity, which could influence the property value.

From the examples provided, molecules with complex polycyclic structures and multiple functional groups tend to have property values that are positive and relatively high. For instance, molecules like O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (1.522734) and CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO (1.29232875) have high property values.

Considering the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups in the given molecule, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. Based on the pattern observed in the examples, a predicted property value for the molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 could be around 1.0.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.9423928307883442
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A thioether group (CS-)
- A pyrazole ring (1,2,4-triazole-like structure)
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- A tertiary butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of halogens (Cl, Br) and nitro groups (N(=O)=O) often results in negative property values.
- Molecules with alkyl chains or ether groups tend to have positive property values.

The molecule in question has a combination of a heterocyclic ring with a carbonyl group and a bulky alkyl group, which might balance the property value towards a slightly negative or neutral value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be around -0.1.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -1.3645695996974423
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is an ethyl benzoate, which is an ester derived from benzoic acid and ethanol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Aromatic compounds with a benzene ring, such as "c1ccc2cnccc2c1" and "Clc1cccc2ccccc12", tend to have negative property values.
2. Esters, such as "CCCCCC(=O)OC" and "CCCCC(=O)OCC", have property values around -0.44427584.
3. The presence of an ester group (COC(=O)) in the molecule "CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2" is associated with a positive property value, but this molecule also contains additional functional groups that contribute to the overall property.

Considering these observations, the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ester with a benzene ring. The ester group might slightly increase the property value compared to a simple aromatic compound, but the aromatic nature of the benzene ring will likely dominate, leading to a negative property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is around -0.44427584, similar to other esters with aromatic components.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -1.3980793073315951
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the trends and characteristics of the given examples. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, aromatic rings, and halogens.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached. In the examples, linear alkyl chains like CCCCCCC=C have a property value of -0.78011019, and the presence of a halogen like bromine in Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of -2.22700695. However, the latter is an aromatic compound, which significantly affects its property value.

Considering the linear nature of CCCCCCCBr and the presence of a bromine atom, we can expect the property value to be slightly more negative than a simple alkane but not as negative as an aromatic compound with bromine. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around -0.8 to -1.0.

Given these considerations, a specific predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr could be approximately -0.9.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.103138554570512
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for carbon monoxide (CO) based on the given examples is challenging due to the lack of direct correlation between the molecular structure of CO and the examples provided. However, we can make an educated guess by considering the nature of CO as a small, simple diatomic molecule.

The examples provided include a range of organic molecules with varying complexity and functional groups, and their property values range from negative to positive. CO is a small, non-polar molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen, which might suggest a property value closer to zero, as seen with other small or simple molecules in the examples.

Given this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO could be around 0.0. However, without a clear pattern or specific property definition, this remains a speculative estimate.
