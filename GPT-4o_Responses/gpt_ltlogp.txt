SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 657.5908591326393
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the trends and patterns from the given examples. The molecule in question is a linear ester with a long carbon chain, similar to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Linear alkanes and their derivatives tend to have positive property values. For instance, CCCCCCC(C)O has a property value of 265.95106331, and CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is similar in structure but with an additional carbon in the chain.

2. The property values for esters and similar compounds tend to be positive and increase with the length of the carbon chain. For example, CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of 1191.40876392.

Given these observations, we can predict that the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC will be slightly higher than that of CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC due to the additional carbon in the chain.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is approximately 1411.40876392.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -386.2345645410203
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a lactam (cyclic amide) structure.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values, often in the range of hundreds to over a thousand.
- Compounds with carbonyl groups (C=O) and nitrogen heterocycles can have negative property values, especially if they are small or have multiple carbonyl groups.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 has a single carbonyl group and a nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring, which might suggest a negative property value. However, the presence of chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring could increase the property value.

Balancing these factors, the property value is likely to be slightly negative or close to zero, given the influence of the carbonyl and nitrogen heterocycle, but not as negative as molecules with multiple carbonyl groups or larger heterocycles.

Considering these aspects, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around -200.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -1140.9143248399482
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite, which contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O).

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, tend to have negative property values. The presence of the nitro group, which is electron-withdrawing, likely contributes to this trend. Additionally, smaller and simpler molecules tend to have less extreme property values compared to larger, more complex structures.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative, reflecting the influence of the nitro group. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O would be around -1000.

True Property: 224.21446731637334
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure without computational tools is a complex task, as it involves understanding the relationship between molecular structure and the property in question. The examples provided suggest that the property values are likely related to some form of molecular descriptor or calculated property, such as a thermodynamic or electronic property.

The molecule in question, CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, appears to be a polycyclic compound with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and alcohols. Based on the examples, larger and more complex molecules with multiple rings and halogen substitutions tend to have higher property values, while smaller or simpler molecules tend to have lower or negative values.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple rings and functional groups, I would predict a relatively high property value for this molecule. However, without specific information on the nature of the property being measured, this prediction is speculative.

A reasonable estimate, considering the complexity and the presence of functional groups, might be around 1500 to 2000. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately:

True Property: 849.168676796918
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a fluorinated aromatic compound with an amide linkage and a chlorinated aromatic ring. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Fluorinated Aromatic Ring (Fc1cccc(F)c1):** 
   - Similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of 250.69325854.

2. **Amide Linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N):**
   - Amide linkages are present in several examples, such as CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O with a property value of -1323.39219617. However, the presence of two carbonyl groups and nitrogen atoms can significantly affect the property.

3. **Chlorinated Aromatic Ring (c2ccc(Cl)cc2):**
   - Similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 447.74472814.

Considering these components, the molecule combines features from both fluorinated and chlorinated aromatic systems, along with the influence of the amide linkage. The presence of both electron-withdrawing groups (F and Cl) and the amide linkage suggests a property value that is likely influenced by these factors.

Given the examples, the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 is likely to be in the range of the examples with similar functional groups. Taking into account the electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents and the amide linkage, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 200 to 300.

Therefore, a predicted property value for this molecule could be approximately:

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -354.1452800822533
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the types of atoms involved.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a relatively simple structure with an ether functional group (COC) and a total of six carbon atoms. Comparing it to similar structures in the examples:

- CCCCCCO (hexanol) has a property value of -800.59001589.
- CCCCCC1CCCC1 (cyclohexane derivative) has a property value of 970.13638452.
- CCC(C)CO (butanol derivative) has a property value of -632.27521894.

Given that CCCOC(C)C is an ether and is similar in size to these examples, we can infer that its property value will likely be negative, as ethers and alcohols in the examples tend to have negative values. Considering the size and functional group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C would be around -700.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is approximately -700.

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: -520.3253527761822
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of halogens, especially bromine, tends to increase the property value. Additionally, carbonyl groups can have varying effects depending on their context within the molecule. The presence of alkyl groups, such as the propyl group in this molecule, generally contributes to a moderate increase in the property value.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (46.86814468) and other halogenated compounds, we can estimate the property value for CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O to be around 50.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some form of energy or stability measure.

Biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic compound consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples, we have:

- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, with a property value of 1342.70050336.
- Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34, another polycyclic aromatic compound, with a property value of 1634.84299117.
- c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67, a highly conjugated polycyclic aromatic compound, with a property value of 3133.80257309.

These examples suggest that the property value increases with the complexity and conjugation of the aromatic system. Biphenyl, being simpler than the examples provided, should have a lower property value than these polycyclic compounds.

Considering the structure of biphenyl and its relative simplicity compared to the examples, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be around 1000. This is a rough estimate based on the trend observed in the examples, where simpler aromatic systems have lower property values compared to more complex and highly conjugated systems.

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -426.05538235552393
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the presence of heteroatoms like sulfur, oxygen, nitrogen, and halogens.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear alkane chain with a terminal sulfur atom. In the examples, linear alkanes like CCCCCCC=C (816.87413039) and CCC1CCCCC1 (436.31847973) have positive property values. The presence of sulfur, as seen in molecules like COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O (-1017.62031504) and CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (2108.24546275), can significantly affect the property value, often increasing it due to the polarizability and size of the sulfur atom.

Considering these factors, the presence of sulfur in CCCCCS is likely to increase the property value compared to a similar alkane without sulfur. However, since CCCCCS is a relatively small molecule compared to some of the larger examples with sulfur, the increase might not be as pronounced as in larger sulfur-containing compounds.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be slightly higher than that of a similar alkane without sulfur, but not as high as the larger sulfur-containing examples. Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCCCS could be around 500.

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -365.36626654544676
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the degree of branching.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol, specifically 2-methyl-2-pentanol. In the examples, we have a few similar structures:

1. CCC(C)(C)C (2,2-dimethylbutane) with a property value of 70.81537189.
2. CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O (a cyclic alcohol) with a property value of 68.76275241.
3. CC(C)CC(C)O (a linear alcohol) with a property value of -633.36994933.

The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) in alcohols generally leads to a more negative property value compared to alkanes due to the polar nature of the OH group. The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is more similar to the linear alcohol CC(C)CC(C)O, which has a property value of -633.36994933.

Considering the structural similarity and the influence of the hydroxyl group, the predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is likely to be in the same range as the linear alcohol. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO is approximately -633.36994933.

True Property: 553.6735771796003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is a naphthalene derivative with a methyl group attached, also known as 2-methylnaphthalene.

From the examples, we can see that similar aromatic compounds with additional rings or substituents tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (1-methyl-2-phenylbenzene) has a property value of 764.69654334, and Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1 (1,2,3-trimethylbenzene) has a property value of 186.69258331.

Given that Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is structurally similar to these examples, particularly to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, we can infer that its property value will be in a similar range. However, since it is a simpler structure compared to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, we can expect a slightly lower value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 would be around 700.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic urea with additional alkyl and alkenyl substituents. The examples provided show a range of property values for different types of molecules, including cyclic structures, aromatic compounds, and those with various functional groups.

The closest example in terms of structure is O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -1644.96924724. The molecule we are predicting has a similar core structure but with additional alkyl groups, which could slightly alter the property value.

Considering the structural similarity and the potential impact of the additional alkyl groups, the predicted property value for O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is likely to be close to -1644.96924724, but slightly less negative due to the increased hydrophobic character from the alkyl chain.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately -1600.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Aromatic rings (benzene rings) tend to have positive property values, as seen in molecules like c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 (2258.83931156) and c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 (1920.70446338).

2. The presence of halogens, particularly fluorine, can significantly influence the property value. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of 414.35545135, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a much higher value of 3376.55903633 due to multiple halogen substitutions.

3. The trifluoromethyl group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which can increase the property value compared to a simple benzene ring.

Considering these points, the presence of the trifluoromethyl group on the benzene ring is likely to result in a positive property value, potentially higher than a simple halogenated benzene but lower than highly halogenated compounds.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around 500.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have very negative property values, indicating a strong influence of the hydroxyl groups on the property. The example OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO has a property value of -4053.51293918.

Given that OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is structurally similar to OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, with a similar number of hydroxyl groups and overall structure, we can predict that its property value will also be very negative and in a similar range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately -4050.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. It resembles some of the more complex cyclic structures in the examples, such as CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of 1711.26885629.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of multiple rings and carbonyl groups, the property value for the molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C is likely to be in a similar range. However, the presence of additional oxygen atoms and the specific arrangement of the rings may slightly alter the value.

From the examples, we can observe that polycyclic structures with ketone groups, such as CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O, have relatively high property values (869.0790857 in this case). The presence of multiple rings and a ketone group in the target molecule suggests it might have a similar property value.

Considering the complexity and the structural similarities to the example with a property value of 869.0790857, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O would be in a similar range. Therefore, I would predict a property value around 850 to 900.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is an acetanilide derivative with a nitro group attached to the aromatic ring.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of nitro groups (N(=O)=O) generally contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in molecules like O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (-509.18647109) and COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (-503.30229526). The acetanilide structure (CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1) itself is not directly present in the examples, but we can infer its contribution by considering similar structures.

Given the presence of both an acetamide group and a nitro group, the property value is likely to be negative and somewhat similar to the examples with nitro groups on aromatic rings. Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O would be around -500.0.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
- Two ethoxy groups (OCC)
- A thioether linkage (SC)
- A chloro-substituted aromatic ring
- A lactone-like structure with a nitrogen atom in the ring

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with halogenated aromatic rings, such as Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, tend to have higher property values.
- Molecules with heteroatoms like nitrogen and oxygen in rings, such as CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, also have relatively high property values.
- The presence of sulfur, as in CSSC, tends to lower the property value.

Considering these factors, the presence of a phosphorothioate group and a chloro-substituted aromatic ring suggests a moderately high property value, but the presence of sulfur might slightly lower it compared to similar structures without sulfur.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be around 500.

From the examples, we can observe that small alcohols and similar small organic molecules tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCC (propane) has a property value of -631.31732985, and CC(C)CO (isobutanol) has a property value of -1166.09312373. Given that tert-butanol is similar in size and structure to isobutanol, we can expect a similar property value.

This trend suggests that the presence of nitrogen atoms in the heterocyclic structure contributes to a lower property value.

Given that O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is a purine derivative with a similar nitrogen-rich heterocyclic structure, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and likely in the range of the other nitrogen-containing heterocycles.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 would be approximately -1500.0.

From the examples, we can observe that smaller, simpler molecules with fewer rings and functional groups tend to have more negative property values, while larger, more complex molecules with multiple rings and functional groups tend to have higher positive values.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is relatively simple, similar to other small molecules like CC(C)O (-1335.50265107) and CCC(C)(C)C (70.81537189). Given that CC(C)OC=O is an ester, it might have a property value that is less negative than CC(C)O due to the presence of the ester group, which can contribute to a slightly higher value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around -1200.

The molecule in question is a urea derivative with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. This structure is similar to other aromatic compounds with amide or urea linkages.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with amide or urea linkages tend to have negative property values. For instance, NC(=O)c1cccnc1 has a property value of -1476.85971224, and CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O has a property value of -1257.57153167. These examples suggest that the presence of the amide or urea linkage contributes significantly to the negative property value.

Considering the structure of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, which is a symmetrical urea derivative with two phenyl groups, we can expect a similar trend. The presence of two phenyl groups and the urea linkage will likely result in a negative property value, similar to the examples provided.

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value for O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 to be approximately -1300.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13, which is triphenylene, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some calculated property like molecular weight, logP, or another physicochemical property.

Triphenylene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a structure that is more complex than simple benzene rings but less complex than some of the larger, more substituted aromatic systems in the examples. It is similar in complexity to the example c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1, which is a larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a property value of 1920.70446338.

Given that triphenylene is smaller and less complex than the example with a property value of 1920.70446338, but more complex than simple aromatic compounds like benzene derivatives, we can estimate its property value to be somewhat lower than 1920.70446338 but higher than simpler aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of triphenylene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13) would be around 1500.

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -1983.124621616702
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a sulfonamide derivative with an aromatic ring, which is similar to some of the examples given.

The examples show a range of property values, with aromatic compounds and those containing sulfonamide or similar functional groups generally having negative property values. For instance, the molecule O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O has a property value of -1202.90343298, and it contains a nitro group and a heterocyclic ring, which are somewhat similar in complexity to the sulfonamide and aromatic amine groups in the target molecule.

Considering the presence of the sulfonamide group, the aromatic ring, and the amine groups, the property value is likely to be negative and possibly in the range of other aromatic sulfonamide compounds. Based on the examples and the structural features, a reasonable prediction for the property value of NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 would be approximately -1000.

True Property: 1084.604130576485
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with negative property values.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which can also contribute to a negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
- An alkene group (CC(C)=C), which is less common in the examples but can influence the property value.

Based on the examples, molecules with nitro groups and electron-withdrawing groups like trifluoromethyl tend to have negative property values. For instance, Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -710.61686224, and Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl has a property value of -595.87543359.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be negative and in a similar range to those examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O would be approximately -650.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -1211.8665380248972
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including functional groups, chain length, and presence of heteroatoms or aromatic rings.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl acetate, an ester. In the examples, esters and similar functional groups tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCC(C)C1(CC=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O has a property value of -942.8365455, and CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 has a property value of -611.3385003. These examples suggest that the presence of an ester group contributes to a negative property value.

Considering the relatively simple structure of isopropyl acetate compared to the more complex structures in the examples, we can predict a moderately negative property value. Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around -500.0.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -225.76077398752025
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the simpler aromatic compounds in the examples.

Looking at the examples, we have:
- c1ccccc1O (phenol) with a property value of -647.8067063
- Cc1cccc(C)c1 (dimethylbenzene) with a property value of 149.44438191

The target molecule, Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, is a combination of these two structures, being a methylphenol. The presence of the hydroxyl group (O) typically contributes a negative value, as seen in phenol, while the methyl groups contribute a positive value, as seen in dimethylbenzene.

Considering these factors, the property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is likely to be between the values for phenol and dimethylbenzene. Given the influence of the hydroxyl group, the value should be closer to that of phenol but slightly higher due to the additional methyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is approximately -300.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the functional group in several of the examples. Additionally, it has a methoxy group (OC) and a substituted aromatic ring, which are also present in some of the examples.

Let's consider the examples with similar functional groups:

1. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl: 1582.56961521
2. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl: 1474.53341017
3. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl: 1507.92268697

These examples have a phosphorothioate group and a substituted aromatic ring with halogens. The property values for these examples are in the range of 1474 to 1582.

The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) on the aromatic ring, which are less electron-withdrawing compared to halogens. This could result in a lower property value compared to the examples with halogens.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 would be slightly lower than the lowest value in the examples with halogens. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 1400.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound with multiple chlorine atoms attached to two fused benzene rings. This structure is similar to the example Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 3376.55903633. The molecule we are predicting for has fewer chlorine atoms and a slightly simpler structure.

Given the trend that more chlorine atoms and more complex aromatic systems tend to have higher property values, we can estimate that the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl will be somewhat lower than 3376.55903633 but still relatively high due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and the fused ring system.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 3000.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -1139.8195944532952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple nitroalkane, specifically nitropropane.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of nitro groups (N(=O)=O) generally contributes to a negative property value. For instance, the molecule O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O has a property value of -634.80678296, and CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a property value of 1237.86638471, which is positive but includes additional complex structures and functional groups.

Given that CCCN(=O)=O is a relatively simple molecule with a single nitro group, we can expect its property value to be negative, similar to other simple nitro compounds. Considering the trend and the simplicity of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around -500.0.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 170.50425772120846
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, which is similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's consider the examples with similar structures:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of 522.39165638.
- COc1ccccc1Cl has a property value of 6.56838232.
- COc1cccc(Cl)c1 has a property value of 6.56838232.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but with a fluorine atom instead of a chlorine atom. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which could affect the property value. However, the presence of bromine, which is a heavier halogen, might have a more significant impact on the property value.

Considering these factors, the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is likely to be closer to the value for Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but slightly adjusted due to the presence of fluorine. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be slightly lower than 522.39165638, but still in a similar range.

A predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 could be approximately 500.0.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -99.55204453625944
Predicted Property:
Predicting the specific property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 based on the given examples is challenging without a clear understanding of what the property represents. However, I can attempt to make an educated guess by comparing the structure of the given molecule to those in the examples.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles some of the cyclic and bicyclic structures in the examples, such as CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO, which has a property value of -303.30873775, and CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O, which has a property value of 205.94615399.

Given the presence of the alcohol group and the bicyclic structure, the property value might be influenced by the steric and electronic effects of these features. The examples with similar structural complexity and functional groups have property values ranging from negative to positive, but the presence of the alcohol group might suggest a more negative value due to potential hydrogen bonding or polarity effects.

Considering these factors, I would predict a property value in the negative range, possibly around -500 to -300. However, without a clear definition of the property, this is a speculative estimate. For a more accurate prediction, additional context or a defined property would be necessary.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 164.9621851387777
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 1053.13063196. The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of the SC(CCl) group in the example, which is replaced by a simpler structure in the molecule we are predicting.

Given that the SC(CCl) group is likely contributing significantly to the property value due to its complexity and the presence of chlorine, removing it would likely decrease the property value. However, the core structure of the molecule, which includes the phosphorothioate group and the benzene ring, remains the same.

Considering these factors, I would predict a property value slightly lower than 1053.13063196 due to the absence of the SC(CCl) group. A reasonable estimate might be around 950.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. This molecule is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, specifically a methylated benzotriazole.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings and heterocycles tend to have positive property values, often in the range of several hundred. For instance, the molecule Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O has a property value of 453.99837547, and it contains a similar aromatic and heterocyclic structure.

Given the structural similarity and the presence of aromatic and heterocyclic features, I would predict that the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is likely to be positive and in the range of a few hundred. A reasonable estimate, considering the examples, would be around 400.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly indicating a thermodynamic property such as enthalpy or Gibbs free energy.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is an ester, specifically ethyl heptanoate. It has a linear alkyl chain with seven carbon atoms and an ester functional group. We can compare it to similar structures in the examples:

1. CCCCCCC(=O)OC (octyl acetate) has a property value of 390.68190674.
2. CCCCCCCCI (iodoheptane) has a property value of 720.33259442.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar to CCCCCCC(=O)OC, but with an additional ethyl group instead of a methyl group. This suggests that the property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC should be slightly higher than that of CCCCCCC(=O)OC due to the increased molecular size and mass.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be slightly higher than 390.68190674. A plausible estimate could be around 450.0, considering the trend in the examples provided.

From the examples, we have:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 with a property value of -526.90741923
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 with a property value of -325.47702808

The structure COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is very similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, differing only by the presence of an additional methyl group in the latter. The property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is -325.47702808. Removing a methyl group typically results in a decrease in the property value due to the reduction in molecular size and mass.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be slightly lower than -325.47702808. A reasonable estimate would be around -350.0, considering the trend observed in the examples.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we need to consider the patterns and trends from the given examples. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the overall complexity of the molecule.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, also known as 1,3-butadiene. It is a relatively simple molecule compared to many of the examples provided, which include more complex structures and functional groups.

From the examples, simpler hydrocarbons and those with fewer functional groups tend to have lower property values, often negative. For instance, the molecule CC/C=C/C (a simple alkene) has a property value of -250.76167919, and C=Cc1ccccc1 (styrene) has a property value of -6.43154102.

Given the simplicity and unsaturation of C=CCC=C, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is negative and likely closer to the simpler alkenes. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C would be around -200.0.

True Property: 79.1626910848464
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br, also known as bromoform, is a simple halogenated compound with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples provided, molecules with multiple halogen atoms, such as Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, tend to have relatively high property values. This is likely due to the high atomic mass and polarizability of halogens, especially bromine.

Given the simplicity of BrC(Br)Br compared to more complex aromatic or polycyclic structures, we can expect its property value to be lower than those of larger, more complex halogenated compounds. However, due to the presence of three bromine atoms, the property value should still be significant.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around 1500.

- A thioester linkage (SC).
- A chloro-substituted carbon (CCl).
- An imide group (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O), which is a cyclic structure with a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with halogen substitutions, especially multiple chlorines, tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of aromatic rings, especially when combined with other functional groups, can also increase the property value.
- The presence of sulfur, as in phosphorothioates, can contribute to a higher property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule has several features that suggest a relatively high property value, similar to other complex molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substitutions.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 1500.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A dimethylamino group (CN(C)C(=O)), which is similar to the CN(C)C(=O) group in CN(C)C(=O)C and CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, both of which have negative property values.
- A chloro-substituted aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O and Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which have negative and positive property values, respectively.
- A heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen atoms, similar to Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2 and CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O, both of which have negative property values.
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C), which is present in CCC(C)C and CCC(C)C, both of which have negative property values.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value. The presence of multiple electronegative atoms and functional groups that typically contribute to negative values suggests a more negative property value.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be approximately -1200.0.

The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall complexity of the molecule.

The molecule in question, Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether. It contains two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with three chlorine atoms and two hydroxyl groups.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values. For instance, Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 1140.4353803.
- Molecules with ether linkages and aromatic rings also tend to have higher property values. For example, Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 has a property value of 1588.31694974.

Considering these observations, the presence of three chlorine atoms, two aromatic rings, and an ether linkage in the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl suggests that it will have a relatively high property value.

Based on these considerations, I predict the property value for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl to be approximately 1500.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC/C=C\C, we can look at the example provided for a similar molecule, CC/C=C/C, which has a property value of -250.76167919. The molecule CC/C=C\C is a geometric isomer of CC/C=C/C, differing only in the configuration around the double bond (cis vs. trans). Typically, such isomers have very similar properties, with slight differences due to the spatial arrangement of atoms.

Given this, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C would be very close to that of CC/C=C/C. Therefore, I would predict the property value for CC/C=C\C to be approximately -250.76167919, with a small possible variation due to the isomeric difference.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCOCC is a simple linear ether, specifically diethyl ether. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify a few trends:
- Simple alkanes and ethers tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of functional groups like carbonyls, halogens, or aromatic rings tends to increase the property value.
- The complexity and size of the molecule also seem to influence the property value.

Given that CCCOCC is a relatively simple molecule without any complex functional groups or aromatic rings, we can expect its property value to be negative, similar to other simple alkanes and ethers.

Based on these observations and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be around -500. This is consistent with the trend seen in other simple molecules like CC(C)Cl (-482.63925922) and CCC(O)CC (-801.68474628). Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOCC is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a tertiary amide with two phenyl groups and a tertiary butyl group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 683.59070582. Both molecules contain a tertiary amide linkage and two phenyl rings, although the example has an additional heterocyclic component.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of the tertiary amide and phenyl groups, we can expect the property value to be in a similar range. However, the absence of the heterocyclic component in the molecule to be predicted might slightly lower the property value compared to the example.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be approximately 650.

2. Fc1cccc(Br)c1 has a property value of 170.50425772.
3. Cc1ccc(O)cc1C has a property value of -225.76077399.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is similar to Oc1ccc(Br)cc1, but with an acetamide group instead of a hydroxyl group. The presence of the acetamide group might increase the property value compared to the hydroxyl group due to additional interactions or stability provided by the amide linkage.

Considering these factors, the property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to be slightly higher than that of Oc1ccc(Br)cc1. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around -100.0.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with benzene rings, such as Cc1ccccc1N (-521.21482122) and CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (149.44438191), have varying property values depending on the substituents attached to the benzene ring.
- The presence of alkyl groups, such as in CC(C)CO (-1166.09312373) and CC(C)CCCO (-632.27521894), also influences the property value.

Considering the structure of isobutylbenzene, it is similar to CCc1ccc(C)cc1, which has a property value of 149.44438191. The additional methyl group in isobutylbenzene (compared to propylbenzene) might slightly increase the property value due to increased molecular size and potential interactions.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 would be slightly higher than 149.44438191. A predicted value could be around 200.0, considering the influence of the additional methyl group.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -574.6650323436718
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with functional groups such as carbonyls (C=O) tend to have negative property values. For instance, NC(=O)c1ccccc1O has a property value of -1264.34517594, and O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -571.99662703. These examples suggest that the presence of a carbonyl group in an aromatic compound contributes to a negative property value.

Considering the structure of benzaldehyde and the trends observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for O=Cc1ccccc1 will also be negative. Given the simplicity of benzaldehyde compared to the other examples with more complex substituents, the property value is likely to be less negative than those with additional functional groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) is approximately -500.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -1550.0698068515158
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. This molecule contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, similar to the first example, Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2, which has a property value of 1611.23786721. Additionally, the molecule has a lactam structure (a cyclic amide), which is a feature seen in some of the other examples with varying property values.

Considering the presence of the nitro group, which tends to increase the property value, and the cyclic amide, which can have a stabilizing effect, the property value is likely to be positive and relatively high. However, the absence of halogens, which often contribute significantly to higher property values, suggests it might not be as high as the first example.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be around 1200.

True Property: 538.1968263382932
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a diaryl hydrazine, which is structurally similar to the example N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 1206.25604479.

The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of a double bond in the example molecule (N=) compared to a single bond in the target molecule (N-N). This change could affect the electronic properties and stability of the molecule, potentially leading to a different property value.

Considering the structural similarity and the potential impact of the bond difference, the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be close to, but slightly different from, 1206.25604479. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the target molecule would be around 1200.0.

True Property: -1660.021790060979
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a relatively small and compact structure with two amide groups and a cyclohexane ring. In the examples, similar cyclic structures with amide groups, such as O=C1N(COC(=O)CC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3, have a property value of 36.7418886, and O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC has a property value of -789.57429137.

Considering the structural similarity to these examples, particularly the presence of amide groups and a cyclic structure, the property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be in a similar range. Given the compactness and lack of additional large substituents, the property value is expected to be closer to the lower end of the range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately -800.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, which is a chlorinated aromatic compound.

From the examples, we can observe that chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values. For instance, Clc1ccccc1Cl (dichlorobenzene) has a property value of 447.74472814, and Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (a more heavily chlorinated compound) has a much higher property value of 2843.90428258.

Given that 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene is more chlorinated than dichlorobenzene but less complex than the heavily chlorinated compound, we can expect its property value to be higher than 447.74472814 but significantly lower than 2843.90428258.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 800 to 1000. A specific prediction could be approximately 900.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 323.21914665930547
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically 1,3-diethylbenzene.

Looking at the examples, we can see that aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions tend to have property values that are not extremely high or low. For instance, the molecule Cc1ccccc1N has a property value of -521.21482122, and Cc1ccccc1N is an aniline, which is a benzene ring with an amino group. The molecule Cc1cc(=O)[nH]c(=S)[nH]1, which is a thioamide, has a property value of -1093.42355225, indicating that the presence of additional functional groups like carbonyls or heteroatoms can significantly affect the property value.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a relatively simple aromatic hydrocarbon without additional functional groups that would drastically alter its property value, we can expect its property value to be closer to that of simple hydrocarbons or alkyl-substituted aromatics. The molecule CCCCCCCc1ccccc1, which is a long-chain alkyl benzene, has a property value of 1006.05722533, but it is significantly larger than CCc1ccc(CC)cc1.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is likely to be moderate and not as extreme as those with more complex functional groups. A reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, based on the examples and its structural simplicity, would be around -400 to -500. Therefore, a specific predicted property value could be approximately:

True Property: -1657.695487989341
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is a sulfonamide derivative, which is similar in some respects to the nitrobenzene derivatives in the examples. The presence of the sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is somewhat analogous to the nitro group (N(=O)=O) in terms of electron-withdrawing effects and molecular weight contribution.

Looking at the examples, the nitrobenzene derivative Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -795.04794331. The sulfonamide group is slightly heavier and more polar than the nitro group, which might suggest a slightly more negative property value due to increased molecular interactions or solvation effects.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be slightly more negative than -795.04794331. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -850.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, we need to consider the structural similarities and patterns from the given examples. The molecule in question is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically triphenylene, which is similar in structure to other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the examples.

Looking at the examples, we have:
- c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 with a property value of 2131.72742954
- c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 with a property value of 2258.83931156

Both of these examples are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with multiple fused benzene rings. The molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 is also a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a similar number of rings and complexity.

Given the structural similarity and the property values of the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 would be around the average of the two similar examples. Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately:

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. The molecule appears to be a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups, similar to some of the examples given.

The examples with similar structural features, such as multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups, tend to have relatively high property values. For instance, the molecule Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 has a property value of 835.48454696, and it shares some structural similarities with the target molecule, such as the presence of aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 is likely to be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 850.0.

True Property: -751.9429343322957
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in the example molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a property value of 1507.92268697. However, the example molecule is more complex and contains additional aromatic rings and chlorine atoms, which likely contribute significantly to its high property value.

The target molecule is simpler, with a phosphorothioate group, an acetyl group (C(C)=O), and a thiol group (SC). The presence of these functional groups suggests that the property value will be lower than the example with the aromatic rings and multiple chlorine atoms.

Considering the complexity and the types of atoms and functional groups present, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be significantly lower than 1507.92268697 but still positive due to the presence of the phosphorothioate group. A rough estimate might place it around 500, considering the simpler structure compared to the example with a high property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is approximately 500.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -276.2825813315571
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, simple molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with halogen atoms, particularly chlorine, tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a very high property value of 3376.55903633, likely due to the multiple chlorine atoms. However, this molecule is much larger and more complex than Cl\C=C/Cl.

On the other hand, smaller molecules with fewer chlorine atoms, such as Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, have a property value of 246.314337. Given that Cl\C=C/Cl is even smaller and simpler, we can expect its property value to be lower than this.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around 100. This value reflects the presence of chlorine atoms, which tend to increase the property value, but also accounts for the simplicity and small size of the molecule compared to the examples provided.

Pyridine, c1ccncc1, is an aromatic heterocycle similar to benzene but with one nitrogen atom replacing a CH group. In the examples, aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 (quinoline), have a property value of 303.7876823. Pyridine is simpler than quinoline, which suggests its property value might be lower.

Considering the examples and the nature of pyridine, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccncc1 would be around 100.0. This is a rough estimate based on the trend observed in the examples provided.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has several key features:
- An ester linkage (COC(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)
- An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring
- A pyridine-like structure (ccnc)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens (like Cl) tend to have positive property values (e.g., Clc1ccc(I)cc1, 414.35545135).
- Molecules with ester and amide linkages can have both positive and negative values, but the presence of aromatic rings and halogens often shifts the value towards the positive side.
- Complex aromatic systems with multiple rings and heteroatoms (like nitrogen in pyridine) also tend to have positive values (e.g., c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3, 717.73260975).

Considering these observations, the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 is likely to have a positive property value due to its complex aromatic structure, presence of a chlorine atom, and the combination of ester and amide linkages.

Based on the trends from the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 800.

The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the types of atoms involved.

The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol with five carbon atoms and one hydroxyl group (an alcohol group). In the examples, linear alkanes and alcohols tend to have moderate property values. For instance, the molecule CCCCC(=O)CCCC has a property value of 408.40285487, and the molecule OC1CCCCCCC1 has a property value of -169.27268604.

Considering the structure of CCCCCO, which is a primary alcohol with a relatively simple structure, we can predict that its property value will be similar to other linear alcohols or alkanes with a similar number of carbon atoms. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be around 200 to 300.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCO is approximately 250.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a sulfonamide with a cyclic structure, containing a benzene ring, a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), and an amide linkage (C(=O)N). These features are somewhat similar to the structures in the examples, particularly those with aromatic rings and functional groups like sulfonyl or carbonyl groups.

From the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and additional functional groups like sulfonyl or carbonyl tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C has a property value of 1060.93058597, and it contains aromatic rings and a phosphonothioate group. Another example, Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, has a property value of 2482.43799303, with multiple aromatic rings and chlorine substituents.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of the sulfonyl and amide groups in the target molecule, it is likely to have a moderately high property value, but not as high as those with multiple halogen substitutions or extensive aromatic systems.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be around 800 to 1200. Given the specific structural features, a more precise estimate would be approximately 950.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a bicyclic compound with two amide groups and a cyclopropane ring.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) and nitrogen atoms (N) in amide linkages generally contributes to a more negative property value. Additionally, the presence of small rings like cyclopropane can also influence the property value.

Given these considerations, the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is expected to have a property value that is negative, but not as extreme as some of the more complex or highly functionalized molecules in the examples. It is likely to be more negative than simple hydrocarbons or molecules with fewer polar functional groups.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure, consisting of a chloroethane (ethyl chloride) group. In the examples, simpler and smaller molecules tend to have lower property values, often negative, while larger and more complex molecules have higher values.

For instance, the molecule Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) has a property value of 0.68420649, and it is a relatively simple aromatic compound. The molecule ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl, which is much more complex, has a much higher property value of 2005.54606835.

Given that ClCC is a small and simple molecule, we can expect its property value to be relatively low. Based on the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be slightly negative, similar to other small aliphatic compounds.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCC is approximately -100.

The molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a pyridine ring and a trichloromethyl group. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms and an aromatic ring suggests that the property value might be relatively high, similar to other chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.

Looking at the examples, the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 2035.37747138, and Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc2 has a property value of 1141.25642809. The presence of additional chlorine atoms in the trichloromethyl group in the target molecule could increase the property value further.

True Property: -534.7757938800023
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCC(C)O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCC(C)O is a primary alcohol with a six-carbon chain, also known as 2-hexanol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- CCCCCCCCl (a seven-carbon chain with a chlorine atom) has a property value of 586.09128075.
- CCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC (a long carbon chain with ester groups) has a property value of 2998.32968774.
- CCCCCC#C (a six-carbon chain with a triple bond) has a property value of -95.17312299.
- CCC(C)CCO (a five-carbon chain with an alcohol group) has a property value of -632.27521894.

The presence of an alcohol group generally decreases the property value compared to a simple alkane or alkyl halide, as seen in the examples. Given that CCCCC(C)O is similar to CCC(C)CCO but with one additional carbon, we can expect the property value to be slightly higher than -632.27521894 due to the increased chain length.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCC(C)O would be around -600.0.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Simple halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have property values that are relatively low or negative. For instance, ClCCl (dichloromethane) has a property value of -627.7594561, and ClC(Cl)Cl (chloroform) has a property value of -241.25120896.

2. The presence of bromine, which is heavier than chlorine, might suggest a slightly higher property value compared to similar chlorinated compounds due to the increased atomic mass and potential changes in electronic effects.

3. The molecule Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O, which is a more complex aromatic compound with multiple functional groups, has a property value of 478.05507572. This suggests that more complex structures with additional functional groups tend to have higher property values.

Considering these points, 1,4-dibromobenzene is a relatively simple aromatic compound with two bromine atoms. It is likely to have a property value that is not as high as more complex aromatic compounds with additional functional groups, but potentially higher than simple chlorinated compounds due to the presence of bromine.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 (1,4-dibromobenzene) would be around 100 to 200. However, given the lack of direct examples with bromine, this is an estimation based on trends observed in the provided data.

Therefore, a predicted property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 could be approximately 150.

The molecule in question, Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl, is a chlorinated biphenyl with multiple chlorine atoms. Comparing it to the example Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 5164.80112293, we notice that both molecules are heavily chlorinated aromatic compounds. However, the given example has more chlorine atoms.

Given the structural similarity but fewer chlorine atoms, we can predict that the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl will be somewhat lower than 5164.80112293. A reasonable estimate, considering the pattern, would be around 4000.0.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -503.30229526372807
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring, with a nitro group (NO2) also attached to the ring.

From the examples, we can identify some relevant patterns:

1. Aromatic rings with substituents tend to have varying property values depending on the nature and number of substituents. For instance:
   - c1ccccc1O (phenol) has a property value of -647.8067063.
   - Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (a chlorinated pyridine) has a property value of 836.57927735.
   - O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (dinitrobenzene) has a property value of -571.99662703.

2. The presence of nitro groups generally contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in the dinitrobenzene example.

3. Methoxy groups (OCH3) are present in some examples, such as COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC (dimethyl terephthalate), which has a property value of -738.3956458.

Considering these observations, the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has both a methoxy group and a nitro group attached to a benzene ring. The methoxy group is likely to contribute a less negative or slightly positive influence, while the nitro group contributes a more negative influence.

Taking into account the structural similarities and the influence of the functional groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around -600. This value reflects the balance between the negative influence of the nitro group and the less negative influence of the methoxy group, similar to the examples provided.

True Property: -1210.7718076382444
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is a simple ester, specifically propyl formate.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Simple aliphatic chains, such as C1CCCCCC1 (cyclohexane), have relatively low property values.
2. Molecules with functional groups like carbonyls, nitro groups, or halogens tend to have more negative property values.
3. The presence of aromatic rings or complex structures often results in higher property values.

CCCOC=O is a small molecule with an ester functional group, which is similar to the example CC(O)c1ccccc1 (phenethyl alcohol), which has a property value of -409.90810915. However, CCCOC=O is simpler and lacks the aromatic ring, which suggests a less negative value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be around -300. This accounts for the presence of the ester group, which contributes to a negative value, but the simplicity of the molecule compared to more complex structures in the examples suggests a less negative value than those with additional functional groups or aromatic rings.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is a linear alkyl ester, specifically decanoate ester, with a long carbon chain and an ester functional group. In the examples, linear alkanes and simple esters tend to have property values that are less negative compared to more complex or aromatic structures.

For instance, the molecule CCCCC(CC)C=O has a property value of 42.89974703, and CCCCCCc1ccccc1 has a property value of 1006.05722533. The presence of an ester group in CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC suggests a property value that is likely less negative than simple alkanes but not as high as aromatic compounds.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around 100 to 200. Therefore, a specific predicted property value could be approximately 150.

- The molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has a property value of 1919.67815365. This molecule has multiple chlorine atoms and two aromatic rings, similar to the molecule in question.

Given these comparisons, the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O is expected to have a property value influenced by the presence of the nitro group, chlorine atoms, and aromatic rings. The presence of the amide linkage may slightly reduce the property value compared to a molecule with only aromatic rings and chlorine atoms.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be around 1500.

True Property: -710.6168622361442
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. The presence of a nitro group (N(=O)=O) tends to have a significant impact on the property value. For instance, Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -298.16350493.

2. The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) on a benzene ring, as seen in Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, has a property value of -285.17726572.

Considering these observations, the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is similar to Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O but with an additional hydroxyl group. The presence of both the nitro and hydroxyl groups on the benzene ring suggests that the property value will be in a similar range to the examples with nitro and hydroxyl groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be approximately -298.16350493, similar to the nitrobenzene example, but slightly adjusted for the additional hydroxyl group. A more precise estimate might be slightly more negative due to the additional electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group, so a predicted value could be around -310.0.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like the one you've provided, based solely on the examples given, involves identifying patterns and trends in the data. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the degree of saturation or unsaturation.

The molecule you've provided, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, is a complex carbohydrate structure, likely a polysaccharide or a similar sugar derivative. These types of molecules are characterized by multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, which contribute to their high degree of hydrogen bonding and overall polarity.

From the examples, it appears that larger, more complex molecules with multiple functional groups tend to have higher property values, often in the positive range, especially when they contain multiple rings and heteroatoms like oxygen. Given the complexity and the presence of numerous hydroxyl groups, which are similar to the structure of sugars, the property value is likely to be quite high.

Based on these observations and the trends in the provided data, I would predict the property value for the given molecule to be approximately 3500.0. This is a rough estimate, considering the complexity and the nature of the molecule compared to the examples provided.

The molecule CCC#C is a small alkyne, specifically 1-butyne, with a linear structure and a triple bond. In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules, especially those with fewer functional groups and lower molecular weights, tend to have property values that are more negative. For instance, the molecule CCC(C)C(=O)C, which is a small ketone, has a property value of -490.91815776, and CCC(C)OC(=O)C, an ester, has a property value of -508.6391059.

Given that CCC#C is a small molecule with a triple bond, we can expect its property value to be in the negative range, similar to other small hydrocarbons or simple functionalized hydrocarbons.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S) with ethyl groups attached.
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings tend to have high property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 3376.55903633.
- The presence of a phosphorothioate group (P=S) in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 results in a high property value of 1363.55511723.

Considering these observations, the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is expected to have a relatively high property value due to the combination of the phosphorothioate group and the chlorinated aromatic ring.

Based on the trends from the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl would be around 1500.0.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the provided data. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of specific functional groups, aromatic rings, and other structural elements.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 contains a pyridine ring (a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring) and a hydrazide group (C(=O)NN). In the examples, molecules with nitrogen-containing aromatic rings and carbonyl groups have varied property values, often negative, but the presence of additional functional groups like nitro or halogens can significantly alter the value.

Considering the structure of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, it is somewhat similar to other nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds with carbonyl groups, which tend to have negative property values. However, the specific combination of a pyridine ring and a hydrazide group is unique among the examples.

Based on these observations and the trends in the examples, I would predict a property value in the negative range, likely around -500 to -600. A reasonable estimate for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 could be approximately:

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 1272.1451299399816
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule contains several functional groups and structural motifs:

1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)S)**: This is a key feature that can influence the property significantly. In the examples, the presence of a phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1 is associated with a property value of 314.95393224.

2. **Amide group (C(=O)N)**: The presence of an amide group can also affect the property. In the example CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, the amide group contributes to a property value of -1443.2651735.

3. **Alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)**: These contribute to the overall hydrophobicity and size of the molecule. In the examples, simple alkyl chains like CCC in CCCc1ccccc1 have a property value of 205.33036815.

4. **Piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)**: This cyclic amine structure can influence the property, as seen in other cyclic structures like C/C1CCCCC1\C with a property value of 337.72432428.

Considering these features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is likely to have a property value that reflects the combined effects of these groups. The phosphorothioate and amide groups suggest a significant impact, while the alkyl chains and piperidine ring contribute to the overall size and hydrophobicity.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around 500. This value accounts for the influence of the phosphorothioate and amide groups, balanced by the hydrophobic and cyclic nature of the rest of the molecule.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 703.2274321262372
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (n-octane), we can look at the examples provided and identify trends or patterns in the data. The examples include various organic molecules with different functional groups and chain lengths, and their associated property values.

The molecule CCCCCCCC is a straight-chain alkane with eight carbon atoms. In the examples, we have:

- CCCCCCCO (heptanol) with a property value of -266.7721111
- CCCCCC/C=C/C (octene) with a property value of 283.0562256
- CCCCCC1CCCC1 (cyclooctane) with a property value of 970.13638452

Considering these examples, the property values for alkanes and similar hydrocarbons tend to be positive and increase with the number of carbon atoms. Since CCCCCCCC is a straight-chain alkane, its property value is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to the value for octene, but lower than cyclooctane due to the lack of a ring structure.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (n-octane) would be around 200.

The examples provided suggest that the property values are influenced by factors such as molecular size, functional groups, and structural complexity.

The molecule in question, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple rings, a hydroxyl group, and an alkyne group. Based on the examples, larger and more complex molecules tend to have higher property values, while the presence of certain functional groups like carbonyls and hydroxyls can also influence the value.

Considering these factors, I would predict that the property value for this molecule is likely to be positive and relatively high, given its structural complexity and functional groups. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around 950.0.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like the one you've provided involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples given. The property values in the examples seem to be related to some form of molecular descriptor or calculated property, possibly related to molecular stability, energy, or a similar concept.

The molecule you've provided, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, is quite complex and contains multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and a significant degree of oxygenation, which suggests a high degree of polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, this molecule might have a relatively high property value compared to simpler structures. However, without a specific model or algorithm to calculate the exact property, I can only provide an estimate based on the trends observed in the examples.

Considering the examples and the structural complexity, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule might be around 2500 to 3000. However, this is a rough estimate and should be verified with a proper computational method or experimental data.

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -200.74618465249824
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to some of the examples provided. For instance, the molecule Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) has a property value of -351.20319217, and the molecule Clc1ccccc1I (iodobenzene) has a property value of 414.35545135. These examples suggest that halogenated benzene rings have property values that can vary significantly depending on the specific halogen and additional functional groups.

Considering the presence of both a hydroxyl group (OH) and a chlorine atom (Cl) on the benzene ring, we can expect the property value to be influenced by both the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine and the electron-donating effect of the hydroxyl group. The presence of the hydroxyl group, which is similar to the nitrophenol example (Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O) with a property value of -710.61686224, suggests a potentially negative contribution to the property value.

Taking into account these factors and the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around -400. This value reflects the combined effects of the hydroxyl and chlorine substituents on the benzene ring, resulting in a property value that is more negative than that of simple halogenated benzenes but less negative than that of nitrophenols.

1. A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C).
2. An ester linkage (OC(=O)).
3. An amide group (NC(=O)).
4. A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1).

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:

- Molecules with halogens, especially multiple chlorines, tend to have higher property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a very high value of 3823.61955798.
- Molecules with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups (like amides and esters) tend to have moderate to high property values, depending on the presence of additional functional groups.
- The presence of an alkyne group is not directly represented in the examples, but it can be considered as a feature that might slightly increase the property value due to its unsaturation.

Considering these factors, the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 has a combination of features that suggest a moderate to high property value. The presence of two chlorine atoms, an aromatic ring, and carbonyl groups (ester and amide) are significant contributors.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around 1200.0.

The given molecule has the following features:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring (c1ccc(Cl)cc1).
- A chlorinated phenyl ring (c3ccccc3Cl).
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2).

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substitutions tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of heterocycles like pyrimidine can influence the property value, often lowering it compared to purely aromatic hydrocarbons.
- The presence of hydroxyl groups (OH) can also affect the property value, often making it more negative.

Considering these factors, the molecule in question has multiple aromatic rings, halogen substitutions, and a pyrimidine ring, which suggests a relatively high property value. However, the presence of the hydroxyl group and the pyrimidine ring might moderate this value.

Based on these observations and comparisons with the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl would be around 1500.

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -943.862855242404
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCOC=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCOC=O is a linear chain with an ester functional group, similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's consider the examples with similar structures:
- CCCCC(=O)OCC: -676.95390285
- CCCCCCC=O: -392.32400232

Both examples have linear carbon chains with carbonyl groups, and their property values are negative. The molecule CCCCCOC=O is an ester, which is similar to the first example, CCCCC(=O)OCC, but with one less carbon in the chain.

Given the trend that longer carbon chains tend to have less negative property values, we can predict that CCCCCOC=O will have a property value slightly more negative than CCCCC(=O)OCC due to the shorter chain length.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be approximately -700.0.

Given that the property values seem to be influenced by the size and complexity of the molecule, we can reasonably predict that ClCCl will have a property value that is somewhat less negative than ClCCCl due to its smaller size. 

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be slightly less negative than -598.6806802. A predicted value could be around -500.0, considering the trend observed in the examples.

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -225.76077398751994
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a methylphenol, specifically p-cresol, which is a simple aromatic compound with a hydroxyl group and a methyl group attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Simple aromatic compounds with hydroxyl groups, such as Oc1cccc(O)c1, have negative property values (e.g., -849.23709745).
2. Aromatic compounds with additional alkyl groups, such as CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, have positive property values (e.g., 331.85383258).

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is similar to the latter example, CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, but with one less methyl group. Therefore, we can expect the property value to be positive but lower than 331.85383258 due to the reduced number of alkyl groups.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be around 100 to 200. Given the examples and the trend, a specific prediction could be approximately:

**150.0**

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 2482.4379930340633
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

The molecule in question, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, is a dichlorinated biphenyl, which is similar in structure to the example Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 3376.55903633. The given molecule has four chlorine atoms and two phenyl rings, which is less complex than the example with six chlorine atoms and two phenyl rings.

Considering the pattern in the examples, the property value seems to increase with the number of chlorine atoms and the complexity of the structure. Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl should be lower than 3376.55903633 but still relatively high due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and two phenyl rings.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl would be approximately 2500.0.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -250.76167919270853
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the degree of unsaturation.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is 2-methyl-1-butene, a small hydrocarbon with a double bond (alkene) and a branched structure. In the examples, small hydrocarbons and alkenes tend to have moderate property values. For instance, the molecule CCCCC(CC)C=O has a property value of 42.89974703, and CCCCCCCC=C has a property value of 1083.78308279. These values suggest that alkenes and small hydrocarbons have property values in the lower to moderate range.

Considering the size and structure of CC=C(C)C, it is smaller than the examples with higher property values and lacks additional functional groups that might significantly alter the property. Therefore, the property value for CC=C(C)C is likely to be closer to the lower end of the range observed for similar hydrocarbons.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C is approximately 150.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -627.7594560963435
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some form of molecular stability, reactivity, or energy.

Dichloromethane is a small, simple molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values, likely due to the increased molecular weight and potential for interactions.

Given the simplicity and small size of ClCCl compared to the other molecules, we can expect its property value to be relatively low. However, the presence of chlorine atoms suggests it might not be as low as the smallest hydrocarbons.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around 100.

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, which is a chlorinated aromatic compound.

From the examples, we can observe that chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which is 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene, has a property value of 693.37485865. Given the structural similarity between 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene and 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene, we can expect their property values to be similar.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl (1,2,4-trichlorobenzene) would be approximately 693.37485865.

True Property: -684.480174254804
Predicted Property:
Predicting the specific property value for the given molecule based on the examples provided is a complex task, as it involves understanding the relationship between molecular structure and the property in question. The examples suggest that the property values are likely related to some form of energy calculation or molecular descriptor, possibly related to stability, reactivity, or electronic properties.

The given molecule, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, is a complex structure with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and a polycyclic framework. This complexity suggests that the property value could be relatively high, as seen in some of the more complex structures in the examples.

Considering the examples with similar complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule might be in the range of 1000 to 2000. Given the specific structural features and the trend observed in the examples, I would predict a property value of approximately 1500.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -1346.1762723373902
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A thioether group (CS-)
- A pyrazole ring (1,2,4-triazole-like structure)
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- An amine group (N)
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of halogens, especially multiple chlorines, tends to increase the property value significantly.
- Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) also tend to have negative property values.

The molecule in question does not have halogens or nitro groups, but it does have a carbonyl group and a tert-butyl group, which might slightly increase the property value compared to simpler structures.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be around -900. This is based on the presence of the carbonyl and tert-butyl groups, which are somewhat similar to the structures with negative values in the examples. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

-900

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -325.47702808177735
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ester group (COOC) attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can identify a few relevant molecules:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 has a property value of -798.74265836. This molecule is more complex than ethyl benzoate, with additional functional groups like sulfonamide and a heterocyclic ring.

2. CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of -223.80394342. This molecule is benzil, which has two ketone groups attached to a benzene ring.

3. Cc1cccc2c1Cc3ccccc32 has a property value of 839.67189069. This molecule is a naphthalene derivative, which is more complex than a simple benzene ring.

4. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 is a more complex molecule with a property value of -798.74265836.

Considering the structure of ethyl benzoate, which is simpler than the complex molecules with additional functional groups, and comparing it to benzil, which has a property value of -223.80394342, we can infer that ethyl benzoate will have a property value that is less negative than benzil due to the absence of additional carbonyl groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) would be around -200.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 692.8959141021991
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the size of the carbon chain, and the presence of halogens.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with seven carbon atoms and a bromine atom attached. In the examples, we have:

- CCCCCCCCO (octanol) with a property value of -266.7721111.
- Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (bromobenzene) with a property value of 864.35806091.

The presence of bromine in the molecule CCCCCCCBr is similar to the bromobenzene example, but the structure is more similar to the linear alkyl chain of octanol. The property value for octanol is negative, indicating a certain trend for linear alkyl chains, while the presence of bromine in bromobenzene results in a positive value.

Considering the linear structure of CCCCCCCBr and the influence of the bromine atom, the property value is likely to be between the values for octanol and bromobenzene. However, due to the linear nature and the single bromine atom, the value should be closer to the negative side, similar to other linear alkyl chains.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around -100.0.

SMILES: CO
True Property: -1868.2258254725507
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for carbon monoxide (CO) based on the given examples is challenging without knowing the specific property being measured. However, I can attempt to make a prediction by considering the general trends in the data.

The examples provided show a wide range of property values, both positive and negative, for various organic and inorganic compounds. The property values seem to be influenced by the molecular structure, functional groups, and possibly the size or complexity of the molecule.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is much smaller and less complex than most of the molecules in the examples. Given its simplicity and the fact that it is a small, neutral molecule, it is likely to have a property value that is relatively low in magnitude compared to larger, more complex molecules.

Based on this reasoning, I would predict a property value for CO that is close to zero, but slightly negative due to its small size and simplicity. A reasonable estimate might be around -50, considering the range of values provided and the nature of CO as a small, simple molecule.
