SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.5758244669987017
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the trends and patterns from the given examples. The molecule in question is a linear ester with a long alkyl chain, similar to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Linear alkanes and their derivatives tend to have negative property values, with the magnitude decreasing as the chain length increases.
- Esters, such as COC(=O)c1cccnc1 (0.29661095) and CCOC(=O)CC (0.74402761), tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of an ester group generally increases the property value compared to a simple alkane.

Given these observations, the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is expected to have a positive property value, as it is an ester with a relatively long alkyl chain. Comparing it to the similar molecule CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (0.58656596), which has one less carbon in the alkyl chain, we can predict that the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC will be slightly higher due to the additional carbon.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is approximately 0.63656596.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 0.4846968159002285
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxo group and a nitrogen atom. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings and heteroatoms.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups like Cl and carbonyls tend to have positive property values, as seen in examples like Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (4.59380356) and Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 (1.4278277).
- Compounds with heteroatoms like nitrogen and oxygen in a ring structure can also have positive property values, as seen in c1cncnc1 (0.73516671).

Considering these observations, the presence of chlorine, the carbonyl group, and the nitrogen in the heterocyclic structure of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 suggests that the property value is likely to be positive, but not as high as those with multiple chlorines or extensive conjugation.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around 0.8.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.8691113790813418
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O). In the examples, nitro-containing compounds such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO have a positive property value (0.85085949). The presence of the nitro group generally contributes to a positive property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

Additionally, the isopropyl group is a small alkyl group, which in some examples (e.g., CCC(C)CC, 0.06511279) contributes to a slightly positive or neutral property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is likely to be positive, but not as high as the example with a larger aromatic system. A reasonable prediction would be around 0.5, given the influence of the nitro group and the small alkyl chain.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is approximately 0.5.

True Property: -0.9081888216196226
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO

This molecule is a polycyclic compound with multiple rings and carbonyl groups, similar to some of the examples provided. Notably, it resembles the structure of steroids, which are complex polycyclic compounds.

Looking at the examples, the molecule CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C has a property value of -0.91673605. This molecule is also a polycyclic compound with carbonyl groups, similar to the given molecule.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of multiple rings and carbonyl groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for the given molecule will be in a similar range. Therefore, I would predict the property value for the molecule CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO to be approximately:

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: -0.7616957391208914
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A benzene ring with two fluorine atoms (Fc1cccc(F)c1), similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of 0.62296334.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N), which is a common feature in several molecules but not directly comparable to any specific example.
- A chlorobenzene ring (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), similar to Clc1cccc(Cl)c1, which has a property value of 1.02070765.

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like fluorine and chlorine, along with the amide linkage, suggests that the property value might be influenced by these electronegative atoms and the polar nature of the amide group.

Considering the examples, the property values for molecules with halogens and aromatic rings tend to be positive, often above 0.5. The presence of two fluorines and a chlorine, along with the amide linkage, suggests a property value that is likely positive and potentially in the range of the examples with similar features.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be around 0.7.

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.08607944873202328
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with an alkyl chain. It is similar in structure to other small aliphatic ethers and alcohols in the examples, such as CCCC(C)CO (0.24400547) and CCCCCCO (-0.54881257). These molecules have relatively small property values, indicating that the presence of an ether or alcohol group in a small alkyl chain tends to result in a property value around zero, slightly positive or negative.

Given the structure of CCCOC(C)C, which is a small ether with a branched alkyl group, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly positive, similar to CCCC(C)CO.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is approximately 0.2.

True Property: 3.847415045831764
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. Let's break down the structural features:

1. **Presence of Bromine (Br):** In the examples, the presence of bromine in aromatic systems (e.g., CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1) is associated with a property value of 0.02750618. However, the context and other functional groups can significantly influence the property.

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O):** The presence of carbonyl groups is common in several examples, often contributing to a more negative property value due to their electron-withdrawing nature.

3. **Aromatic System:** The molecule has an aromatic pyrrole ring, which is a common feature in several examples. Aromatic systems can have varying effects depending on substitution patterns.

4. **Alkyl Chain (CCC(C)):** The presence of an alkyl chain can contribute to a more positive property value, as seen in examples like CCC(C)CC (0.06511279).

Considering these features, the molecule has both electron-withdrawing groups (carbonyls and bromine) and an alkyl chain, which can have opposing effects on the property value. The presence of the pyrrole ring and the specific substitution pattern will also influence the property.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O would be slightly negative, reflecting the balance between the electron-withdrawing effects and the alkyl chain.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.4202356132948588
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

Biphenyl is a simple aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples, aromatic hydrocarbons and similar structures tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule C1CCc2ccccc2C1, which is a cyclohexylbenzene, has a property value of -0.47027879, and the molecule c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a property value of -0.72718637.

Given that biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic compound without additional functional groups that might significantly alter its property value, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is negative and similar to other simple aromatic hydrocarbons.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) is approximately -0.5.

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of molecular structures with different functional groups and sizes, and their property values range from negative to positive.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a sulfur atom at the end. This structure is similar to alkanes, which generally have low or slightly negative property values in the given examples. The presence of sulfur, which is more electronegative than carbon, might slightly influence the property value, but not drastically.

Considering the examples, linear alkanes like CCCCC (pentane) would likely have a property value close to zero or slightly negative. The addition of a sulfur atom might make the property slightly more negative due to its electronegativity and potential for polarizability.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be slightly negative, around -0.1 to -0.2. Therefore, I would predict the property value for CCCCCS to be approximately:

-0.15

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 2.5902575223612883
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol, specifically 2-methyl-2-butanol. In the examples, we have several aliphatic and branched hydrocarbons, as well as alcohols, which can help us make a prediction.

- The molecule CCC(C)(C)C (2,2-dimethylpropane) has a property value of 1.41279744.
- The molecule CCCC(C)(O)CC (2-methyl-2-pentanol) has a property value of 2.59025752.
- The molecule CC(C)CC(C)O (2-methyl-2-butanol) has a property value of 0.58245029.

The structure of CCCC(C)(C)CO is similar to these examples, particularly to 2-methyl-2-pentanol, which is a branched alcohol with a similar carbon backbone. The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) in alcohols tends to increase the property value compared to alkanes.

Considering these comparisons, the predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is likely to be close to that of 2-methyl-2-pentanol, but slightly lower due to the shorter carbon chain. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO is approximately:

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.23679145406559984
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is 9-methylphenanthrene, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:

1. Molecules with multiple aromatic rings, such as Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 and Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, have property values of -0.30272077 and 0.56150707, respectively.
2. The presence of methyl groups (C) on aromatic rings tends to increase the property value, as seen in Cc1cccc(C)c1C (1.81532036) and Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1 (1.4278277).

Given that Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is similar to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 but with an additional aromatic ring, we can expect the property value to be in a similar range but potentially slightly higher due to the additional aromaticity and the presence of a methyl group.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 would be around 0.6.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic imide, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of 0.57111465. The main difference in the new molecule is the presence of a longer alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) attached to the cyclic imide structure.

The addition of an alkyl chain generally increases hydrophobicity, which can affect the property value. However, the core structure remains similar to the example provided, suggesting that the property value might not deviate significantly from the example.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be slightly higher than 0.57111465 due to the increased hydrophobicity from the longer alkyl chain. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.6.

To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which contains a benzene ring substituted with a trifluoromethyl group.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with halogen substitutions tend to have positive property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of 0.8493949, and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 also has a property value of 0.8493949. These examples suggest that halogenated aromatic compounds generally have positive property values.

Considering the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group, which is more electronegative than chlorine or bromine, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 will also be positive and potentially higher than those of the halogenated examples provided.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be approximately 1.0.

The molecule in question, OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, is a sugar alcohol, specifically a form of glucose, which is a polyol with multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups.

In the examples, the molecule OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, which is similar in structure as it also contains multiple hydroxyl groups, has a property value of 10.61750723. Given the structural similarity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O would be similar.

Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately 10.61750723.

This molecule is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Cyclic Structure**: The molecule has a polycyclic structure similar to some of the examples provided, such as CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of -0.93663865.

2. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains ketone groups (C=O) and an ester group (CC(=O)O). These groups are known to influence the property values, often contributing to negative values due to their electron-withdrawing nature.

3. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (C3(O) and C(O)) can also affect the property, potentially increasing the value due to their polar nature.

4. **Overall Complexity**: The complexity and the presence of multiple rings and functional groups suggest a property value that is likely negative, similar to other complex cyclic structures with ketones and esters.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.9, similar to the example with a similar structural complexity and functional groups.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C is approximately:

It resembles some of the more complex structures in the examples, such as CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of -0.90495733. This example also contains multiple cyclohexane rings and an oxygen-containing functional group.

Considering the structural similarities, particularly the presence of multiple cyclohexane rings and a ketone group, the property value for the given molecule is likely to be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O would be approximately -0.9.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is an acetanilide derivative with a nitro group attached to the aromatic ring. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those containing aromatic rings with nitro groups and amide linkages.

From the examples:
- O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of 0.67299068.
- COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of 1.20030883.
- O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.63707077.

The presence of the nitro group generally increases the property value, as seen in the examples. The amide linkage (CC(=O)N) is also present in some examples with negative property values, such as CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1 with -0.58942037.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O would likely be influenced by the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group and the amide linkage. Balancing these influences, a reasonable prediction would be a value slightly positive, but not as high as the nitrobenzene example.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O could be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group, an ester linkage, a thioether, and a chlorinated aromatic ring, along with a heterocyclic structure.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with halogenated aromatic rings, such as Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (0.46202816) and Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl (-0.20644544), have varying property values depending on the specific structure and additional functional groups present. The presence of a phosphorothioate group and a thioether linkage might influence the property value towards a more negative range, as seen in some sulfur-containing compounds like CSSC (-0.80420303).

Considering these factors and the structural complexity of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be around -0.5. This accounts for the influence of the sulfur-containing groups and the chlorinated aromatic ring, which tend to lower the property value compared to simpler structures.

True Property: 1.4127974399021008
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CC(C)(C)CO is tert-butanol, which is a simple alcohol with a tertiary carbon structure.

Looking at the examples, we can see that alcohols generally have positive property values, such as CCCCCCC(C)O with a value of 0.04920123 and CCCCCCCC(C)O with a value of 0.10649463. These examples suggest that the presence of an alcohol group contributes positively to the property value.

Given that tert-butanol is a smaller and more compact alcohol compared to the longer chain alcohols in the examples, we can expect its property value to be positive but likely smaller than those of the longer chain alcohols.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO (tert-butanol) would be around 0.05.

The molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is a bicyclic compound with two nitrogen-containing heterocycles, specifically a purine-like structure. This structure is similar to the example Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F, which has a property value of 2.34049479. Both molecules contain nitrogen atoms in a heterocyclic ring, which can contribute to similar electronic properties.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of nitrogen atoms in a heterocyclic framework, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 will be in a similar range. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately 2.34 for this molecule.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, an ester. 

From the examples, we can observe that esters generally have a range of property values. For instance, CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC has a property value of 9.03345938, while CCC(C)C(=O)C has a property value of 2.38816575. However, these examples are not directly comparable due to differences in molecular size and functional groups.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is relatively small and simple, similar to CC(C)O, which has a property value of -0.56346424. Given the structural similarity and the presence of an ester group, we can expect the property value to be in a similar range, but slightly different due to the ester functionality.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a symmetrical urea derivative with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. 

Looking at the examples, aromatic compounds with amide or urea linkages tend to have property values around the range of 0.2 to 1.0. For instance, NC(=O)c1cccnc1 has a property value of 0.67299068, and Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.99023874. These examples suggest that the presence of aromatic rings and carbonyl groups contribute positively to the property value.

Given the structure of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, which is similar to these examples but with two phenyl groups, we can expect the property value to be in a similar range. Considering the symmetry and the presence of two phenyl groups, the property value might be slightly higher than the single phenyl examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 would be around 0.8.

To predict the property value for the molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The given molecule is triphenylene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a planar structure composed of four fused benzene rings.

In the examples, we have several aromatic compounds and polycyclic structures. For instance, the molecule c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon similar to triphenylene, has a property value of -0.66972918. Other aromatic compounds, such as Fc1cccc(F)c1, have positive property values, but these are typically influenced by the presence of electronegative substituents like fluorine.

Triphenylene, being a neutral polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon without additional substituents, is likely to have a property value similar to other neutral aromatic hydrocarbons. Based on the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for triphenylene would be slightly negative, reflecting its aromatic nature and lack of polar substituents.

Therefore, the predicted property value for C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (triphenylene) is approximately -0.67.

- A sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O)), which is often associated with polar and electron-withdrawing characteristics.
- An aromatic ring (c1ccc(N)cc1) with an amine substituent, which can contribute to electron-donating properties.
- An amidine group (NC(=N)N), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.

From the examples, molecules with polar functional groups and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values, especially when they contain electron-withdrawing groups like sulfonamides or nitro groups. For instance, molecules with nitro groups or sulfonamides, such as O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O (-0.63707077) and Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O (-0.60829528), have negative values.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is likely to be negative. Based on the trends observed, a reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.5.

True Property: 6.278232512114524
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is known to contribute to a positive property value based on examples like Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (0.99023874).
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) attached to the aromatic ring, which can also contribute to a positive property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
- An alkene group (CC(C)=C) attached to the nitrogen, which can have varying effects depending on the context but generally does not contribute significantly to a positive or negative shift.
- The presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups (two nitro groups and a trifluoromethyl group) suggests a strong electron-withdrawing effect, which can lead to a positive property value.

Considering these factors and comparing with the examples, the molecule is likely to have a positive property value, but not as high as those with only one nitro group or other strongly positive-contributing groups. A reasonable prediction, considering the balance of electron-withdrawing effects, would be around 0.8 to 1.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O is approximately 0.9.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.20092436822727996
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl acetate, an ester. In the examples, we have several esters and similar functional groups:

1. CC(C)CCOC=O, 0.20058392
2. CCCC=O, -0.48420719
3. CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, 0.06416794
4. CCCCOC(=O)C, 0.23670992

The property values for these molecules range from -0.48420719 to 0.23670992. The molecule CC(C)OC=O is structurally similar to CC(C)CCOC=O, which has a property value of 0.20058392, but with a shorter carbon chain. It is also similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, which has a property value of 0.06416794, but without the aromatic ring.

Considering these comparisons, the property value for CC(C)OC=O is likely to be positive and closer to the lower end of the range due to its smaller size and lack of additional functional groups that might significantly alter the property.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O is approximately 0.150.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the examples given.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is structurally similar to c1ccccc1O (phenol), which has a property value of 0.80992282. The presence of additional methyl groups in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 could slightly alter the property value due to increased hydrophobicity and potential steric effects.

Considering the examples and the structural similarity, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be slightly higher than that of phenol due to the additional methyl group. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 1.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question has a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)O) attached to an aromatic ring, similar to the examples COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, all of which have a property value of 0.96647992. These examples have halogen substituents on the aromatic ring, which can influence the property value.

In the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, the aromatic ring has a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) as substituents. The presence of the thiomethyl group could have a similar electron-withdrawing effect as the halogens in the examples, while the methyl group is electron-donating.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of the substituents, the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be close to the values of the similar examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately 0.96647992.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we can observe that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values. For instance:
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 3.20726863.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.06429327.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.33049383.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is similar to these examples, particularly the last one, which has a similar structure and degree of chlorination. Therefore, we can predict that the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl will be close to the value of the similar example.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately 0.33.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.24261119412382215
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to the end. The presence of the nitro group is significant because it is an electron-withdrawing group, which can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, tend to have higher property values. However, these examples also have additional aromatic rings and other electron-withdrawing groups, which contribute to their higher values.

In contrast, simpler aliphatic chains without such groups, like CCC, have lower property values. The presence of the nitro group in CCCN(=O)=O will increase the property value compared to CCC, but not to the extent seen in more complex molecules with multiple nitro groups and aromatic systems.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O is likely to be slightly higher than that of simple aliphatic chains like CCC, but significantly lower than those with multiple nitro groups and aromatic systems. A reasonable estimate would be around 0.5.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 1.020707654773106
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, which is similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's consider the examples with similar structures:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of 0.8493949.
- c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12 has a property value of 0.23679145.

Both examples involve a benzene ring with a halogen substituent. The presence of a fluorine atom in Fc1cccc(Br)c1 might influence the property value due to its high electronegativity, potentially increasing the value compared to the bromine-only substituted benzene.

Given these considerations, the predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is likely to be slightly higher than the example with only bromine substitution. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be approximately 0.9.

True Property: -0.4901513095735209
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group, similar to some of the examples given.

Looking at the examples, we notice that molecules with tertiary alcohol groups, such as CCC(C)(C)O (1.34786429) and CC(C)(C)CO (1.41279744), tend to have positive property values. The presence of a bicyclic structure, as seen in some examples like CC1CCCO1 (-0.67922623), can influence the property value, but the presence of the alcohol group in the current molecule is likely to have a more significant impact.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is likely to be positive, similar to other tertiary alcohols. A reasonable estimate, taking into account the structural similarities and the influence of the alcohol group, would be around 1.3. Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)
- An amide linkage (N2C(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)

Comparing this structure to the examples:
- The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O has a similar phosphorothioate group and an amide linkage, with a property value of -0.61288383.
- The presence of a phenyl ring is common in many examples, such as COc1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 0.37328957, and COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC with a property value of 1.34489065.

The molecule in question lacks the additional sulfur-containing group (SC(CCl)) present in the example with a similar phosphorothioate group, which might slightly increase the property value compared to -0.61288383.

Considering these structural similarities and differences, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be slightly less negative than -0.61288383, but still negative due to the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage.

Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.55.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzoyl group attached to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of -0.45459245. Both molecules contain aromatic rings and nitrogen heterocycles, but the example molecule has an additional aromatic ring and a more complex heterocyclic structure.

Given the structural similarities and the presence of aromatic and heterocyclic features, we can predict that the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C will be in a similar range, but likely slightly less negative due to its simpler structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be approximately -0.40.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.9230735489302836
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which is a linear chain with a total of 9 carbon atoms.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCCCC(=O)OC, which is a similar ester with a slightly shorter chain, has a property value of 0.57787997.
- CCCCC, a simple alkane, has a property value of -0.67449076.
- CCCCCS, a thiol with a similar chain length, also has a property value of -0.67449076.

The presence of the ester functional group (C(=O)O) in CCCCCCC(=O)OCC suggests that its property value will be closer to that of CCCCCCC(=O)OC, but potentially slightly higher due to the additional carbon in the ethyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be slightly higher than 0.57787997, perhaps around 0.6. However, without exact calculations or more specific data, this is an estimation based on the trends observed in the examples.

True Property: 0.2966109515850316
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is methyl benzoate, which is an ester derived from benzoic acid.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Esters like CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 have a property value of 0.06416794.
2. Another ester, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, has a property value of -0.05838981.

Given that the structure of methyl benzoate is similar to the second example, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, it is reasonable to predict a similar property value. Therefore, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.05838981.

True Property: -0.13144031933793848
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear conjugated diene, which is similar in structure to some of the simpler hydrocarbons and aromatic compounds in the examples.

Looking at the examples, simpler hydrocarbons and conjugated systems tend to have property values that are not extremely high or low. For instance, the molecule C=Cc1ccccc1 (styrene) has a property value of 0.70487653, and CCC(C)(C)CC (a branched alkane) has a property value of 2.5015281. The molecule CC/C=C/C (a linear alkene) has a property value of -0.18414849.

Given that C=CCC=C is a simple linear conjugated diene, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would be closer to the lower end of the range for hydrocarbons, similar to the linear alkene example.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C would be around -0.18414849, similar to the linear alkene example.

True Property: -0.5634642353926878
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular size and complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br, also known as bromoform, is a small, simple molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly bromine, tend to have positive property values. For instance, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of 0.23679145, and Ic1cccc2ccccc12 has a property value of 0.46202816. These examples suggest that the presence of halogens, especially in aromatic systems, contributes to positive property values.

However, BrC(Br)Br is not an aromatic compound, and its structure is simpler than the examples provided. The presence of multiple bromine atoms might increase the property value due to their high atomic mass and potential influence on molecular properties.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be a positive value, likely higher than the simpler halogenated aromatic compounds but not as high as the more complex molecules with multiple functional groups. A predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br could be around 1.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 0.26965954.
- An amide linkage (N-C=O), which is present in several molecules with varying property values.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is a feature in several molecules with both positive and negative property values.
- A phenyl group (c1ccccc1), which is common in many of the examples.

Given the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage, the molecule might have a property value close to that of COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1. However, the additional chlorinated carbon and the overall structure might slightly alter the property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 0.2.

To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Functional Groups and Structural Features:**
   - The molecule contains a tertiary amide group (CN(C)C(=O)N), which is similar to the structure CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C with a property value of 5.12997739.
   - It has a chlorinated aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O with a property value of 0.74680771.
   - The molecule also contains a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen atoms, which can be compared to other heterocyclic structures in the examples.

2. **Comparison with Examples:**
   - The presence of a tertiary amide group in CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C suggests a potentially high property value.
   - The chlorinated aromatic ring might lower the property value compared to the non-chlorinated analogs.
   - The heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen could contribute to a moderate property value, as seen in other examples with similar features.

3. **Balancing the Influences:**
   - The high property value from the tertiary amide group might be moderated by the presence of the chlorinated aromatic ring and the heterocyclic structure.
   - Considering the examples, the property value is likely to be positive but not as high as the simple tertiary amide example.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be around 1.5.

This structure is somewhat similar to the example Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, which has a property value of 3.20726863. However, the example has four chlorine atoms on a single phenyl ring, while the target molecule has three chlorine atoms distributed across two rings.

2. **Chlorine Influence**: Chlorine atoms generally increase the property value, as seen in the examples. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms in the molecule suggests a higher property value.

3. **Comparison with Similar Structures**: The example Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 has a property value of -0.17930993. This structure has two chlorine atoms on one phenyl ring and another phenyl ring without chlorine, which is somewhat similar to the target molecule but with fewer chlorine atoms.

4. **Ether Linkage**: The ether linkage (O-phenyl-O) might slightly reduce the property value compared to a fully chlorinated phenyl ring, as seen in the example Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl with a property value of 1.4278277.

Considering these factors, the target molecule is expected to have a property value influenced by the presence of chlorine atoms and the ether linkage. Given the examples and the structural similarities, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be around 2.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC/C=C\C, we can look at the example provided for a similar molecule, CC/C=C/C, which has a property value of -0.18414849. The only difference between the two molecules is the stereochemistry around the double bond, which is unlikely to have a significant impact on the property value in this context.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCCOCC is a linear chain with an ether functional group, similar to some of the examples given.

Looking at the examples, we can see that simple linear alkanes and ethers tend to have property values around zero, with slight variations depending on the specific structure and functional groups. For instance, CCC(O)CC has a property value of 0.06511279, which is a similar structure with an alcohol group instead of an ether.

Given the structure of CCCOCC and its similarity to other simple ethers and alkanes, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be close to zero. Therefore, I would predict the property value for CCCOCC to be approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

This molecule is a tertiary amide with two phenyl rings and a tertiary butyl group. The presence of aromatic rings and the amide functional group suggests that the property value might be similar to other molecules with similar features.

Looking at the examples:
- CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 has a property value of -0.92117665.
- CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23 has a property value of -0.92023243.

Both of these molecules contain amide groups and aromatic rings, similar to the target molecule. The presence of the tertiary butyl group in the target molecule might slightly alter the property value, but it is likely to remain in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be approximately -0.92.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-), which is a polar functional group.
- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1), which is a benzene ring with a bromine substituent.

From the examples:
- Molecules with acetamide or similar polar groups tend to have negative property values, indicating a polar or hydrophilic nature.
- Molecules with bromobenzene or similar aromatic halogenated structures tend to have positive property values, indicating a more hydrophobic nature.

Balancing these observations, the presence of both a polar acetamide group and a hydrophobic bromobenzene moiety suggests a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero, as the polar and non-polar characteristics may partially offset each other.

Considering the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around -0.1.

The structure CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is similar to cumene (CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1) and ethylbenzene (CCc1ccc(C)cc1), both of which have property values around 0.37 to 0.41. Given the similarity in structure, particularly with cumene, we can predict that the property value for isobutylbenzene (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1) will be close to these values.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is approximately 0.40.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.7048765283543004
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:

1. Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have higher property values, often above 1.
2. Molecules with multiple halogens, especially chlorine, tend to have higher property values, often above 2.
3. Simple hydrocarbons or those with small functional groups like alcohols or ethers tend to have lower property values, often below 1.
4. Molecules with carbonyl groups (C=O) attached to aromatic rings, like NC(=O)c1ccccc1O, have property values around 1.34.

Benzaldehyde has a carbonyl group attached to a benzene ring, similar to the example NC(=O)c1ccccc1O, which has a property value of 1.34078714. However, benzaldehyde lacks the additional hydroxyl group present in that example, which might slightly lower its property value.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) would be slightly below 1.34, perhaps around 1.2. Therefore, the predicted property value for O=Cc1ccccc1 is approximately:

1.2

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples.
- An oxazole ring, which is a five-membered heterocyclic ring containing nitrogen and oxygen.
- Amide groups (C=O)N, which are also present in some of the examples.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with nitro groups attached to aromatic rings tend to have negative property values (e.g., Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2, -0.66331771).
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings and amide groups also tend to have negative property values (e.g., CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, -0.72626416).

Considering these observations, the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is likely to have a negative property value. Based on the structural similarities and trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.7. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule is approximately -0.7.

True Property: -0.8124598972897291
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group (N-N linkage).

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with similar aromatic structures and nitrogen linkages tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 has a property value of -0.69672991. This molecule is similar in that it also contains two phenyl rings connected by a nitrogen linkage, although it has a different nitrogen configuration (azo group instead of hydrazine).

Given the structural similarities and the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 will also be negative and close to the value of the similar example.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is approximately -0.7.

True Property: -0.5781617603467847
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a bicyclic structure with two amide groups. In the examples, similar cyclic structures with amide groups, such as O=C1N(COC(=O)CC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3, have a property value of -0.77360732, and O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC has a property value of 0.89931429.

Considering the structural similarity to these examples, particularly the diketopiperazine core, the property value is likely to be negative due to the presence of multiple carbonyl groups and the cyclic nature, which often contribute to lower property values in this context.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.5.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.24567431154231073
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccccc1Cl (1.25968537) and Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (-0.39926918), tend to have positive property values, but the presence of additional functional groups or structural complexity can lead to negative values.
- The presence of aromatic rings, as seen in many examples, often results in positive property values, but again, this can be influenced by other substituents.

Given that Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a relatively simple PCB with three chlorine atoms and no additional functional groups that might significantly alter the property, we can expect its property value to be similar to other chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 0.8, similar to other chlorinated aromatic compounds like Ic1ccccc1 (0.80992282). Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately:

True Property: 0.16108204974988416
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:

1. Aromatic compounds with simple alkyl substitutions, such as Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) with a property value of 1.25968537, tend to have positive property values.
2. Molecules with more complex or polar functional groups, such as those containing nitro groups or halogens, often have negative or lower property values.
3. The presence of additional alkyl groups tends to increase the property value slightly, as seen in CCC(CC)C=O (1.39462538) compared to CCC(=O)C (0.28314385).

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a relatively simple aromatic compound with two ethyl groups, it is likely to have a positive property value, similar to other simple alkyl-substituted aromatics.

Based on these observations, I would predict the property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 to be approximately 1.2.

True Property: 1.5730001728852196
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is a para-substituted aniline with a sulfonamide group. In the examples, we have a few molecules with similar aromatic structures and functional groups:

1. Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12, with a property value of 0.57269917, is a nitrogen-containing heterocycle.
2. Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, with a property value of 0.74680771, is a para-substituted aniline with a nitro group.
3. Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, with a property value of 2.40146285, is a dinitro-substituted aromatic compound.

The molecule in question has a sulfonamide group, which is less electron-withdrawing than a nitro group but still contributes to the overall electron-withdrawing nature of the substituent. The presence of the sulfonamide group suggests that the property value might be closer to that of the nitro-substituted aniline (0.74680771) rather than the dinitro compound (2.40146285).

Considering the electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonamide group and the aromatic ring, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be slightly lower than that of the nitro-substituted aniline, due to the less electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonamide compared to the nitro group.

Therefore, a predicted property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O could be approximately 0.6.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically triphenylene. In the examples, similar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54, have a property value of -0.72253198. This suggests that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values.

Considering the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 is likely to be in the same range as other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately -0.72.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the other polycyclic aromatic compounds in the examples, particularly those with multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings, such as Oc1cccc(O)c1 (1.02070765) and Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 (-0.77572969), have property values that are relatively high compared to other types of compounds.

Given the structural similarity to these examples, particularly the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings, the property value for the given molecule is likely to be positive and relatively high. However, the presence of the ketone group and the specific arrangement of the rings may moderate this value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 would be around 0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphoric acid ester group (COP(=O)(OC)).
- A thioester linkage (SC).
- An amide linkage (NC(C)=O).

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with phosphoric acid ester groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl and CCN(CC)C(=O)C(=CCOP(=O)(OC)OC)Cl, have relatively high property values (0.96647992 and 26.73007948, respectively).
- Molecules with thioester linkages, such as CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, have a lower property value (-0.36485518).
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1, have a property value of 0.02750618.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values, the presence of the phosphoric acid ester group suggests a higher property value, while the thioester and amide linkages might moderate this effect.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around 0.5. This value reflects the influence of the phosphoric acid ester group, moderated by the presence of the thioester and amide linkages.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.29793485571623635
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular structure.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, symmetrical molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. In the examples, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly chlorine, tend to have positive property values, especially when they are part of aromatic systems or when multiple chlorine atoms are present.

For instance, the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of 1.4278277, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.06429327. These examples show that the presence of chlorine can contribute to a positive property value, although the specific value can vary based on the molecular context.

Given the small size and symmetry of Cl\C=C/Cl, and considering the influence of the chlorine atoms, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be slightly positive. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.1 for Cl\C=C/Cl.

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 0.7351667138627583
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and their properties. Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle similar to benzene but with a nitrogen atom replacing one of the carbon atoms in the ring. 

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23, have a property value of -0.20405599. Another example, CNc1ccccc1, which is aniline, has a property value of 0.24466459. Pyridine is less electron-rich than aniline due to the presence of the nitrogen atom, which is more electronegative than carbon and can withdraw electron density from the ring.

Considering these factors and the trend in the examples, pyridine is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative, reflecting its electron-withdrawing nature compared to benzene and aniline. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of pyridine (c1ccncc1) would be around -0.15.

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: -0.8449419291682703
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has several key features:
1. An ester linkage (OC(=O)).
2. A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1).
3. An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23).
4. A pyridine-like structure (ccnc).
5. A chlorine substituent on an aromatic ring.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with ester linkages, such as CCCOCC(=O)CC and CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC, tend to have positive property values.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2 and O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of chlorine on an aromatic ring, as seen in Clc1ccc(I)cc1 and Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, can lead to both positive and negative values, depending on the overall structure.

Considering these factors, the molecule in question has both positive and negative contributing features. The ester linkage and the aromatic rings might contribute to a positive value, while the amide linkage and the pyridine-like structure might contribute to a negative value. The chlorine substituent could also influence the value, but its effect is less clear.

Balancing these factors, the property value is likely to be slightly negative, as the negative contributions from the amide and pyridine-like structure might outweigh the positive contributions from the ester linkage and aromatic rings.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 is approximately -0.5.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.548812566481886
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the trends and characteristics of the given examples. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol with a five-carbon chain, also known as pentanol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Linear alkanes and alcohols tend to have positive property values. For instance, CCCCCC (hexane) has a property value of 1.05535256.
2. The presence of an alcohol group (OH) generally increases the property value compared to the corresponding alkane, as seen with OC1CCCCCCC1 (cycloheptanol) having a negative value, but this is due to its cyclic nature.

Considering these observations, CCCCCO (pentanol) is expected to have a positive property value, likely slightly higher than that of a similar alkane due to the presence of the alcohol group.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be around 1.1.

True Property: -0.598369722937809
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is often associated with polar and electron-withdrawing characteristics.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which can also contribute to polarity and hydrogen bonding.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which is common in many of the examples and can contribute to stability and hydrophobic interactions.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can add to the molecule's polarity.

From the examples, molecules with polar groups and aromatic rings tend to have a wide range of property values, often depending on the specific combination and arrangement of functional groups. For instance, molecules with sulfonyl groups and aromatic rings, like CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C, have a relatively high property value (0.91239516), while others with different arrangements can have lower or even negative values.

Considering the presence of both polar and aromatic features, and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be around 0.5. This value reflects the balance between the polar and aromatic characteristics of the molecule.

Predicting the property value for the given molecule, COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule contains several functional groups, including ester groups, a nitro group, and an aromatic ring, which can influence its properties.

Based on the examples, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, while the presence of ester groups can vary in their influence. Considering these factors and the complexity of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be slightly positive.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C is approximately 0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two carbonyl groups and a cycloalkane structure. In the examples, molecules with carbonyl groups and cyclic structures tend to have negative property values, often due to the presence of polar functional groups and the overall molecular geometry.

For instance, the molecule ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of -0.5407843, and it contains carbonyl groups and a cyclic structure. Similarly, other cyclic molecules with carbonyl groups, such as CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, have negative property values.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be negative. Based on the trends in the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.5.

SMILES: ClCC
True Property: -0.9263596343631936
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of molecular structures with different functional groups and sizes, and their property values range from negative to positive.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure with a chlorine atom attached to a two-carbon chain. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons like CCCCC and CCC1CCCCC1 have negative property values, while aromatic compounds with chlorine, such as Clc1ccccc1, have positive values. However, ClCC is not aromatic and is more similar to simple hydrocarbons.

Considering the examples, the presence of chlorine in non-aromatic compounds does not necessarily lead to a positive property value. For instance, ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl has a negative value. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that ClCC will have a negative property value, similar to other simple hydrocarbons.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC is approximately -0.5.

   - Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -0.30897556.

2. Compounds with multiple chlorine atoms, especially those with trichloromethyl groups, also tend to have negative property values. For example:
   - ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O has a property value of -0.69596689.
   - ClC1(C2(Cl)C3(Cl)C4(Cl)C5(Cl)C1(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)C5(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)C24Cl has a property value of -0.74885587.

3. The presence of a pyridine ring (a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring) does not significantly alter the trend towards negative values, as seen in other aromatic compounds.

Considering these observations, the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is expected to have a negative property value due to its chlorinated aromatic nature and the presence of a trichloromethyl group.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl would be approximately -0.35.

Given these examples, the property values for alcohols with similar structures tend to be positive and in the range of approximately 0.24 to 0.71. Considering the structure of CCCCC(C)O, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be within this range.

The molecule in question is a chlorinated biphenyl, similar to the example Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 0.82938933. The given molecule has a similar structure but with fewer chlorine atoms.

Considering the pattern from the examples, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms tends to increase the property value, but the exact number and position of chlorine atoms can affect the value. The molecule in question has fewer chlorine atoms than the example with a value of 0.82938933, so we can expect the property value to be somewhat lower.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be slightly lower than 0.82938933. A predicted value could be around 0.5.

True Property: -0.8277262946457763
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a triaryl phosphate ester, which includes:
- Aromatic rings (phenyl groups)
- Phosphate ester linkage

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and ester linkages tend to have property values around the range of -0.5 to -0.9.
- The presence of additional functional groups like nitro, cyano, or halogens can significantly affect the property value, often increasing it.

Given the structure of the molecule, it is similar to other aromatic ester compounds in the examples, which generally have negative property values. However, the presence of multiple aromatic rings and the phosphate group might slightly increase the property value compared to simpler aromatic esters.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around -0.6.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -0.5788014830634552
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule contains a trifluoromethyl group (CF3), an aromatic ring, and a chlorinated piperidine ring with a ketone group.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have a range of property values, often positive but not always.
- The presence of a trifluoromethyl group (CF3) can influence the property value, as seen in some examples with fluorinated groups.
- The presence of a ketone group and chlorinated aliphatic rings can also affect the property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule has structural similarities to some of the examples with positive property values, particularly those with aromatic rings and halogen substituents. However, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and the ketone group might moderate the property value.

Based on these considerations, I would predict a property value that is slightly positive, reflecting the balance of these structural features. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around 0.5.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.2003088276539617
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring, with a nitro group (NO2) also attached to the ring.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.75627357, and Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a property value of 0.95164678. Both of these molecules have strong electron-withdrawing groups.

The methoxy group is an electron-donating group, which might slightly reduce the positive effect of the nitro group compared to a molecule with only electron-withdrawing groups. However, the overall effect of the nitro group is likely to dominate.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to the example with the nitro groups. A reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 0.07816238. The given molecule has more chlorine atoms and a more complex structure, which could potentially increase the property value due to increased molecular weight and potential for interactions.

Considering the trend that more chlorination and complex structures tend to increase the property value, I would predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is slightly higher than 0.07816238.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately 0.15.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.3810828181882704
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with simple alkyl chains, such as CCC#C (-0.44882276) and CCCCC#C (-0.30562373), tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with ester groups, such as CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 (0.06416794) and CCOC(=O)NCCOc2ccc(Oc1ccccc1)cc2 (-0.89707924), have property values that are close to zero or slightly negative.

Given that CCCOC=O is a relatively simple ester with a short alkyl chain, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly negative, similar to other small esters or simple alkyl chains.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O is approximately -0.3.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.7864730396889261
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a long-chain ester, specifically decanoate ester, which is similar to other aliphatic esters and long-chain hydrocarbons in the examples.

Looking at the examples, we see that long-chain hydrocarbons and esters tend to have positive property values. For instance, CCCCC(CC)C=O has a property value of 1.54262791, and CCCC=C(CC)C=O has a property value of 4.64357372. These examples suggest that the presence of a long aliphatic chain and an ester group contributes to a positive property value.

Given the structure of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, which is a decanoate ester, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. Considering the trend in the examples, a value around 1.5 to 4.5 seems plausible. However, since this molecule is a simple ester without additional functional groups that might significantly alter the property, a value closer to the lower end of this range is more likely.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 1.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and functional groups present in the molecule and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have relatively high property values (0.99023874).
- Molecules with phenol groups, such as Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1, have moderate property values (0.23679145).
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, have moderate to high property values (0.67299068).

Considering these observations, the presence of both electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and chloro) and the electron-donating phenol group, the property value is likely to be influenced by the balance of these effects. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which tends to increase the property value, while the phenol group can moderate this effect.

Based on the structural analysis and comparison with similar molecules, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be around 0.8.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them with the examples provided. The molecule contains multiple phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are known to influence the property values significantly.

From the examples, molecules with similar functional groups and aromatic systems tend to have property values that are either slightly positive or negative, depending on the specific arrangement and presence of other functional groups. For instance, the molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of 0.26965954, which suggests that the presence of phosphorothioate groups can contribute to a positive property value.

Considering the structure of the given molecule, which includes two phosphorothioate groups and an aromatic system, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly positive. Therefore, a predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 could be approximately:

True Property: 0.990238741727685
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we have:
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1O, which is a benzamide with a hydroxyl group, has a property value of 1.34078714.
- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which is a nitrobenzene, has a property value of 1.34078714.
- Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, which is a methylphenol, has a property value of 1.39958057.

The presence of both a hydroxyl group and a nitro group on the benzene ring suggests that the property value might be influenced by both the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group and the electron-donating nature of the hydroxyl group. Given the examples, the property values for molecules with similar functional groups are relatively high.

Therefore, based on the structural similarities and the property values of the examples, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is approximately 1.34078714.

True Property: -0.9111433834932643
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and functional groups present in the molecule and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a complex sugar-like structure with multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups and ether linkages, resembling a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide. In the examples provided, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic structures, such as C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, have a property value of -0.34474804.

Given the structural similarity to sugar molecules and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, which tend to lower the property value due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding potential, we can predict that the property value for the given molecule will be in a similar range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O is approximately -0.35.

True Property: -0.44882276337961785
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne. It has a terminal alkyne group (C#C) and a relatively simple structure compared to the more complex aromatic and polycyclic structures in the examples.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Simple aliphatic hydrocarbons like CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO (0.23521791) and CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO (0.3601129) have positive property values.
- Molecules with triple bonds, such as N#Cc1ccccc1C#N (2.02565397), tend to have higher property values, but this is likely influenced by the aromatic ring and the presence of two cyano groups.

Given that CCC#C is a simple aliphatic molecule with a terminal alkyne, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is positive but not as high as those with additional functional groups or aromatic systems.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around 0.2 to 0.4. However, since it is simpler than the long-chain alcohols, a value closer to the lower end of this range is more likely.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCC#C is approximately:

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**:
   - The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in the example molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 0.26965954.
   - It also has a chlorinated aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of -0.30897556 and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of 0.06429327.

2. **Alkyl Chains**:
   - The presence of ethyl groups (CC) is a common feature in several molecules, such as CCC(=O)CC with a property value of 0.69522182.

3. **Overall Structure**:
   - The combination of a phosphorothioate group and a chlorinated aromatic ring suggests a property value that might be influenced by both the electron-withdrawing nature of the chlorines and the presence of the P=S group.

Considering these factors, the property value is likely to be influenced by the electron-withdrawing chlorines, which tend to lower the property value, and the phosphorothioate group, which might increase it slightly. Balancing these effects, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be slightly positive, but close to zero.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately **0.1**.

True Property: 0.296610951585034
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a pyridine derivative with a carbonyl group attached to a hydrazine moiety.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro groups) tend to have higher property values, often positive.
2. Molecules with multiple halogens or highly electronegative atoms tend to have higher property values.
3. Molecules with simple alkyl chains or non-polar groups tend to have lower or negative property values.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 has a pyridine ring, which is aromatic and can contribute to a moderate property value. The carbonyl group (C=O) is an electron-withdrawing group, and the hydrazine moiety (NN) can also influence the property value due to its potential for hydrogen bonding and electron donation.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is not extremely high or low, but rather moderate. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be around 0.3.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, have a property value of 0.70019507.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, have a property value of 5.12997739.
- Molecules with piperidine rings, such as CCN2c1cc(N(C)C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23, have a property value of -0.60336941.

Considering the combination of these features and the overall structure, the molecule is likely to have a property value influenced by the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage, which tend to have positive contributions, but also by the piperidine ring, which might lower the value.

Taking into account these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around 0.5.

Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.3251480413985475
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (octane), we can analyze the trends in the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of functional groups, aromatic rings, and the overall size and shape of the molecule.

In the examples, simple aliphatic hydrocarbons like CCCCCC (hexane) have a property value of -0.32514804, and CCC/C=C/C (a simple alkene) has a value of -0.06569323. The trend suggests that as the carbon chain length increases, the property value becomes less negative or even positive, as seen with CCCCC(C)(C)CO having a value of 2.59025752.

Given that CCCCCCCC is a straight-chain alkane with no functional groups or aromatic rings, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar to that of other simple alkanes, but slightly less negative than hexane due to the increased chain length.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (octane) would be around -0.2.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: -0.9075245305406962
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as the presence of functional groups, the degree of saturation, aromaticity, and steric effects. The given molecule, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, contains several features that can influence its property value:

1. **Cycloalkane Structure**: The molecule has a polycyclic structure with multiple cyclohexane rings, which is similar to some of the examples provided. These structures often contribute to a negative property value due to their non-polar nature and lack of functional groups that would increase polarity.

2. **Carbonyl Group**: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) can increase the polarity of the molecule, potentially leading to a less negative or even positive property value. However, in the context of a large, mostly non-polar structure, its effect might be limited.

3. **Hydroxyl Group**: The presence of an -OH group can also increase polarity and potentially lead to a less negative property value. However, its impact will depend on its position and the overall molecular context.

4. **Alkyne Group**: The presence of a C#C (alkyne) group introduces some degree of unsaturation, which can affect the property value, but its impact is generally less significant compared to polar functional groups.

Considering these factors and comparing with the examples provided, the molecule's structure is somewhat similar to other polycyclic compounds with carbonyl and hydroxyl groups, which tend to have negative property values. Therefore, I would predict a negative property value for this molecule.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C would be approximately -0.85.

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups. Based on the examples provided, molecules with complex polycyclic structures and multiple oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21 has a property value of -0.98480596, and it shares some structural complexity with the given molecule.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen atoms, which can contribute to a more negative property value, I would predict that the property value for the given molecule is likely to be negative and possibly in the range of -0.5 to -1.0.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately:

- Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (another nitrophenol) has a property value of 1.34078714.
- Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) has a property value of 0.80992282.
- Clc1ccccc1I (iodochlorobenzene) has a property value of 1.25968537.

The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) and a chlorine atom (Cl) on a benzene ring suggests that the property value might be influenced by both the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine and the electron-donating effect of the hydroxyl group. The examples with halogenated benzene rings and phenols suggest that the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl might be in a similar range.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around 1.0. Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is approximately:

True Property: -0.49009192601049245
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 contains:
- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C)
- An ester linkage (OC(=O))
- An amide linkage (NC(=O))
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens (e.g., Cl, F) tend to have property values around 0.2 to 0.8.
- The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) in amides and esters can lead to negative property values, as seen in several examples.
- The presence of multiple halogens, especially chlorine, can lead to positive property values, but this is not always the case.

Considering these factors, the molecule has both electron-withdrawing groups (carbonyls, chlorines) and an aromatic system, which can balance each other out. The presence of the alkyne and ester groups might slightly shift the property value towards the negative side, but the overall structure suggests a value that is not too extreme.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around -0.1 to 0.3. Given the examples, a specific prediction could be:

The molecule in question has:
- A hydroxyl group (OH) attached to a carbon that is also connected to three aromatic rings.
- Two of these rings are chlorinated phenyl rings, and one is a pyrimidine ring.

From the examples:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substitutions, such as Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (1.02070765) and Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (0.8493949), tend to have positive property values.
- Molecules with heterocyclic aromatic rings, such as Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2 (0.23679145), also show positive values.
- The presence of a hydroxyl group in Oc1ccc(O)cc1 (0.8493949) contributes to a positive value.

Considering these factors, the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl is likely to have a positive property value due to the combination of aromatic rings, halogen substitutions, and the hydroxyl group.

Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.8.

True Property: -0.28392149181994053
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCCCOC=O is an ester, specifically a linear alkyl ester, similar to the example molecule CCCCCCC=O, which has a property value of -0.28392149. 

The structure of CCCCCOC=O is similar to CCCCCCC=O, but with an additional oxygen atom in the ester linkage. Esters generally have similar properties to ketones and aldehydes, but the presence of the ester linkage can slightly alter the property value. 

Considering the examples, the property values for linear aliphatic compounds with similar functional groups tend to be slightly negative. Given the similarity to CCCCCCC=O and the presence of the ester group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be slightly more negative than -0.28392149, due to the additional oxygen atom in the ester linkage.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCCCOC=O could be approximately -0.35.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ester group (COOC) attached to a benzene ring. In the examples, we have several molecules with aromatic rings and ester groups:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2, with a property value of -0.46797267. This molecule is more complex due to additional functional groups like sulfonamide and a heterocyclic ring, which likely contribute to a more negative property value.

2. CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, with a property value of -0.06336204. This molecule is a diketone with two carbonyl groups attached to a benzene ring, which is somewhat similar in terms of aromaticity and carbonyl presence.

3. CCCCC(=O)OCC, with a property value of 0.95706498. This is a simple ester with a longer alkyl chain, which contributes to a positive property value.

Considering the structure of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, it is less complex than the first example and more similar to the second and third examples in terms of having an ester group and an aromatic ring. The presence of the ester group and the benzene ring suggests a property value that is likely closer to neutral or slightly positive, similar to the third example.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around 0.5.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.3251480413985475
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached to the end. In the examples, linear alkyl chains without additional functional groups tend to have property values around zero or slightly negative. For instance, CCCCCCCCO has a property value of -0.32514804, and CCCCCCC=C has a property value of -0.19428149.

The presence of a bromine atom, which is a halogen, might slightly affect the property value. In the example Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, the presence of bromine in an aromatic system results in a property value of 0.23679145. However, in a linear alkyl chain, the effect might be less pronounced.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be slightly negative or close to zero, similar to other linear alkyl chains. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around -0.2.

SMILES: CO
True Property: -1.0198035720078964
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide), we can analyze the examples provided. The examples include a variety of organic and inorganic compounds with different functional groups and structural features. The property values range from highly negative to highly positive, indicating a diverse set of properties.

Carbon monoxide is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is a small, non-polar molecule with a relatively high bond order. In the context of the examples, smaller and simpler molecules like CCC (propane) and CCBr (bromoethane) have negative property values, while more complex or highly substituted molecules tend to have positive values.

Given the simplicity and small size of CO, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is negative, similar to other small molecules in the examples. However, CO is also unique due to its strong triple bond and potential for coordination chemistry, which might influence its property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO would be around -0.5, aligning it with other small, simple molecules in the dataset.
