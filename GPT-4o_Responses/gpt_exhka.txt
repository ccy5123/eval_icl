True Property: -0.2693211097287046
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxygen and a nitrogen atom. This structure is similar to some of the other aromatic and heterocyclic compounds in the examples, particularly those with chlorine substituents and heteroatoms.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with chlorine substituents, such as Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, tend to have higher property values.
- Heterocyclic compounds with oxygen and nitrogen, such as COc2c1occc1c(OC)c3c(=O)cc(C)oc23, have lower property values.

Considering these observations, the presence of chlorine and the heterocyclic structure with an oxygen and nitrogen atom suggest a property value that is not extremely high or low, but rather moderate. The closest example in terms of structure might be a combination of the effects seen in chlorinated aromatics and heterocyclic compounds.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around 0.0, as it balances the effects of the chlorine substituent and the heterocyclic structure.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, ring structures, and the overall size and shape of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear chain with five carbon atoms and a sulfur atom at the end. This structure is similar to the linear alkanes and alkenes in the examples, such as CCCCCCC=C (0.94068764) and CCCCCCC(C)C (1.50328858). These examples suggest that linear hydrocarbons tend to have positive property values, likely due to their non-polar nature and lack of complex functional groups.

Considering the presence of sulfur, which is less electronegative than oxygen and can introduce some polarity but not as much as oxygen-containing groups, the property value might be slightly lower than that of a similar hydrocarbon without sulfur. However, it is still expected to be positive.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic imide, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -0.54450537. The main difference in the new molecule is the presence of a longer alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) attached to the cyclic imide structure.

The addition of an alkyl chain generally increases the hydrophobicity of the molecule, which can affect the property value. However, the core structure remains similar to the example provided, and the change is not expected to drastically alter the property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is likely to be slightly more negative than -0.54450537 due to the increased hydrophobicity, but not significantly different. Therefore, a reasonable prediction would be around -0.55.

True Property: -0.8818666498830983
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several molecules with negative property values.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which is also present in molecules with negative property values.
- An alkene group (C=C) and an amine group (CCN), which are not directly indicative of a positive or negative property value but are present in various examples.

Based on the examples, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group further supports this trend. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for this molecule.

Considering the examples with similar features, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around -0.8. Thus, the predicted property value is:

-0.80000000

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.484796331322129
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. 

From the examples, we can observe that simple esters like CC(C)CCOC=O (0.48479633) and CCCCOC(=O)C (0.48479633) have similar property values. These examples suggest that simple esters tend to have property values around 0.48479633.

Therefore, based on the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O is approximately 0.48479633.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.06008285149656904
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is structurally similar to c1ccccc1O (phenol), which has a property value of -0.06008285. The presence of additional methyl groups in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 could slightly alter the property value, but given the examples, the effect of methyl groups on aromatic rings tends to be relatively small.

Therefore, based on the examples and the structural similarity to phenol, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be close to that of phenol. A slight adjustment for the methyl groups might be considered, but it is likely to remain in the same range.

Predicted property value: -0.06008285

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 1.3610403293342181
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)O), which is similar to the phosphorothioate groups in the examples COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl. These examples have property values of 3.68536671, 4.94800786, and 2.90523321, respectively. The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) in these examples contributes to their relatively high property values.

The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) attached to the aromatic ring, instead of halogens. The absence of halogens and the presence of a thiomethyl group suggest that the property value might be lower than those of the halogenated examples.

Considering the structural similarities and differences, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 would be around 2.0. This value reflects the influence of the phosphorothioate group while accounting for the absence of halogens and the presence of a thiomethyl group.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values. For instance, ClC(Cl)Cl has a property value of 4.78042244, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1.98130926. 

The molecule in question, Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, has a similar structure to Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, but with a slightly different arrangement of chlorine atoms. Given the pattern observed, the property value is likely to be in a similar range to these examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be approximately 1.98130926.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.384253091872139
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group attached to the terminal nitrogen. The presence of the nitro group (N(=O)=O) is a key factor in determining the property value, as it is a strong electron-withdrawing group.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative property values, indicating that the nitro group contributes to a decrease in the property value. For instance, the molecule CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.82190915, and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.86713258.

Considering the simplicity of the molecule CCCN(=O)=O compared to the more complex structures with multiple nitro groups, we can expect the property value to be less negative than those examples but still negative due to the presence of the nitro group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around -0.5.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.7409440640273717
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, which can be compared to similar structures in the examples.

1. **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** has a property value of 1.47902185. This molecule is a chlorobenzene with a bromine substituent.
2. **c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12** has a property value of 0.10795641. This is a biphenyl structure with a bromine substituent.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but with a fluorine atom instead of a chlorine atom. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which might affect the property value. However, the presence of bromine, which is a heavier halogen, might dominate the property value.

Considering these factors, the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is likely to be close to that of Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but slightly lower due to the presence of fluorine instead of chlorine. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be around 1.3.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 1.4075708577080217
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with an additional methyl group and a hydroxyl group. This structure is similar to some of the cyclic and bicyclic compounds in the examples, particularly those with tertiary alcohols.

From the examples, we see that molecules with tertiary alcohols, such as CCCC(C)(C)O and CC(C)(C)CO, have a property value of 1.40757086. These molecules are aliphatic and contain tertiary alcohols, similar to the target molecule.

Given this similarity, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 will also be close to 1.40757086. Therefore, the predicted property value for this molecule is:

1.40757086

True Property: -0.14410619459541996
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)
- An amide linkage (N2C(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)

Comparing this structure to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 0.64036336, we notice that both molecules share the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage to a phenyl ring. The main difference is the presence of a thioether (SC(CCl)) in the example, which is not present in the molecule we are predicting.

Given the structural similarities and the absence of the thioether group, which might slightly affect the property value, we can predict that the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O will be close to, but slightly lower than, 0.64036336.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is approximately 0.60.

To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzamide-like structure with a phenyl group attached to a nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of -0.82959549. Both molecules contain aromatic rings and a carbonyl group attached to a nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring, suggesting they might have similar electronic properties.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of aromatic rings and a carbonyl group in a heterocyclic context, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C will be in a similar range to the example mentioned.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is approximately -0.8.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which is a linear chain with a total of 9 carbon atoms.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCCCC(=O)OC (octyl acetate) with a property value of 0.48479633.
- CCCCCCCCI (iodoheptane) with a property value of 4.05772219.
- CCCCC (pentane) with a property value of 1.50328858.
- CCCCCC (hexane) with a property value of 1.50328858.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar to CCCCCCC(=O)OC, but with an additional ethyl group instead of a methyl group. The presence of the ester functional group and the length of the carbon chain suggest that the property value will be similar to that of CCCCCCC(=O)OC.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 0.48479633.

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.33642650190913415
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is methyl benzoate, which consists of a benzene ring with a methoxycarbonyl group attached.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 with a property value of -0.46676087. This molecule is ethyl salicylate, which has a similar ester functional group attached to a benzene ring, but with an additional hydroxyl group.
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 with a property value of -0.3364265. This molecule is ethyl benzoate, which is very similar to methyl benzoate, differing only by the length of the alkyl chain in the ester group.

Given that methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1) is structurally very similar to ethyl benzoate (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1), we can expect the property value to be close to that of ethyl benzoate. The difference in the alkyl chain length (methyl vs. ethyl) might cause a slight variation, but it is reasonable to predict a similar property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.3364265.

True Property: 0.4997054635791074
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear conjugated diene, which is similar in structure to some of the simpler hydrocarbons in the examples.

Looking at the examples, we see that simple hydrocarbons and alkenes tend to have positive property values. For instance, CC/C=C/C has a property value of 0.94068764, and CCC(C)(C)CC has a property value of 1.50328858. These examples suggest that hydrocarbons with double bonds or branched structures tend to have positive property values.

Given that C=CCC=C is a simple linear diene, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value, likely in the range of the simpler hydrocarbons provided. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C would be around 0.9, similar to the value for CC/C=C/C.

True Property: 8.929683163824118
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular size and complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br, also known as tribromomethane or bromoform, is a small, simple molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly bromine, tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br has a property value of 3.2985052, which is relatively high, likely due to the presence of multiple halogens.

Given that BrC(Br)Br is a small molecule with three bromine atoms, we can expect its property value to be relatively high, similar to other halogenated compounds. However, it is likely to be lower than the value for FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br due to the absence of fluorine and the smaller size of the molecule.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around 2.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 1.27055426.
- A thioester linkage (SC(CCl)), which is not directly present in the examples but can be related to sulfur-containing groups.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is present in several examples with positive property values, such as ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl (4.94800786) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (2.61609206).
- An imide group (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O), which is similar to the structure in CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O (-0.13511626).

Considering these features, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the chlorinated carbon suggests a positive contribution to the property value. The imide group might contribute a slightly negative or neutral effect based on the examples.

Balancing these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is likely to be positive, but not as high as the most chlorinated examples. A reasonable estimate would be around 1.1.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule contains several functional groups and structural elements that can influence its property value:

1. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: This is a common feature in several molecules with negative property values, such as NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1 (-0.16183538) and CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C (-0.18781405).

2. **Chlorine Substituent (Cl)**: Chlorine atoms often contribute to higher property values, as seen in ClCCCCl (3.38167798) and ClC(Cl)(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (12.18411511). However, in aromatic systems, they can also be associated with negative values, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-0.16183538).

3. **Aromatic Ring with Nitrogen and Oxygen Heteroatoms**: The presence of heteroatoms in aromatic rings, such as in Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2 (-0.57971713) and O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-0.69202984), often correlates with negative property values.

4. **Tert-butyl Group (C(C)(C)C)**: This bulky group can influence the property value, but its effect is context-dependent. In the example CC=C(C)C (0.94068764), it contributes to a positive value, but the overall molecular context here is different.

Considering these factors, the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C has structural features that suggest a negative property value, primarily due to the amide linkage, the aromatic ring with heteroatoms, and the presence of a chlorine substituent in an aromatic context.

Based on the analysis of similar structures and their property values, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.3 to -0.5. Given the examples, a specific predicted value could be:

**-0.412**

True Property: -0.16183537900079706
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which can be broken down into two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with chlorine atoms attached to each ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, which has a property value of 1.98130926. However, the example molecule has more chlorine atoms, which generally increase the property value due to their electron-withdrawing nature.

Another relevant example is Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a property value of 0.68994708. This molecule has two chlorine atoms on a single phenyl ring, similar to each individual ring in the target molecule.

Considering the structure of the target molecule, which has three chlorine atoms distributed across two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, the property value is likely to be influenced by the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine atoms and the ether linkage.

Based on these comparisons, the predicted property value for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is likely to be slightly higher than 0.68994708 due to the additional chlorine atom and the ether linkage, but not as high as 1.98130926 due to fewer chlorine atoms overall.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is approximately 0.8.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC/C=C\C, we can analyze the examples provided and look for patterns or similarities. The molecule CC/C=C\C is a linear alkene with four carbon atoms, similar to the example CC/C=C/C, which has a property value of 0.94068764. Both molecules are simple alkenes with similar structures, differing only in the position of the double bond.

Given this similarity, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC/C=C\C will be very close to that of CC/C=C/C. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C is approximately 0.94068764.

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 1.4075708577080217
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCOCC is a linear chain with an ether functional group (R-O-R').

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Simple alkanes like C (methane) and C1CCCCCC1 (cyclohexane) have relatively high property values (1.50328858).
- Molecules with alcohol groups like CCC(O)CC have a property value of 1.40757086.
- Molecules with ether groups, such as CCOC(=O)C (an ester, but with an ether linkage), have a property value of 0.48479633.

The molecule CCCOCC is an ether, similar to the ether linkage in CCOC(=O)C, but without the carbonyl group. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CCCOCC would be somewhat similar to that of CCOC(=O)C, but potentially slightly higher due to the absence of the carbonyl group, which might lower the property value.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

This molecule is a tertiary amide with two phenyl rings and a tert-butyl group. The presence of aromatic rings and the amide functional group suggests that the property value might be negative, as seen in similar structures in the examples.

Comparing it to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of -0.8244953, we notice that both molecules have two phenyl rings and an amide group. However, the example molecule has an additional heterocyclic ring, which might contribute to a more negative value.

Another similar example is Nc1cccc2ccccc12, with a property value of -0.46080774. This molecule has two aromatic rings but lacks the amide group, which might make it less negative than the target molecule.

Considering these comparisons, the predicted property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be negative and possibly between -0.5 and -0.8. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.6. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is:

True Property: 0.09670001547556938
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-), which is a polar functional group.
- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1), which is a benzene ring with a bromine substituent.

From the examples:
- Molecules with acetamide or similar polar groups tend to have negative property values, indicating a tendency towards lower hydrophobicity or higher polarity.
- Molecules with bromobenzene or similar aromatic halogenated structures have varying property values, but the presence of bromine often increases the property value due to its size and polarizability.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative due to the polar acetamide group, but not as negative as molecules with multiple polar groups or nitro groups.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around -0.1.

True Property: 0.15405143729074275
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is isopropylbenzene, also known as cumene. 

Looking at the examples, we have:
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 with a property value of 0.15405144
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 with a property value of 0.15405144

Both of these examples are similar in structure to cumene, as they contain alkyl-substituted benzene rings. The presence of the isopropyl group in cumene is similar to the structures of these examples, which also have alkyl groups attached to benzene rings.

Given the similarity in structure, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 (cumene) will be similar to the property values of the examples with alkyl-substituted benzene rings. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is approximately 0.15405144.

True Property: -0.17923548440253834
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings, such as benzene derivatives, tend to have negative property values. For instance:
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1O has a property value of -0.46676087.
- COc1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.06008285.
- O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.69202984.

Considering the presence of the carbonyl group (C=O) in benzaldehyde, which is an electron-withdrawing group, it is likely to further decrease the property value compared to a simple benzene ring.

Based on these observations, I would predict that the property value for O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) is likely to be negative and similar to other benzene derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around -0.3 to -0.5.

Therefore, a specific predicted property value for O=Cc1ccccc1 could be approximately -0.4.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with negative property values.
- An oxazole ring, which is a heterocyclic aromatic structure.
- Amide groups (C=O)N, which are also present in several examples with negative property values.

Based on the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings, such as Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 and COc2ccc(Oc1ccc(NC(=O)N(C)C)cc1)cc2, have negative property values.
- The presence of heterocyclic aromatic structures and amide groups also tends to correlate with negative property values.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, where two phenyl rings are connected by a hydrazine (N-N) linkage.

From the examples, we have:

- Nc1ccccc1, which is an aniline, has a property value of -0.06008285.
- N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which is an azobenzene, has a property value of -0.68432795.

The molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally similar to these examples, particularly the azobenzene, but with a hydrazine linkage instead of an azo linkage. The hydrazine linkage is less electron-withdrawing than the azo linkage, which might result in a less negative property value compared to the azobenzene.

Considering these factors, the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be between the values for aniline and azobenzene. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.3.

In the examples, similar cyclic structures with amide groups, such as O=C1N(COC(=O)CC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3, have negative property values. The diketopiperazine structure is also similar to O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, which has a property value of -0.39150679.

Considering the structural similarities and the trend of negative property values for cyclic amide-containing compounds, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be negative and close to the values of similar structures.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately -0.4.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) with a property value of -0.06008285
- CCc1ccccn1 (ethylpyridine) with a property value of 0.07450112
- CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 (octylbenzene) with a property value of 0.15405144

The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is similar to these in that it is an alkyl-substituted aromatic compound. The property values for these types of compounds are generally small and positive, reflecting their hydrophobic nature and moderate size.

Given the structure of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, which is diethylbenzene, it is likely to have a property value close to that of ethylpyridine (0.07450112) and octylbenzene (0.15405144), but slightly higher than ethylpyridine due to the additional ethyl group increasing hydrophobicity and molecular size.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is a para-substituted aniline with a sulfonamide group. The presence of the nitro group in the examples often leads to negative property values, likely due to electron-withdrawing effects and increased polarity. The sulfonamide group is also electron-withdrawing and polar, similar to nitro groups, which suggests that the property value might be negative.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups on aromatic rings, such as Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, have property values around -0.5069072. Given the structural similarity, the presence of an electron-withdrawing group, and the aromatic nature of the compound, a similar negative property value can be expected.

- An amide group (NC(C)=O) similar to the example CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -0.09830238.
- A thioester linkage (SC) which is not directly represented in the examples but is a sulfur-containing functional group.

Considering the presence of the phosphoric acid ester group, which tends to increase the property value, and the amide group, which tends to decrease it, we can estimate the property value by balancing these influences.

The example with a similar phosphoric acid ester group (COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl) has a property value of 1.67967259, which is lower than the one with the aromatic chlorinated ring. The presence of the thioester linkage might slightly increase the property value due to the sulfur atom.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around 1.5.

1. An ester linkage (OC(=O)).
2. A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1).
3. An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23).
4. A pyridine-like structure (ccnc).
5. A chlorine substituent on an aromatic ring.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with ester linkages, such as CCCOCC(=O)CC, tend to have property values around 0.48479633.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2, tend to have negative property values, like -0.51243049.
- Aromatic rings with chlorine substituents, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1, tend to have positive property values, like 2.15941974.
- Complex aromatic systems with multiple rings and heteroatoms, such as c1cc2ccc3cccc4ccc(c1)c2c34, tend to have negative property values, like -0.72844729.

Considering these observations, the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 has a combination of features that suggest a negative property value. The presence of the amide linkage and the complex aromatic system with a chlorine substituent likely contribute to a negative value, similar to other complex aromatic systems with heteroatoms.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 1.4075708577080217
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the trends and patterns from the given examples. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol with a five-carbon chain and an alcohol group at the end. 

From the examples, we observe that:
- Linear alkanes and alcohols tend to have positive property values. For instance, OC1CCCCCCC1 has a property value of 1.40757086, and CCCCCC has a property value of 0.81120822.
- The presence of an alcohol group (OH) generally increases the property value compared to the corresponding alkane.

Given these observations, CCCCCO, being a linear alcohol similar to OC1CCCCCCC1 but with a shorter chain, is expected to have a positive property value. Considering the trend, the property value for CCCCCO is likely to be slightly lower than that of OC1CCCCCCC1 due to the shorter carbon chain.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO is approximately 1.40757086, similar to OC1CCCCCCC1, but slightly lower due to the shorter chain. A specific predicted value could be around 1.2 to 1.3.

True Property: -0.626178166814043
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is often associated with polar and electron-withdrawing characteristics.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is also polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which is common in many of the examples and can contribute to stability and specific interactions.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can also contribute to polarity.

From the examples, molecules with polar groups and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values, especially when they contain multiple electron-withdrawing groups. For instance, molecules with nitro groups or multiple halogens often have high positive values, while those with amides and sulfonyl groups tend to have negative values.

Given the presence of both an amide and a sulfonyl group, along with an aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be negative. Comparing with similar structures in the examples, such as those with amide and sulfonyl groups, a reasonable prediction would be a moderately negative value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is approximately -0.5.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several functional groups and structural features that can influence its property value:

1. **Ester Groups (COC(=O))**: Esters are present in the molecule, which can contribute to a more positive property value, as seen in some examples like CCCCCC(=O)OC.

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The presence of a nitro group is often associated with a more negative property value, as seen in examples like CCCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O.

3. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: Aromatic rings are common in many of the examples and can have varying effects depending on the substituents attached to them.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring with Nitrogen (C1=C(C)NC)**: The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle can also influence the property value, often contributing to a more negative value.

Considering these factors and comparing with the examples, the molecule has both electron-withdrawing groups (like the nitro group) and electron-donating groups (like the ester), which can balance each other out to some extent. However, the presence of the nitro group and the nitrogen-containing heterocycle suggests a tendency towards a more negative property value.

Based on these observations and the trends in the examples, I would predict the property value for the given molecule to be approximately:

These examples suggest that the presence of carbonyl groups and nitrogen in a cyclic structure tends to result in a negative property value.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be negative. Based on the trends from the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.3. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is:

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure, consisting of a chloroethane (ethyl chloride) group. In the examples, small and relatively simple molecules like CCC (propane) and CC#N (acetonitrile) have property values around 0.5. Additionally, the presence of a chlorine atom in a simple aromatic compound like Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) results in a property value of 0.5452801.

This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with chlorinated aromatic rings and trichloromethyl groups.

For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.26430298, and it features a dichlorobenzene structure. The presence of additional chlorine atoms, especially in the trichloromethyl group, tends to increase the property value, as seen in the example ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O with a value of 2.65106083.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of the trichloromethyl group, the property value for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is likely to be higher than 0.26430298 but lower than 2.65106083. A reasonable prediction, taking into account the increased chlorination, would be around 1.24845759, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl.

   - ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl (carbon tetrachloride) has a property value of 6.61579027.
   - CI (iodomethane) has a property value of 4.05772219.

2. The presence of multiple halogen atoms, especially heavier halogens like bromine and iodine, tends to increase the property value.

Given that 1,4-dibromobenzene is similar in nature to these halogenated compounds and considering the trend of increasing property values with heavier halogens, we can predict that the property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 will be positive and likely higher than those of compounds with lighter halogens.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 (1,4-dibromobenzene) would be around 5.0, considering the trends observed in the examples.

Given the structure:
- The molecule has three aromatic rings, which are generally associated with negative property values in the examples.
- The phosphate group is a polar, electron-withdrawing group, which can also contribute to a negative property value.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.5.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, particularly those with halogens and aromatic rings, the molecule is likely to have a positive property value. The presence of the CF3 group and multiple chlorine atoms suggests a higher property value.

Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O would be around 1.5.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.5069071970589536
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring, with a nitro group (NO2) also attached to the ring.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, tend to have negative property values. The example given has a property value of -0.69202984.
- Aromatic compounds with methoxy groups, such as c1ccccc1O, have a property value of -0.06008285.

Considering the combination of both a methoxy group and a nitro group on the benzene ring, the property value is likely to be negative, influenced more by the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around -0.5. However, given the specific examples, a more precise prediction would be slightly more negative than -0.06008285 but less negative than -0.69202984. Therefore, a predicted property value could be approximately -0.4.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated compound, similar to ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 12.18411511. The given molecule has a similar level of chlorination and complexity, suggesting that it will also have a high property value.

Considering the pattern from the examples, the property value is likely to be influenced by the number of chlorine atoms and the overall molecular structure. Given the high degree of chlorination and the structural similarity to the example with a high property value, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl will also be very high.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is approximately 12.18411511.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with simple alkyl chains, such as CCC#C and CCCCC#C, have positive property values (0.6241427).
- Molecules with functional groups like esters, amides, and nitro groups tend to have negative property values, such as COC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 (-0.46676087) and CNC(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc12 (-0.57482714).

Given that CCCOC=O is an ester, it is likely to have a negative property value. The closest example in terms of functional group is COC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, which has a property value of -0.46676087. However, CCCOC=O is a simpler molecule without additional aromatic or nitro groups, which might make its property value less negative.

These examples suggest that aliphatic esters and alcohols generally have positive property values.

Given the structure of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, which is a decanoate ester, it is reasonable to predict that it will also have a positive property value. Considering the trend in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around 1.0 to 1.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 1.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O), which is often associated with negative property values in the examples.
- Two chlorine atoms, which can contribute to a higher property value, but in the context of aromatic rings and nitro groups, they often lead to negative values.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is present in several examples with negative property values.
- Aromatic rings, which are common in the examples and often associated with negative property values when combined with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro and chloro.

Considering these features and comparing them with similar structures in the examples, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (-0.16183538) and Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl (-0.16183538), the presence of the nitro group and the overall electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents suggest a negative property value.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings, sulfur, and phosphorus atoms, as well as ester and ether linkages.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with aromatic rings and halogens tend to have positive property values, while those with more polar functional groups like carbonyls, nitro groups, or sulfonamides often have negative values. The presence of sulfur and phosphorus, especially in the form of phosphorothioate groups, can also influence the property value.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple aromatic rings and phosphorothioate groups, the property value is likely to be influenced by these features. The examples with similar complexity and functional groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, have a positive property value of 1.27055426.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 is likely to be positive, and a reasonable estimate would be around 1.2.

True Property: -0.5069071970589536
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can identify similar structures:
- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.38484537. This is a nitrotoluene, which is similar in that it has a nitro group attached to a benzene ring.
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of 1.24845759. This is a chlorinated phenol, which has a hydroxyl group and chlorine atoms attached to a benzene ring.

The presence of the nitro group, which is electron-withdrawing, typically results in a more negative property value compared to structures without such groups. The phenol group can also influence the property value, but the nitro group's effect is more pronounced.

Considering these factors and the examples, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is likely to be similar to that of nitrotoluene, but slightly more negative due to the additional electron-withdrawing effect of the hydroxyl group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.45.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a sugar-like structure with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, which is similar to carbohydrates.

From the examples, we can see that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, have a property value of 1.05863226. This suggests that the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups contributes positively to the property value.

The given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, is a complex sugar with several hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, which should contribute to a positive property value similar to other sugar-like structures.

Considering the structural similarity to the example with a property value of 1.05863226, and the increased complexity and number of hydroxyl groups, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be slightly higher than 1.05863226.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately 1.2.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.6241427040820582
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne, with a terminal triple bond.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with simple alkane or alkene structures, such as CCCCC(O)CCC and CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO, tend to have positive property values.
- Molecules with more complex or aromatic structures, especially those with multiple functional groups or heteroatoms, often have negative property values.

Given that CCC#C is a relatively simple alkyne without additional functional groups or aromatic rings, it is likely to have a positive property value, similar to the simpler alkanes and alkenes in the examples.

Therefore, I predict that the property value for CCC#C is approximately 0.81120822, similar to other simple hydrocarbons like CCCC(=O)C and CCCCCCC=O.

1. **Presence of Chlorine (Cl) atoms**: The molecule contains three chlorine atoms attached to an aromatic ring. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, especially on aromatic rings, tend to have higher property values. For instance, Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 1.73222924, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1.98130926.

2. **Phosphorothioate group (P=S)**: The presence of a phosphorothioate group (P=S) is similar to the molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 1.27055426. This suggests that the P=S group contributes positively to the property value.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is a pyridine derivative with a carbonyl group (C=O) and a hydrazine moiety (NN) attached to the pyridine ring. Let's consider the following aspects:

1. **Aromatic Ring**: The presence of an aromatic ring, such as pyridine, is common in several examples. Pyridine itself is similar to benzene but with a nitrogen atom, which can influence the electronic properties.

2. **Carbonyl Group**: The carbonyl group (C=O) is a polar functional group that can affect the molecule's overall polarity and electronic distribution.

3. **Hydrazine Moiety (NN)**: The presence of the hydrazine group can introduce additional polarity and potential hydrogen bonding interactions.

4. **Comparison with Examples**: 
   - Molecules with aromatic rings and polar functional groups, such as carbonyls or nitro groups, tend to have negative property values in the examples.
   - For instance, Nc1cccc2ccccc12 has a property value of -0.46080774, and Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.5069072. Both contain nitrogen and polar groups.

Considering these factors, the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of the pyridine ring and the polar carbonyl and hydrazine groups. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is approximately -0.5.

True Property: 2.65106083224943
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with sulfur-containing groups (e.g., CCS, CCBr) tend to have higher property values.
- Molecules with amide linkages (e.g., CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C) have moderate property values.
- Molecules with aromatic rings and nitro groups tend to have negative property values.

The presence of the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage suggests a moderate to slightly positive property value. The lack of aromatic rings and nitro groups, which often contribute to negative values, supports this.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around 0.2 to 0.5. Given the examples, a specific prediction could be:

0.314

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 1.5032885794935091
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCCCC is a linear alkane, specifically octane. In the examples, similar linear alkanes such as CCCCCC (hexane) and CCCCCCCCO (octanol) have property values of 1.40757086. 

Given that octane is a longer chain alkane than hexane, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar or slightly higher due to increased hydrophobicity and molecular size. However, since the property values for similar alkanes are consistent, we can predict that the property value for CCCCCCCC will be approximately the same as that for hexane.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCC is 1.40757086.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbon-carbon triple bond (C#C). It resembles some of the polycyclic structures in the examples, such as:

- CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 0.34314092.
- CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO, which has a property value of -0.37812126.

Both of these examples have polycyclic structures with ketone groups (C=O) and hydroxyl groups (O), similar to the molecule in question. The presence of the carbon-carbon triple bond (C#C) in the target molecule might influence the property value, but the overall structure and functional groups suggest a property value in a similar range to the examples.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is likely to be around -0.37812126, as it shares more structural similarity with the second example, which also has a hydroxyl group and a ketone group. Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately -0.378.

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings. Based on the examples provided, molecules with complex polycyclic structures and multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (such as ethers and esters) tend to have negative property values. For instance, molecules like "Cn2c(=O)n(C)c1ncn(CC(O)CO)c1c2=O" and "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)c1ccccc1" have negative property values.

Considering the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen atoms, which often contribute to a more negative property value, I would predict that the property value for this molecule is likely to be negative. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value could be around -0.8 to -1.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the given molecule is approximately:

True Property: 0.2643029840185254
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to phenol (Oc1ccccc1) with an additional chlorine atom. In the examples, phenol derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (N(=O)=O) tend to have negative property values, while halogenated compounds like chlorobenzene (Clc1ccccc1) have positive property values.

Given the presence of both a hydroxyl group (which can be electron-donating) and a chlorine atom (which is electron-withdrawing), the property value is likely to be influenced by these opposing effects. In the examples, chlorobenzene (Clc1ccccc1) has a property value of 2.15941974, while phenol derivatives with electron-withdrawing groups have negative values.

Considering the balance between the electron-donating hydroxyl group and the electron-withdrawing chlorine atom, the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is likely to be slightly positive, but less than that of chlorobenzene due to the presence of the hydroxyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl is approximately 0.5.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with halogens, especially multiple chlorines, tend to have higher property values.
- Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl) tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) in amides and esters often contributes to negative property values.

Considering these factors, the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 has features that suggest a negative property value, similar to other chlorinated aromatic compounds with carbonyl groups.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around -0.4 to -0.6. Given the specific examples, a more precise prediction would be:

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2) attached to the central carbon.
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have negative property values, often in the range of -0.3 to -0.6.
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like chlorine tends to decrease the property value.
- The presence of heterocycles like pyrimidine also tends to result in negative property values.

Considering these observations, the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl has multiple aromatic rings, halogen substituents, and a heterocycle, which suggests a negative property value. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.5.

The molecule CCCCCOC=O is an ester, similar to the example molecule CCCCC(=O)OCC, which has a property value of 0.48479633. Both molecules contain a similar ester functional group and a comparable carbon chain length.

Given this similarity, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CCCCCOC=O will be close to that of CCCCC(=O)OCC. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCOC=O is approximately 0.48479633.

To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we can look at the example provided for a similar molecule, ClCCCl, which has a property value of 3.38167798. The molecule ClCCl is a simpler structure, being dichloromethane, compared to ClCCCl, which is 1,2-dichloroethane. Given the trend that adding more carbon atoms tends to increase the property value, we can infer that ClCCl will have a slightly lower property value than ClCCCl.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be slightly less than 3.38167798. A specific predicted value could be around 3.0.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- Oc1cccc(O)c1 with a property value of -0.23763153, which is a dihydroxybenzene (hydroquinone).
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O with a property value of -0.06008285, which is a methylated phenol similar to p-cresol but with an additional methyl group.

The structure of Cc1cccc(C)c1O is closer to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, but without the additional methyl group. Given that the presence of additional alkyl groups tends to increase the property value slightly, we can infer that the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be slightly lower than -0.06008285.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be approximately -0.1.

The given molecule has four chlorine atoms, two on each phenyl ring, which is similar to the example with five chlorine atoms. The presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the property value due to their electronegativity and size, which can affect the molecular interactions and properties.

Considering the structural similarity and the number of chlorine atoms, the predicted property value for "Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl" would be close to the example with five chlorines, but slightly lower due to having one less chlorine atom. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 1.98130926, slightly adjusted for the difference in chlorine content.

The presence of a double bond and the overall non-polar nature of the molecule suggest that it will have a positive property value.

Given the examples, particularly the positive values for hydrocarbons and the presence of a double bond, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around 0.8, similar to other small hydrocarbons with double bonds.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC=C(C)C is approximately 0.8.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 3.381677975584457
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we can analyze the given examples and their associated property values. The examples with high property values generally contain multiple chlorine atoms or other halogens, which tend to increase the property value significantly. For instance, molecules like ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl and ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl) have very high property values of 4.94800786 and 16.82736621, respectively, due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms.

The molecule ClCCl, also known as dichloromethane, contains two chlorine atoms. Based on the trend observed in the examples, the presence of chlorine atoms tends to increase the property value. However, ClCCl is a smaller and simpler molecule compared to the examples with extremely high values, which often have more complex structures and more chlorine atoms.

Considering these factors, ClCCl is likely to have a moderately high property value, but not as high as the more complex chlorinated compounds. A reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around 4.0, given its simpler structure compared to the examples with higher values.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 1.2484575919628509
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of chlorine atoms tends to increase the property value significantly. For instance, the molecule Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1, which is heavily brominated, has a high property value of 3.73039943. Similarly, the molecule Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which is 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, has a property value of 1.24845759.

Given that Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is also 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar to that of Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl. Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is approximately 1.24845759.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -0.9842920941048315
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be quite complex, with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and a significant degree of oxygenation, which suggests a high degree of polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The presence of methoxy groups (OC) and hydroxyl groups (O) further contributes to its polar nature.

In the examples provided, molecules with high polarity and multiple oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have negative property values. For instance, molecules like Nc1ncnc2n(ccc12)C3OC(CO)C(O)C3O (-0.58936075) and O=C1N(COC(=O)CCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (-0.96317391) have negative values, likely due to their polar nature and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Given the complexity and the functional groups present in the molecule, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Considering the examples and the structural features of the molecule, a predicted property value could be around -0.8. However, this is a qualitative prediction based on structural analysis and comparison with the provided examples.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.11688174839296955
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) atoms, along with the carbonyl group (C=O), suggests potential for polar interactions, which could influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar heteroatoms and functional groups, such as CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C, have a property value of -0.26150969. This molecule also contains a thiosemicarbazide-like structure and a tert-butyl group, making it a good reference point.

Considering the structural similarities, the predicted property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is likely to be close to -0.26150969. Therefore, the predicted specific property value for this molecule is approximately:

-0.26150969

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.33642650190913415
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is an ester with a phenyl group, similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's consider the example CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, which is a diketone with a phenyl group, and has a property value of -0.56989112. Another relevant example is CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2, which is a more complex molecule but contains the ester and phenyl group, with a property value of -0.90315372.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is simpler than the latter example but shares the ester and phenyl group characteristics. Given the trend in the examples, simpler aromatic esters tend to have property values closer to the range of -0.5 to -0.6.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be approximately -0.56989112, similar to the diketone example, as it shares the aromatic ester characteristic.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 2.980968238396357
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached. In the examples, linear alkyl chains like CCCCCCCCO (octanol) have a property value of 1.40757086, and CCCCCCCC (octane) would likely have a similar value due to its similar structure. The presence of a bromine atom, as seen in Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which has a property value of 0.10795641, suggests that the bromine atom might slightly lower the property value compared to a similar alkane without bromine.

Considering these observations, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be slightly lower than that of CCCCCCCCO due to the presence of the bromine atom. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around 1.2.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 1.4075708577080217
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for carbon monoxide (CO), we can analyze the examples provided and identify patterns or trends in the data. The examples include a variety of organic and inorganic compounds with different functional groups and structural features, and their associated property values range from highly negative to highly positive.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is a small, non-polar molecule with no additional functional groups or complex structures. In the examples, small and simple molecules like CCC (propane) and CC#C (propyne) have positive property values, while more complex or polar molecules tend to have negative values.

Given the simplicity and non-polar nature of CO, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly positive, similar to other small, non-polar molecules in the examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CO is approximately:

0.5
