SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.03629729964059015
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a linear aliphatic ester, specifically a decanoate ester. In the examples, we have a similar molecule, CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which is a nonanoate ester, with a property value of 1.55509148.

Given that the molecule in question is a decanoate ester, which is one carbon longer than the nonanoate ester, we can expect a similar property value, with a slight increase due to the additional carbon in the alkyl chain.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is approximately 1.6.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a fused heterocyclic structure, specifically a chlorinated benzoxazole. This structure is somewhat similar to other aromatic and heterocyclic compounds in the examples, such as c1cncnc1 (1.88448381) and Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (3.32973334).

Given the presence of chlorine atoms, which tend to increase the property value, and the heterocyclic nature of the compound, we can expect the property value to be positive and possibly in the range of other chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around 2.5.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.3652117543124516
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite, which contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an isopropyl group (CC(C)). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have relatively high property values (3.07732798). Nitro groups are known to be electron-withdrawing and can significantly affect the electronic properties of a molecule.

Considering the examples and the presence of the nitro group, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O will be positive and relatively high, similar to other nitro-containing compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O is approximately 3.0.

This molecule is a polycyclic compound with multiple rings and carbonyl groups. It resembles some of the more complex structures in the examples, such as:

- CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C, which has a property value of 3.55806368.
- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC, which has a property value of 2.85417931.

Both of these examples have multiple rings and carbonyl groups, similar to the given molecule. The presence of these features often contributes to a higher property value, as seen in the examples.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of carbonyl groups, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be in a similar range to the examples with complex ring systems and carbonyl groups.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A difluorobenzene moiety (Fc1cccc(F)c1), which is similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 with a property value of -0.63216958.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N), which is a common feature in several molecules with varying property values.
- A chlorobenzene moiety (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), which is similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of -0.41027134.

The combination of these features suggests a balance between electron-withdrawing groups (fluorine and chlorine) and the amide linkage, which can influence the overall property value. The presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups typically results in a more negative property value.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be around -0.5. This value reflects the influence of the electron-withdrawing groups and the structural similarity to other molecules in the dataset.

True Property: -0.5312850034955409
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with a linear chain and a branching methyl group. It is similar in structure to other small aliphatic ethers and alcohols in the examples, such as CCCCCCO (0.29989767) and CCCCCCCBr (0.75179523). These molecules have positive property values, likely due to their non-polar, hydrophobic nature and the presence of functional groups that do not significantly alter the overall polarity.

Given the structural similarity to these examples, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is likely to be positive and in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C is approximately 0.3.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. The presence of a bromine atom and carbonyl groups suggests that the molecule might have a property value that is slightly negative, as seen in some of the examples with halogens and carbonyl groups.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar features, such as halogens and carbonyl groups, tend to have property values around -0.5 to -0.7. For instance, CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of -0.72995647, and COc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of -0.73342853.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O would be around -0.7. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a physical or chemical property such as solubility, partition coefficient, or another molecular descriptor.

Biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples provided, aromatic compounds with multiple rings tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34 has a property value of 3.57571959, and it contains multiple aromatic rings.

Given that biphenyl is a simpler structure with two phenyl rings, we can expect its property value to be lower than that of more complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but higher than simpler or non-aromatic structures.

Based on this reasoning and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around 2.0.

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.44082792567446577
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of molecular structures, and their property values seem to be influenced by factors such as the presence of functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular size.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear alkane chain with a sulfur atom at the end. In the examples, linear alkanes and similar structures tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCCCCCC(C)O has a property value of -0.61946003, and CCCCCCC=C has a property value of 0.34236404. The presence of sulfur, which is more electronegative than carbon, might slightly alter the property value compared to a simple alkane.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCCCS is likely to be slightly negative, similar to other linear alkanes with small modifications. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be around -0.5.

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.518267876583916
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol, specifically 2-methyl-2-pentanol. In the examples, we have several aliphatic and branched hydrocarbons, as well as alcohols, which can help us make a prediction:

1. CCC(C)(C)C (2,2-dimethylbutane) has a property value of -0.72541269.
2. CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O (a cyclic alcohol) has a property value of -0.72587461.
3. CC(C)CC(C)O (a linear alcohol) has a property value of -0.08671115.

The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) in CCCC(C)(C)CO suggests that its property value might be closer to that of other alcohols. The linear alcohol CC(C)CC(C)O has a property value of -0.08671115, which is less negative than the branched hydrocarbon CCC(C)(C)C.

Considering the structural similarity to CC(C)CC(C)O and the influence of the hydroxyl group, the property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is likely to be slightly negative but closer to zero compared to the more negative values of branched hydrocarbons without the hydroxyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO is approximately -0.1.

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.23923983318661712
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is a naphthalene derivative, specifically 1-methylnaphthalene.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a property value of 2.17323153.
- Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (another naphthalene derivative) has a property value of 0.2093128.

The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is structurally similar to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, which is also a naphthalene derivative with a methyl group. Given the similarity, we can expect the property value to be close to that of Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately 0.2093128.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 0.003127304992086959
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic urea, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of 3.62926771. The main difference between the two molecules is the substitution of a methyl group (C) with a butyl group (C(C)CCC) in the new molecule.

The addition of a larger alkyl group (butyl) compared to a methyl group typically increases the hydrophobicity and potentially the steric bulk of the molecule, which might affect the property value. However, without specific information on how these changes quantitatively affect the property, we can make a qualitative prediction that the property value might be slightly higher due to the increased hydrophobic character.

Given the example's property value of 3.62926771 and considering the structural similarity with a slight increase in hydrophobicity, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the new molecule could be slightly higher than 3.62926771. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 3.7.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.632169578725231
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group is significant because it is highly electronegative and can influence the molecule's properties, such as its polarity and electron distribution.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with halogen substitutions on aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1 and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of multiple halogens, especially in a symmetrical arrangement, tends to increase the property value significantly, as seen in Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl.

Given that trifluoromethylbenzene has a single trifluoromethyl group, it is likely to have a property value that is negative but not as extreme as those with multiple halogens. The molecule is somewhat similar to Clc1ccc(I)cc1, which has a property value of -0.45668128.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around -0.4.

To predict the property value for the molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a sugar alcohol, specifically a form of glucose, which is a polyol with multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups.

From the examples, we see that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a very high property value (25.75817945). This suggests that the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups significantly increases the property value.

Given that OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is similar in structure to the example with a high property value, we can predict that it will also have a high property value. Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is likely to be in a similar range, around 25.75817945.

CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C

This molecule contains several key features:

1. **Ester Groups**: The presence of ester groups (CC(=O)O) is similar to the ester group in CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of 3.9880327.

2. **Polycyclic Structure**: The molecule has a polycyclic structure with multiple rings, similar to CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C.

3. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (C3(O) and C(O)) can influence the property, as seen in other molecules with hydroxyl groups.

4. **Ketone Groups**: The presence of ketone groups (C=O) is also a significant feature, similar to the ketone groups in CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C.

Considering these structural similarities, particularly with the molecule CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of 3.9880327, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for the given molecule will be in a similar range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C is approximately:

From the examples provided, polycyclic compounds with ketone and hydroxyl groups tend to have property values that are positive but not extremely high. For instance, the molecule CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O has a property value of 0.48427096. This molecule is somewhat similar in complexity and functional groups to the one in question.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O would be around 0.5. However, given the complexity and potential for variation, a more precise prediction might be slightly higher or lower. Therefore, a predicted property value could be approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an acetanilide derivative with a nitro group attached to the aromatic ring. 

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (-0.31547521) and COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (-0.32508076), tend to have negative property values. Additionally, the presence of an amide group, as seen in CNC(=O)C=C(C)OP(=O)(OC)OC (0.51339647) and CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1 (-0.73274915), can also influence the property value, often resulting in a negative value when combined with other electron-withdrawing groups.

Considering these factors, the presence of both the nitro group and the amide linkage in the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O suggests a negative property value. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.35.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12
True Property: 1.9829484491094216
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)SC), which is not directly represented in the examples, but similar functional groups like esters and thioesters are present.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring, which is seen in several examples with varying property values.
- A heterocyclic structure with a nitrogen and oxygen, similar to some of the examples with heterocycles.

Given the complexity and the presence of a chlorinated aromatic ring, which tends to increase the property value, and the presence of a phosphorothioate group, which might have a neutral or slightly negative effect, we can make an educated guess.

The examples with chlorinated aromatic rings have property values ranging from -0.41027134 to 17.64859782, with most being positive. The presence of a heterocyclic structure with nitrogen and oxygen, as seen in some examples, tends to have a positive or neutral effect.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be slightly positive, around 0.5.

True Property: 0.5700997756163453
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)(C)CO is tert-butanol, which is a simple alcohol with a tertiary carbon structure. In the examples, we have several alcohols and hydrocarbons with varying chain lengths and branching:

1. CCCCCCC(C)O, -0.73349661
2. CCC(C)CO, 1.45886662
3. CCCCCCCCC(C)O, -0.61946003

The molecule CCC(C)CO, which is isobutanol, has a property value of 1.45886662. Tert-butanol (CC(C)(C)CO) is similar in that it is also a branched alcohol, but it is more compact due to the tertiary carbon structure.

Given the examples, the property value for tert-butanol is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to that of isobutanol, but potentially slightly lower due to the increased branching and compactness, which might affect the property in question.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO (tert-butanol) would be around 1.2.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a bicyclic compound with two nitrogen-containing rings, similar to purine derivatives. 

From the examples, we see that nitrogen-containing heterocycles, especially those with multiple nitrogen atoms, tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F has a property value of 5.38774582, and OCC1OC(C(O)C1O)n2cnc3c(O)ncnc23 has a very high property value of 12.55294915. These examples suggest that the presence of nitrogen atoms in a heterocyclic structure can significantly increase the property value.

Given the structure of O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12, which is a bicyclic nitrogen-rich compound, it is reasonable to predict a relatively high property value. However, it is not as complex or as heavily substituted as the example with the highest value. Therefore, a moderate to high value is expected.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 would be around 6.0, similar to the example Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1, which has a property value of 6.00033085.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 1.6343613666367096
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, an ester with a relatively simple structure.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Simple aliphatic esters like CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC have negative property values, such as -0.71974221.
- Other small aliphatic molecules like CCC(C)(C)C have a property value of -0.72541269.

Given that CC(C)OC=O is a small aliphatic ester, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and similar to other small aliphatic esters.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O is approximately -0.7.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a urea derivative with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with aromatic rings (like phenyl groups) tend to have property values that are not extremely high or low, often around the range of -0.7 to 0.7.
- The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) and amide linkages (N-C=O) can influence the property value, often making it more positive compared to hydrocarbons or simple halogenated compounds.

Given these observations, the molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 is similar to other aromatic amides in the dataset. For instance, NC(=O)c1cccnc1 has a property value of 2.78311688, which is relatively high due to the presence of the carbonyl and nitrogen atoms in a conjugated system.

Considering the structure of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is positive but not as high as the pyridine derivative, since it lacks the additional nitrogen in the aromatic ring that could further increase the property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 would be around 1.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The given molecule is triphenylene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a planar structure composed of four fused benzene rings.

From the examples, we observe that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 (a larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon), have relatively high property values. The example c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 has a property value of 5.21445349.

Triphenylene is smaller than the example provided but still has a significant degree of aromaticity and conjugation, which typically contribute to higher property values. Given this, we can expect the property value for triphenylene to be lower than 5.21445349 but still relatively high compared to simpler aromatic compounds.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (triphenylene) would be around 3.5.

The molecule in question contains:
- A sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N), which is known to be polar and can contribute to a higher property value.
- An aromatic ring (phenyl group) with an amine substituent, which can also increase the property value due to its electron-donating nature.
- A guanidine group (NC(=N)N), which is highly polar and basic, potentially increasing the property value.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with polar functional groups and aromatic rings, such as O=C1NC(=O)c2ccccc12 (property value: 1.62794875) and Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O (property value: 1.01149441), tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of multiple polar groups and aromatic systems in the molecule suggests a property value in the positive range.

True Property: 1.163159100722002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with negative property values.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which is also present in some examples with negative property values.
- An alkene group (C=C) in the side chain, which is not very common in the examples but can contribute to the overall property.

Based on the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (0.08067614) and Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O (-0.36502803), tend to have negative or slightly positive property values.
- The presence of a trifluoromethyl group, as seen in some examples, often correlates with negative property values.
- The combination of these groups suggests a tendency towards a negative property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around -0.4.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 1.6343613666367096
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl acetate, an ester. In the examples, esters and similar functional groups tend to have property values around the range of -0.2 to 0.3. For instance, CC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of 0.23626079, and CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 has a property value of -0.13092486.

Considering the structural similarity of CC(C)OC=O to these examples, particularly the presence of the ester functional group and the relatively small size of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around 0.2.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O is approximately 0.2.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.6513224062818905
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's consider the following examples from the list:
- c1ccccc1O (phenol) has a property value of -0.05688996.
- Cc1cccc(N)c1 (toluidine) has a property value of -0.2954923.
- Cc1cccc(C)c1 (xylene) has a property value of -0.69748955.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a combination of a phenol and a xylene, with a methyl group and a hydroxyl group on the benzene ring. The presence of the hydroxyl group, which is more polar than a methyl group, suggests that the property value might be closer to that of phenol than xylene.

Considering the examples and the nature of the substituents, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be slightly more negative than phenol but not as negative as xylene. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.1 to -0.2.

A specific predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is -0.15.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)O), which is similar to the phosphorothioate groups in the examples COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl. These examples have property values of 3.30455458, 2.77204708, and 2.9326034, respectively. The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) in these examples contributes to their relatively high property values.

In the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, the aromatic ring is substituted with a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C). The thiomethyl group is less electronegative than halogens, which might result in a lower property value compared to the halogenated examples.

Considering these structural differences and the influence of the substituents, the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be lower than those of the halogenated examples but still relatively high due to the presence of the phosphorothioate group.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 would be around 2.5.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 13.10321377218836
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples given.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with multiple chlorine atoms attached to the biphenyl structure. In the examples, highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have high property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 17.64859782, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 22.83846116.

Given the high degree of chlorination and the aromatic nature of the molecule, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be relatively high, similar to the other highly chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 17.0.

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 1.36118617741247
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group attached to the terminal carbon. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Simple aliphatic chains like CCC (propane) have a property value of -0.09089656.
- The presence of a nitro group (N(=O)=O) tends to increase the property value, as seen in molecules like CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of 1.73705319.

Considering these observations, the presence of the nitro group in CCCN(=O)=O will likely increase the property value compared to a simple alkane like propane. However, since the molecule is relatively small and less complex than the example with multiple nitro groups and additional substituents, the increase in the property value will not be as significant.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be slightly positive, reflecting the influence of the nitro group. A predicted value could be around 0.2.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.6866257290455628
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, which is similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's consider the examples with similar structures:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1: -0.29351215
- c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12: 0.47107653

The first example, Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, is a chlorobenzene with a bromine substituent, and it has a property value of -0.29351215. The second example, c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12, is a naphthalene with a bromine substituent, and it has a property value of 0.47107653.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is more similar to the first example, Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, because both are monosubstituted benzene rings with a halogen substituent. The presence of fluorine, which is more electronegative than chlorine, might slightly affect the property value, but the overall structure is quite similar.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is likely to be close to that of Clc1ccc(Br)cc1. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be approximately -0.293.

True Property: -0.7175191922684043
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with an additional methyl group and a hydroxyl group. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with cyclic and bicyclic structures.

Looking at the examples, we see that molecules with cyclic structures and alcohol groups, such as OCCOc1ccccc1 (0.50564759) and CC1CCCO1 (0.27113274), tend to have positive property values. The presence of a tertiary alcohol group, which can increase the polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, might also contribute to a positive property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is likely to be positive and in the range of the examples with similar features. A reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.3 to 0.6.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is approximately 0.4.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.6896232872571286
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), an amide linkage, and a phenyl ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 1.05468023. The main difference is the presence of a thioether linkage (SC) in the example, which is replaced by an amide linkage in the target molecule.

The amide linkage is generally less polarizing than a thioether linkage, which might slightly reduce the property value. However, the overall structure, including the phosphorothioate and phenyl ring, remains similar.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would likely be slightly lower than 1.05468023. A reasonable estimate could be around 0.9 to 1.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately 0.95.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a ketone and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, specifically a methylated benzotriazole.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:

1. Molecules with aromatic rings and nitrogen heterocycles, such as Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O (-0.40117927) and CNc1ccccc1 (-0.45199928), tend to have negative property values.
2. Molecules with ketone groups, such as CCC(=O)C (0.64943576) and O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (-0.48081419), show a range of values, but often negative when combined with aromatic systems.
3. The presence of additional methyl groups, as in Cc1cccc(C)c1C (-0.67730272), tends to lower the property value.

Considering these observations, the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C has features that suggest a negative property value, similar to other aromatic and nitrogen-containing compounds. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.5. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is approximately -0.5.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.7004653856345673
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which is a linear chain with a total of 9 carbon atoms.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCCC(=O)OC, which is a similar ester with a slightly shorter chain, has a property value of -0.48740867.
- CCCCC, a simple alkane with 5 carbon atoms, has a property value of -0.71817132.
- CCCCCCCCI, a linear chain with an iodine atom, has a property value of 0.10309152.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar to the ester example, but with a longer carbon chain, which might slightly increase the property value due to increased hydrophobic interactions and molecular size. However, it is still an ester, which tends to have negative property values in the examples provided.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be slightly higher than -0.48740867 but still negative, due to the ester functional group. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.45.

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.16770729199005194
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is methyl benzoate, an ester formed from benzoic acid and methanol.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 with a property value of -0.28587244
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 with a property value of -0.56269842

Both of these molecules are esters with aromatic rings, similar to methyl benzoate. The first example has an additional hydroxyl group on the aromatic ring, which could affect the property value. The second example is ethyl benzoate, which is very similar to methyl benzoate, differing only by one carbon in the alkyl chain.

Given the close structural similarity between methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1) and ethyl benzoate (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1), we can expect the property value of methyl benzoate to be close to that of ethyl benzoate. Since methyl benzoate has a slightly smaller alkyl group, it might have a slightly less negative property value than ethyl benzoate.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate) would be slightly less negative than -0.56269842. A predicted value could be around -0.5.

True Property: -0.4703134589552098
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the overall molecular structure.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, also known as 1,3-butadiene. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons and those with unsaturation (double or triple bonds) tend to have negative property values. For instance, CC/C=C/C (a linear hydrocarbon with a double bond) has a property value of -0.63211426, and C=Cc1ccccc1 (a styrene-like structure) has a property value of -0.73343139.

Given the structure of C=CCC=C and its similarity to these examples, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Considering the trend and the degree of unsaturation, a value slightly more negative than -0.63211426 but less negative than -0.73343139 would be appropriate.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C is approximately -0.68.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is a simple compound with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. This structure is similar to other halogenated compounds in the examples, such as FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br, which has a property value of -0.71181305. The presence of multiple bromine atoms, which are heavy and electronegative, likely contributes to a similar property value.

Given the simplicity of BrC(Br)Br compared to more complex structures in the examples, and considering the property value of similar halogenated compounds, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around -0.7. Therefore, the predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S) with ethoxy groups (OCC).
- A thioester linkage (SC).
- A chloroethyl group (CCl).
- An imide group (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O), which is a cyclic structure with a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, have a property value of 2.26422649.
- Molecules with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups, such as Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2cc(Cl)c(F)c(Cl)c2F, have a property value of 2.82953818.
- Molecules with chloro groups and aromatic rings, such as OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, have a property value of 7.29046871.

Considering these structural similarities and the presence of both phosphorothioate and aromatic imide groups, the property value is likely to be influenced by the combination of these features. The presence of multiple functional groups that contribute to higher property values in the examples suggests that the property value for this molecule will be relatively high.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 2.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A dimethylamino group (CN(C)C(=O)), which is similar to the CN(C)C(=O) group in CN(C)C(=O)C and CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, both of which have positive property values (3.06892058 and 2.62494967, respectively).
- A chloro-substituted aromatic ring, which is present in several examples with varying property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 has a property value of 3.33393741, while Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a value of 2.16961854.
- A heterocyclic moiety (n2nc(oc2=O)), which is not directly comparable to any specific example but adds complexity to the molecule.
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C), which is a bulky substituent that can influence the property value.

Considering these features, the molecule is likely to have a positive property value due to the presence of the dimethylamino group and the chloro-substituted aromatic ring, both of which are associated with positive values in the examples. The heterocyclic moiety and tert-butyl group may further influence the property value, but the overall trend suggests a positive value.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be around 2.5.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with three chlorine atoms attached to the rings. This structure is somewhat similar to the example c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 1.36647054. The presence of additional chlorine atoms in the molecule we are analyzing could potentially increase the property value due to the increased electron-withdrawing effect and molecular weight.

Considering the examples and the structural features, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be slightly higher than 1.36647054, due to the additional chlorine atom. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 1.5.

The molecule CC/C=C\C is a simple linear alkene, similar to the example CC/C=C/C, which has a property value of -0.63211426. Given the structural similarity and the fact that both molecules are small alkenes, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC/C=C\C will be close to that of CC/C=C/C.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C is approximately -0.63211426.

4. **CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1**: This is an ester with a property value of -0.56269842.

The molecule CCCOCC is an ether, which is generally less polar than alcohols and esters. The examples with alcohols and esters have a range of property values, but ethers are expected to have a property value closer to neutral or slightly positive due to their lower polarity compared to alcohols.

Considering the structure and the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be slightly positive, but not as high as the alcohols. Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCOCC could be around:

This structure is somewhat similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 0.01992449. Both molecules contain a tertiary amide linkage and phenyl groups, although the example has an additional heterocyclic component.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of aromatic rings and the amide linkage, we can infer that the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be close to that of the example with a value of 0.01992449.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is approximately 0.02.

Considering these structural similarities, particularly the presence of the bromobenzene moiety, which tends to contribute to negative property values, and the acetamide group, which also appears in molecules with negative values, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for this molecule.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be approximately -0.65.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:

1. Molecules with benzene rings (aromatic rings) tend to have property values around -0.2 to -0.7, such as:
   - Cc1ccccc1N: -0.2954923
   - Clc1ccc(Br)cc1: -0.29351215
   - CCc1ccc(C)cc1: -0.69748955
   - C=Cc1ccccc1: -0.73343139

2. Molecules with alkyl chains or branched alkyl groups attached to benzene rings also show similar property values:
   - CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1: -0.27497226
   - CCc1ccc(C)cc1: -0.69748955

3. The presence of additional functional groups or heteroatoms can significantly alter the property value, but in this case, the molecule is relatively simple with just an isobutyl group and a benzene ring.

Considering these observations, the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is likely to be in the range of -0.2 to -0.7. Given the similarity to the example CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1, which has a property value of -0.27497226, we can predict a similar value for isobutylbenzene.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is approximately -0.28.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.2010517088812003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:

1. Molecules with aromatic rings (e.g., benzene derivatives) tend to have a wide range of property values, often influenced by the presence of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups.
2. The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) in the examples often results in a property value that is slightly positive or negative, depending on the rest of the structure.

For instance:
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1O has a property value of 1.84387711, which is influenced by the presence of both an amide and a phenol group.
- COc1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.42065781, which is a methoxybenzene, showing a slight negative value.
- O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.20598496, indicating the influence of nitro groups on the benzene ring.

Benzaldehyde has a simple structure with a single aldehyde group attached to a benzene ring. The aldehyde group is slightly electron-withdrawing, which might lead to a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) would be around -0.1 to -0.3. Given the examples and the influence of the aldehyde group, I would predict a specific property value of approximately:

-0.15

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 3.140405846808281
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring, similar to some of the examples. The presence of the nitro group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, often contributes to a more negative property value. Additionally, the molecule contains a lactam ring, which is a cyclic amide, and this can also influence the property value.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2, have a property value of 3.45217835.
- Molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl, have a high property value of 17.64859782.
- Molecules with amide groups, such as CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, have a property value of 0.80714771.

Considering these factors, the presence of both the nitro group and the lactam ring suggests a property value that is likely to be influenced by the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group, but not as high as the highly chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be around 1.5.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.2664854859786823
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group (N-N linkage).

From the examples, we can identify a few relevant molecules:

1. Nc1ccccc1 (aniline) has a property value of 0.13097327.
2. N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (azobenzene) has a property value of 1.61248749.

The target molecule, N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, is structurally similar to azobenzene but with a hydrazine linkage instead of an azo linkage. The hydrazine linkage is less electron-withdrawing than the azo linkage, which might result in a lower property value compared to azobenzene.

Considering these structural similarities and differences, the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be between the values for aniline and azobenzene. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 1.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a relatively small and compact structure with two amide groups and a cyclohexane ring. In the examples, similar cyclic structures with amide groups, such as C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1, have property values around 2.17139514. However, the presence of a cyclohexane ring in the given molecule might slightly alter the property.

Considering the examples and the structural features of the given molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 2.0. This accounts for the cyclic nature and the presence of amide groups, which are common in the examples with similar property values.

True Property: 5.94588356571585
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccccc1Cl (-0.41027134) and Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (12.30646264), tend to have negative property values, except when there is a significant increase in molecular complexity or size, which can lead to a positive value.
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings, as seen in biphenyl structures, can influence the property value. For instance, biphenyl structures like C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13 (2.50691379) have positive values, but the addition of electronegative groups like chlorine tends to decrease the value.

Considering these factors, the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is expected to have a negative property value due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and the biphenyl structure. However, the exact value will be influenced by the specific arrangement and number of chlorine atoms.

Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around -0.5.

True Property: -0.5650599245821882
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Simple aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions, such as Cc1ccccc1N (-0.2954923) and Cc1ccccc1 (not provided, but typically around 0), tend to have property values around 0 or slightly negative.
2. The presence of additional alkyl groups, as seen in CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 (0.898395), tends to increase the property value slightly due to increased hydrophobicity and molecular size.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is diethylbenzene, it is similar to the example CCCCCCCc1ccccc1, but with fewer carbon atoms. Therefore, we can expect the property value to be positive but less than 0.898395.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a para-substituted aniline with a sulfonamide group. 

Looking at the examples, we can find some similar structures:
- Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.28563985. This molecule is a para-nitroaniline, which is somewhat similar in terms of having an electron-withdrawing group (nitro) on the benzene ring.
- Oc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 has a property value of -0.34200243. This is a biphenyl with a hydroxyl group, which is less similar but still provides some context for aromatic systems.

The sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is a strong electron-withdrawing group, similar to the nitro group in terms of its effect on the aromatic ring. Given the similarity to the para-nitroaniline example, we can expect the property value to be in a similar range.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be around 0.2 to 0.3. Therefore, a specific prediction could be:

Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a calculated property such as logP (partition coefficient), solubility, or another physicochemical property. The molecule you provided, c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically triphenylene.

From the examples, we can observe that larger, more complex aromatic systems tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 has a property value of 6.59322335, and c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 has a property value of 7.49303801. These are both large, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Given that triphenylene is a large, planar aromatic system, I would predict its property value to be somewhat similar to these examples, likely in the range of 6 to 8. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of triphenylene (c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34) would be approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the molecules in the examples that have high property values, particularly those with multiple aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups.

For instance, the molecule OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5 has a very high property value of 16.98204588, and it contains multiple aromatic rings and oxygen functionalities. Similarly, the molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O has a high property value of 22.60284402, and it is rich in hydroxyl groups.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for the given molecule will also be relatively high.

Therefore, I predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 to be approximately 15.0.

True Property: 0.1781266453162798
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)O), an amide group (NC(C)=O), and a thiol group (SC). The presence of these functional groups can influence the property value.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, have relatively high property values (2.9326034). However, the presence of additional electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, can further increase the property value, as seen in Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (17.64859782).

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC does not have such strong electron-withdrawing groups, but it does have a combination of functional groups that could contribute to a moderate property value.

Considering these factors, I would predict the property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC to be around 1.5.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.6104277620214007
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their properties. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular structure.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, symmetrical molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, especially those with aromatic rings or complex structures, tend to have higher property values. However, simpler molecules with chlorine, such as those without aromatic rings or additional functional groups, tend to have lower property values.

Given the simplicity and symmetry of Cl\C=C/Cl, and considering the examples with similar halogenated structures, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be relatively low. Based on the trends observed, a predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl could be around 0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and their properties. Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle similar to benzene but with a nitrogen atom replacing one of the carbon atoms in the ring. 

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23, have a property value of -0.58470366. Pyridine is a simpler structure compared to this example, but it shares the aromatic nitrogen feature.

Considering the examples and the nature of pyridine, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccncc1 would be around -0.5. However, given the specific examples and the trend, a more precise prediction would be:

The molecule in question contains several functional groups and structural features:
- An ester linkage (COC(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)
- An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23)
- A pyridine-like structure (ccnc)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens (like Cl) tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with ester and amide linkages also tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms (like N and O) can influence the property value, often making it more negative.

Considering these observations, the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 is likely to have a negative property value due to its structural complexity, presence of aromatic rings, and halogen substitution.

Based on the trends and examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.5. However, given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, it could be slightly more negative. Therefore, a predicted property value could be approximately -0.6.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the trends and characteristics of the given examples. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol with a five-carbon chain, also known as 1-pentanol.

From the examples, we observe that:

1. Linear alkanes and simple alcohols tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCCCCC (hexane) and OC1CCCCCCC1 (cycloheptanol) have negative values.
2. The presence of an alcohol group (OH) in a linear chain seems to slightly increase the property value compared to the corresponding alkane, but it remains negative.

Given these observations, CCCCCO, being a simple linear alcohol, is expected to have a property value that is negative and possibly slightly higher (less negative) than a similar alkane without the alcohol group.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be around -0.6.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is known to increase polarity.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which also contributes to polarity and potential hydrogen bonding.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which can influence the electronic distribution and stability.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can affect solubility and polarity.

From the examples, molecules with polar functional groups like sulfonyl and amide tend to have positive property values, especially when combined with aromatic systems. For instance, the molecule CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C has a property value of 1.0812664, and it contains both a sulfonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is likely to be positive and in a similar range to other polar, aromatic-containing molecules. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 1.0.

This molecule contains several key features:
- An ester group (COC(=O))
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring
- A heterocyclic ring with nitrogen
- Aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, tend to have positive property values.
- Aromatic rings and ester groups are common in molecules with both positive and negative property values, but the presence of multiple functional groups like nitro groups can influence the property towards a positive value.

Considering these observations, the presence of the nitro group and the overall complexity of the molecule, it is likely that the property value will be slightly positive. Therefore, I would predict a property value around:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two carbonyl groups (C=O) and two nitrogen atoms in a six-membered ring. This structure is relatively small and lacks the extended conjugation or heavy halogenation seen in some of the examples with high property values.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar features, such as small cyclic structures with carbonyl groups and nitrogen atoms, tend to have property values around the range of -0.5 to 0.5. For instance, the molecule OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O has a property value of -0.72454698, and it contains carbonyl and nitrogen atoms in a cyclic structure.

Given the lack of extensive conjugation or heavy halogenation, and considering the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately -0.5.

SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 0.16968533789025775
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure, consisting of a chloroethane (ethyl chloride) group. In the examples, simple aliphatic hydrocarbons like CCCC (butane) and CCC(C)(C)CC (2,2-dimethylbutane) have negative property values, while more complex or aromatic structures tend to have positive or higher values.

Given that ClCC is a small, simple molecule with a halogen (chlorine) attached, it is likely to have a property value similar to other small, simple molecules with halogens. For instance, Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) has a property value of -0.73349733, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (hexachlorobenzene) has a much higher value due to its complexity and multiple chlorine atoms.

Considering the simplicity of ClCC and the presence of a single chlorine atom, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be slightly negative, similar to other small, simple halogenated hydrocarbons.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCC is approximately -0.5.

From the examples, we can observe that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 5.94588357, and Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a property value of 12.30646264. These examples suggest that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings contribute to higher property values.

Given that Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a pyridine ring (which is similar to a benzene ring but with a nitrogen atom) and a trichloromethyl group, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be somewhat similar to the other highly chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCC(O)CCC, which is a similar alcohol with a longer carbon chain, has a property value of -0.61781117.
- CCC(C)CCO, another alcohol with a similar structure but shorter chain, has a property value of -0.08894506.
- CCC(CC)CO, which is also a similar alcohol, has a property value of -0.08894506.

Given that CCCCC(C)O is structurally similar to these alcohols, particularly CCC(C)CCO and CCC(CC)CO, we can infer that its property value will be close to these examples. The property values for these similar alcohols are around -0.08894506.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have negative property values. For instance:
   - ClCCl (dichloromethane) has a property value of -0.09811908.
   - ClC(Cl)Cl (chloroform) has a property value of -0.63965866.
   - ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl (carbon tetrachloride) has a property value of -0.68449544.
   - Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl (1,2-dichlorobenzene) has a property value of 3.33393741, which is an exception due to the presence of two benzene rings.

2. The presence of multiple halogen atoms generally results in a more negative property value, as seen with:
   - ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl (carbon tetrachloride) having a more negative value than ClCCl (dichloromethane).

3. The presence of a benzene ring with halogen substituents, such as in Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1, results in a negative property value of -0.63567852.

Considering these observations, 1,4-dibromobenzene is expected to have a negative property value due to the presence of two bromine atoms on a benzene ring. The property value is likely to be similar to other halogenated aromatic compounds with negative values.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 (1,4-dibromobenzene) is approximately -0.6.

Given that the property value seems to increase with the number of chlorine atoms and the complexity of the aromatic system, we can expect the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl to be lower than 42.27492695 but still relatively high due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and the biphenyl structure.

The molecule in question is a triaryl phosphate ester, which includes three aromatic rings and a phosphate group. The presence of aromatic rings and a phosphate group can influence the property value, as seen in the examples.

1. Aromatic rings: Molecules with multiple aromatic rings, such as c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 (6.59322335) and Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl (5.94588357), tend to have higher property values. However, the presence of electron-withdrawing groups or other functional groups can modify this effect.

2. Phosphate group: The presence of a phosphate group, as seen in CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O (1.05468023) and CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC (0.8125442), can contribute to a moderate increase in the property value.

3. Substituents: The presence of methyl groups on the aromatic rings can also influence the property value, as seen in molecules like CC(C)c1ccccc1 (-0.56605681).

Considering these factors, the molecule Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1 is expected to have a property value influenced by the aromatic rings and the phosphate group. The combination of these features suggests a moderate to high property value.

Based on the analysis of the examples and the structural features of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 1.5.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.3092804575914138
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to increase lipophilicity and potentially increase the property value.
- An aromatic ring, which is common in many of the examples and can contribute to a range of property values.
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle, which can influence the property value depending on its context.
- Chlorine atoms, which are present in several examples with higher property values.

Based on the examples, molecules with multiple halogens, especially chlorine, tend to have higher property values. The presence of the CF3 group also suggests a potential increase in the property value. Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be on the higher side.

Given the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O would be approximately 5.0.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.3250807623884179
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring, with a nitro group (NO2) also attached to the ring.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have positive property values. For instance, O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.20598496, which is slightly negative but close to zero.
- Compounds with methoxy groups, like c1ccccc1O, have a property value of -0.05688996, which is also close to zero.

Considering these observations, the presence of both a methoxy group and a nitro group on the benzene ring in COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O suggests that the property value will be influenced by both the electron-donating effect of the methoxy group and the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group. The net effect is likely to result in a property value that is slightly positive or close to zero.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around 0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, which is similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 0.55270021. Both molecules are heavily chlorinated, which generally increases the electron-withdrawing nature and can affect the molecular polarity and other properties.

Given the structural similarity and the high degree of chlorination, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl will be in a similar range, possibly slightly higher due to the additional complexity and potential for increased steric effects.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl would be approximately 0.6.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 1.6300853233513402
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with simple alkyl chains and esters tend to have negative property values, such as CC(O)c1ccccc1 (-0.46259163) and CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 (-0.13092486).
- Molecules with more complex or aromatic structures, or those containing multiple functional groups, tend to have more positive or higher property values.

Given that CCCOC=O is a relatively simple ester with a small alkyl chain, it is likely to have a negative property value. Comparing it to similar structures, such as CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, which has a property value of -0.13092486, we can predict that CCCOC=O will have a slightly more negative value due to its simpler structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be approximately -0.2.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.6445360847828135
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a long-chain ester, specifically a decanoate ester, which is similar to some of the aliphatic and ester-containing molecules in the examples.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Aliphatic chains like CC (0.56732384) and CCI (-0.12524662) have relatively low property values.
- Esters like CCCOC (0.53463475) also have low property values.

Given that CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is a larger molecule with a long aliphatic chain and an ester functional group, it is likely to have a property value that is slightly positive, similar to other aliphatic and ester-containing molecules.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have negative property values.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, have positive property values.
- The presence of chlorine atoms in aromatic rings tends to contribute to negative property values, as seen in Cl\C=C/Cl and ClCC(Cl)Cl.

Considering these factors, the molecule has a combination of features that contribute both positively and negatively to the property value. The presence of the nitro group and chlorine atoms suggests a tendency towards a negative value, while the amide linkage might offset this slightly.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be slightly negative, around -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O) attached to aromatic rings. This is similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 2.26422649. The presence of multiple aromatic rings and sulfur-containing groups suggests that the property value might be influenced by these features.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple phosphorothioate groups, which are likely to increase the property value due to their electron-withdrawing nature and the overall molecular size, we can predict that the property value will be somewhat higher than the example with a single phosphorothioate group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 would be approximately 3.5.

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.08067614054701687
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can identify some relevant patterns:

1. **Phenol and Nitro Groups**: The molecule NC(=O)c1ccccc1O has a property value of 1.84387711. This molecule has a phenol group, similar to our target molecule, but with an additional amide group. The presence of the phenol group seems to contribute positively to the property value.

2. **Nitrobenzene**: The molecule Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which is nitrobenzene with a methyl group, has a property value of -0.59016208. The nitro group seems to contribute negatively to the property value.

3. **Chlorinated Phenols**: The molecule Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, which is a chlorinated phenol, has a property value of 0.04164614. This suggests that the phenol group contributes positively, but the chlorines may have a different effect compared to nitro groups.

Considering these observations, the presence of both a phenol and a nitro group in Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O suggests a balance between the positive contribution of the phenol and the negative contribution of the nitro group. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which might lead to a more negative property value compared to a simple phenol.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the nitro group. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.6, similar to the nitrobenzene example, but slightly adjusted for the presence of the phenol group.

Predicted property value: **-0.6**

True Property: 73.3980519399568
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a complex sugar-like structure with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, resembling polysaccharides or complex carbohydrates.

From the examples, we notice that molecules with long carbon chains or multiple hydroxyl groups tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule "C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O" has a property value of 17.54667881, which is quite high, likely due to its multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic structure.

The given molecule, "OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O," is even more complex, with several ether linkages and hydroxyl groups, suggesting it might have a similar or even higher property value due to its increased complexity and number of functional groups.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value for the given molecule to be approximately 18.0, considering its structural complexity and the trend observed in the examples.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.560594612520295
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of molecular structures, and their property values seem to be influenced by factors such as molecular size, functional groups, and the presence of aromatic rings or heteroatoms.

The molecule CCC#C is a simple alkyne, specifically 1-butyne. It is a small, linear molecule with a terminal alkyne group. In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules with fewer functional groups and less complexity tend to have property values closer to zero, often negative, but not extremely so.

Considering the examples, such as CCC(C)C(=O)C (-0.34493233) and CC(C)OC=O (1.63436137), which are small molecules with simple functional groups, the property value for CCC#C is likely to be in a similar range. However, since CCC#C is even simpler and lacks additional functional groups that might increase the property value, it is reasonable to predict a property value slightly negative or close to zero.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C is approximately -0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 2.26422649.
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine atoms, similar to Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl (0.55743395) and Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (5.94588357).
- An ether linkage (O-C) connecting the phosphorothioate group to the aromatic ring.

Considering these features, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring and the phosphorothioate group suggests a relatively high property value. The examples with similar features have property values ranging from moderate to high.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl would be around 3.5.

True Property: 4.582561283803348
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is a pyridine derivative with a carbonyl group (C=O) attached to a hydrazine moiety (NN). This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2, which has a high property value of 6.56963221, likely due to the presence of nitrogen heterocycles and carbonyl groups.

However, the molecule in question is simpler and lacks the additional nitrogen heterocycle, which might contribute to a lower property value. The presence of the carbonyl and hydrazine groups could still contribute positively, but not to the extent seen in the more complex nitrogen heterocycle example.

Considering these factors and the range of property values in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be around 0.5. This accounts for the positive contribution of the carbonyl and hydrazine groups, but not as high as the more complex nitrogen heterocycles.

True Property: 1.8757757063512779
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Functional Groups and Structure**: 
   - The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, which has a property value of -0.57356423.
   - It also contains an amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is present in several molecules with varying property values, such as CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1 (-0.09270601) and CCN2c1cc(N(C)C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23 (-0.20001154).
   - The molecule has a piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1), which is a saturated heterocyclic amine. This feature is not directly present in the examples, but similar cyclic structures like C/C1CCC(\C)CC1 (-0.54960262) can provide some insight.

2. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - The presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a potential for a negative property value, as seen in the example with a similar group.
   - The amide linkage and the cyclic amine structure might contribute to a slightly less negative or even positive value, depending on the overall balance of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects.

3. **Overall Prediction**:
   - Considering the balance of functional groups and the examples provided, the property value is likely to be slightly negative, influenced by the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be approximately -0.3.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.06383161192269478
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCCCC is a linear alkane, specifically octane.

From the examples, we can observe that linear alkanes and similar structures tend to have negative property values. For instance:

- CCCCCCCO (heptanol) has a property value of -0.61875483.
- CCCCCC/C=C/C (hexene) has a property value of -0.60431913.
- C/C1CCCCC1\C (methylcyclohexane) has a property value of -0.54960262.

Given that CCCCCCCC is a simple linear alkane, we can expect its property value to be in a similar range, likely slightly more negative than the values for the slightly more complex or branched alkanes and alkenes listed above.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (octane) would be approximately -0.65.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: -0.6791247800921922
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as functional groups, molecular size, and overall molecular geometry. The examples provided suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and structural features.

The molecule in question, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, contains several notable features:
- A cyclohexane ring system with multiple fused rings.
- A ketone group (C=O).
- An alcohol group (O).
- An alkyne group (C#C).

Based on the examples, molecules with ketone and alcohol groups tend to have positive property values, while the presence of an alkyne group can influence the value depending on its context within the molecule. The complex ring structure and the presence of these functional groups suggest a property value that is likely positive but not extremely high.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.8.

Predicting the property value for the given molecule, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and hydroxyl groups, similar to some of the more complex structures in the examples.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, which can contribute to higher property values in some cases, I would predict a relatively high property value. However, without a specific model or further context on what the property represents, this is a qualitative assessment.

Based on the examples, I would estimate the property value to be around 7.5. This is a rough estimate, considering the structural complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups that could influence the property in a manner similar to other high-value examples.

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.6685238869425106
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is a phenol (Oc1ccccc1) with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we have:
- Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (a nitrophenol) with a property value of 0.08067614.
- Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) with a property value of -0.53463085.
- Clc1ccccc1I (iodobenzene) with a property value of -0.45668128.
- Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (biphenyl with chlorine) with a property value of 0.27200372.

The presence of a chlorine atom generally tends to decrease the property value compared to the parent hydrocarbon, as seen in the examples of halogenated benzenes. However, the presence of a hydroxyl group (phenol) can increase the property value due to its polar nature.

Considering these factors, the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is likely to be slightly positive, as the hydroxyl group may have a more significant impact than the chlorine atom in this case. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around 0.1.

To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 contains:
- A chloro-substituted aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl, which have high property values (22.83846116 and 17.64859782, respectively).
- An alkyne group (C#C), which is not directly present in the examples but can be considered as a feature that might not significantly increase the property value.
- An ester linkage (OC(=O)), which is present in several examples with varying property values.
- An amide linkage (NC(=O)), which is present in examples like FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O (0.30928046) and CCC(C)C1(CC(Br)=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O (-0.40928272).

Considering these features, the presence of chloro-substituted aromatic rings tends to increase the property value significantly, while the other features might have a neutral or slightly negative effect. Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 is likely to be moderately high, but not as high as the fully chlorinated aromatic compounds.

A reasonable prediction for the property value could be around 2.5.

True Property: 1.5218300139127556
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2) attached to the central carbon.
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of heterocyclic rings like pyrimidine can also contribute to higher property values.
- The presence of multiple chlorine atoms in aromatic systems often results in higher property values, as seen in examples with high values.

Considering these factors, the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl has multiple aromatic rings, two chlorine substituents, and a pyrimidine ring, which suggests a relatively high property value.

Based on these observations and comparisons, I would predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately 8.5.

The presence of the ester functional group (OC=O) in CCCCCOC=O is similar to the example CCCCC(=O)OCC (ethyl butanoate), which has a property value of 0.00536595. The ester group can influence the property value by introducing polarity and potential hydrogen bonding interactions.

Considering the structural similarity to these examples, particularly the influence of the ester group, the predicted property value for CCCCCOC=O is likely to be close to that of CCCCC(=O)OCC. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be approximately 0.005.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.09811908185314243
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we can look at the example ClCCCl, which has a property value of -0.15561921. The molecule ClCCl is similar but has one less carbon atom. Generally, reducing the size of a molecule by removing a carbon atom can lead to a slight decrease in the property value, especially if the property is related to molecular size or mass.

Given this reasoning, the predicted property value for ClCCl would likely be slightly lower than -0.15561921. A reasonable estimate might be around -0.20.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a simple aromatic compound with a hydroxyl group (phenol derivative), similar to some of the examples given.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is structurally similar to the example Oc1cccc(O)c1, which has a property value of 0.42929984. Both molecules are phenol derivatives, but Cc1cccc(C)c1O has an additional methyl group, which might slightly alter the property value.

Considering the structural similarity and the effect of the additional methyl group, the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is likely to be close to that of Oc1cccc(O)c1, but slightly lower due to the additional methyl group potentially reducing the overall polarity or other contributing factors.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be approximately 0.35.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated biphenyl, which is similar to the chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.

From the examples, we observe that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have higher property values. For instance:
- Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 13.10321377.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 17.64859782.

The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a biphenyl with four chlorine atoms, similar to the second example, which has a high property value due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms.

Based on this pattern, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is likely to be high, similar to the other highly chlorinated biphenyls. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 17.64859782, as it closely resembles the structure of the second example.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.632114260857026
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple hydrocarbon with a branched structure and a double bond.

Looking at the examples, we can see that simple hydrocarbons with similar structures, such as alkanes and alkenes, tend to have property values around 0. For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCC (octane) has a property value of 0.06383161, and the molecule CCCCCCCC=C (1-octene) has a property value of 1.16028864.

Given that isoprene is a small, branched alkene, we can expect its property value to be closer to that of other small alkenes. Considering the examples and the nature of isoprene, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be slightly positive, reflecting its unsaturation and small size.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC=C(C)C is approximately 0.5.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.09811908185314243
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of chlorine atoms and the overall structure of the molecule.

In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, have very high property values (28.6728038), while simpler chlorinated compounds like ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl have lower values (-0.33215662). The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, but the specific structure and connectivity also play a significant role.

Given that ClCCl is a simple molecule with two chlorine atoms, we can expect its property value to be relatively low compared to more complex chlorinated compounds. However, it should be higher than non-chlorinated or less chlorinated compounds.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around -0.3.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.04164613519797125
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

In the examples, we have a similar molecule: Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which is 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, with a property value of 0.04164614. Given the structural similarity and the presence of the same functional groups (hydroxyl and multiple chloro groups on a benzene ring), it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl will be very close to this value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is approximately 0.04164614.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 0.021886432661643165
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule appears to be complex, with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and a significant degree of oxygenation, which suggests a high degree of polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, the molecule is likely to have a relatively high property value, similar to those of other complex, oxygen-rich structures in the examples. The presence of multiple aromatic systems and ether linkages also suggests a potential for a higher property value.

Based on these considerations and the examples provided, I would predict a property value in the range of 10 to 15. A reasonable specific prediction for this molecule could be approximately 12.5.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 2.188299969316233
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of the thiosemicarbazide moiety suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and polar interactions, which could influence the property value. The tert-butyl group is a bulky, non-polar group that might reduce the overall polarity of the molecule.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar functional groups or structural motifs can provide insight. For instance, CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a similar tert-butyl group and a heterocyclic nitrogen-containing ring, and its property value is 0.56811667. Another example, C1SC(=S)NC1(=O), which contains sulfur and nitrogen in a ring, has a property value of 2.93526542.

Considering these comparisons, the presence of the thiosemicarbazide moiety and the tert-butyl group, the predicted property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to the example with the tert-butyl group and heterocyclic nitrogen-containing ring.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is approximately 0.57.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.5626984199596033
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically ethyl benzoate, which consists of a benzene ring attached to an ester functional group.

Looking at the examples, we can find a similar structure: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2, which has a property value of 0.29513406. This molecule also contains an ester group attached to a benzene ring, although it has additional functional groups that could affect the property value.

Another similar structure is CCC(C)CO, which has a property value of 0.57009978. This molecule is a simple alcohol, and its property value is higher than that of the more complex ester with additional functional groups.

Considering the simplicity of ethyl benzoate compared to the more complex ester with additional functional groups, we can predict that the property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 will be closer to the simpler structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately 0.3.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.04057565255451482
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and shape of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached. In the examples, linear alkyl chains such as CCCCCCCCO have a property value of -0.61875483, and CCCCCCC=C has a value of -0.24583855. The presence of a bromine atom, as seen in Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, has a property value of 0.47107653, indicating that bromine can increase the property value compared to similar structures without bromine.

Considering these observations, the presence of the bromine atom in CCCCCCCBr is likely to increase the property value compared to a similar alkyl chain without bromine. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr would be slightly higher than that of a similar alkyl chain without bromine, such as CCCCCCCCO.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr is approximately -0.2.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 4.893866787481261
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for carbon monoxide (CO) based on the examples provided is challenging due to the lack of a clear pattern or specific property type (e.g., solubility, boiling point, etc.) being measured. However, given the range of values and the types of molecules listed, it seems the property might be related to a molecular descriptor or a calculated property.

Carbon monoxide is a small, simple molecule with a linear structure and a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is quite different from the larger, more complex molecules in the examples. Based on the examples, smaller and simpler molecules tend to have property values closer to zero, often negative.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO might be around -0.1. However, this is a speculative estimate given the lack of specific context for the property being measured.
