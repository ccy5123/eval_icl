Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxygen and a nitrogen atom. This structure is similar to some of the other aromatic and heterocyclic compounds in the examples, particularly those with negative property values.

For instance, the molecule c1cncnc1 has a property value of -0.85386083, and it is a simple aromatic heterocycle.

True Property: -0.6851969620079699
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) attached to a nitro group (N(=O)=O). The presence of the nitro group is significant because it is an electron-withdrawing group, which can influence the molecule's properties.

Looking at the examples, we can find a similar structure: Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, which has a nitro group attached to a carbon chain. This molecule has a property value of -0.42544802. Another example with a nitro group is CNc2cnn(c1cccc(c1)C(F)(F)F)c(=O)c2Cl, which has a property value of 1.13913995, but this molecule is more complex and contains additional electron-withdrawing groups.

Given the simplicity of the isopropyl nitrite structure compared to the examples, and considering the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group, the property value is likely to be negative, similar to Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.425.

- C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13, with a property value of 1.36248781

The presence of carbonyl groups and the overall complexity of the structure suggest that the property value might be influenced by these features. The examples with similar polycyclic structures and carbonyl groups tend to have positive property values, often above 1.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 1.5. However, given the complexity and the presence of multiple carbonyl groups, it might be slightly higher. Therefore, a more precise prediction would be:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A benzene ring with two fluorine atoms (Fc1cccc(F)c1), similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.84579.

- A chlorinated benzene ring (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -0.0.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of electron-withdrawing groups (fluorine and chlorine) and the amide linkage suggest a negative property value. The combination of these features, particularly the similarity to the FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 and Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 examples, leads to a prediction of a property value close to those examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 is approximately -0.84579.

The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and shape of the molecule.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with a linear chain and a branching methyl group. In the examples, similar small, linear, or slightly branched aliphatic molecules with ether or alcohol functionalities tend to have property values around 0.4 to 0.5. For instance, CCCCCO and CCCCCC1CCCC1 both have property values of 0.42165967 and 0.54025145, respectively.

Based on this pattern, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is likely to be around 0.42165967.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Alkyl Chain**: The molecule has a propyl group (CCC(C)) attached to the pyrrole ring. Alkyl chains generally contribute to a moderate increase in the property value, as seen in examples like CCC(C)CC (0.54025145) and CCC(C)CCO (0.42165967).

2. **Pyrrole Ring**: The presence of a pyrrole ring, which is a five-membered aromatic heterocycle, can influence the property value. Pyrrole rings are present in some examples, such as Nc1nccs1 (-0.65209009), which is a thiophene, but similar in being a five-membered heterocycle.

3. **Carbonyl Groups**: The molecule has two carbonyl groups (C=O), which can have a significant impact on the property value. Carbonyl groups are polar and can decrease the property value, as seen in examples like O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC (-0.49001465).

4. **Bromine Atom**: The presence of a bromine atom can increase the property value due to its size and polarizability. This is evident in examples like CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OC(C#N)c2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2 (3.1545414) and CCCCCCBr (2.37447101).

Considering these factors, the molecule has a mix of features that both increase and decrease the property value. The alkyl chain and bromine atom suggest an increase, while the carbonyl groups suggest a decrease. The overall effect is likely to be a moderate property value.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O would be around 0.5. However, given the presence of the bromine atom and the specific arrangement of functional groups, the value might be slightly higher.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule is approximately **0.7**.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.1792053592943934
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of aromatic rings and other functional groups.

Biphenyl consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples, molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34, which has multiple aromatic rings, has a property value of 3.46880962. Another example, c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67, which is a highly conjugated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a very high property value of 7.11814229.

Given that biphenyl is a relatively simple structure with two aromatic rings, its property value is likely to be lower than those of more complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but higher than those of simpler or non-aromatic structures.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around 0.5 to 1.0. However, considering the specific examples and their values, a more precise prediction would be approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the examples provided and identify patterns or trends in the data. The examples include various types of molecules with different functional groups and structural features, and their associated property values.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear alkane chain with a sulfur atom at the end. In the examples, linear alkanes such as CCCCCCC=C (with a double bond) have a property value of -0.13638055, and CCCCCCC(C)C (a branched alkane) has a property value of 0.54025145. The presence of sulfur in CCCCCS introduces a heteroatom, which can affect the property value.

Considering the examples, molecules with sulfur, such as COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O, have a property value of 0.72802177. However, this molecule is more complex than CCCCCS. Simpler molecules with sulfur, like CCNC(=S)NCC, have a property value of -0.24097191.

Given the simplicity of CCCCCS compared to the more complex sulfur-containing molecules, and considering the trend for linear alkanes, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the sulfur atom.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCS is approximately -0.13638055.

True Property: -0.8457899999785877
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group is a significant factor, as it is highly electronegative and can influence the molecule's properties.

Looking at the examples, we see that molecules with halogen substitutions on aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1 (1.36248781) and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (1.13913995), tend to have positive property values. The trifluoromethyl group is similar in its electron-withdrawing nature to these halogen groups, suggesting that the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 might also be positive.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around 1.0, given the influence of the trifluoromethyl group and the aromatic ring. However, without exact data, this is an estimation based on the trends observed in the examples.

Looking at the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a property value of -0.09223805. This suggests that the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups tends to result in a negative property value, likely due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding potential.

Given the structural similarity of OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O to OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O will be similar.

From the examples, molecules with polar and electron-withdrawing groups, such as sulfonamides and halogens, tend to have higher property values. However, the presence of electron-donating groups like amines can moderate this effect.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a moderate to high property value due to the combination of polar groups and aromaticity. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 would be around 0.5.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 4.075768948290198
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O

This molecule contains several notable features:

1. **Nitro Groups (N(=O)=O):** The presence of nitro groups is significant as they are electron-withdrawing and can influence the electronic properties of the molecule. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as "Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O" and "Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O", have property values of -0.13638055 and 4.54222996, respectively. The latter has a much higher value due to additional structural complexity and other functional groups.

2. **Trifluoromethyl Group (C(F)(F)F):** This group is also electron-withdrawing and can affect the molecule's properties. In the examples, molecules with halogens, such as "ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl" and "Brc1ccccc1", have property values of -0.4084828 and -0.22071248, respectively.

3. **Aromatic Ring:** The presence of an aromatic ring is common in many of the examples, and it can contribute to the stability and electronic properties of the molecule.

4. **Alkyl Chain with a Double Bond (CC(C)=C):** This feature is less common in the examples but can contribute to the overall hydrophobicity and steric effects.

Considering these features, the molecule has multiple electron-withdrawing groups, which generally lead to lower property values. However, the presence of the trifluoromethyl group and the overall complexity of the molecule could increase the property value compared to simpler nitro-containing compounds.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around -0.13638055, similar to other nitro-containing aromatic compounds with additional electron-withdrawing groups. However, due to the complexity and additional groups, the value might be slightly higher, but still negative.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule is approximately:

-0.13638055

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.6033356903449983
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. 

From the examples, we can observe that simple esters like CCC(C)(C)O and CCC(C)(C)OC=O have property values around 0.42165967. Additionally, the molecule CC(C)CCOC=O, which is a similar ester, has a property value of -0.60333569. 

Considering the structural similarity of CC(C)OC=O to these examples, particularly to CC(C)CCOC=O, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC(C)OC=O would be close to -0.60333569. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O is approximately -0.60333569.

True Property: -0.8479312404848627
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is structurally similar to c1ccccc1O (phenol), which has a property value of -0.84793124. The presence of additional methyl groups in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 could slightly alter the property value, but given the examples, the effect of methyl groups on aromatic rings tends to be relatively small.

Considering the examples and the structural similarity to phenol, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be close to that of phenol. Therefore, I would predict the property value to be approximately -0.84793124, with a slight adjustment for the methyl groups, leading to a predicted value of around -0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is present in several examples with high property values, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl (3.20609588), COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl (4.60201998), and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (2.2828918). These examples suggest that the presence of the phosphorothioate group contributes significantly to the property value.

Additionally, the molecule contains a methoxy group (OC) and a thiomethyl group (SC), which are not directly present in the examples but can be considered as electron-donating groups. The presence of these groups might slightly reduce the property value compared to the examples with halogens, which are electron-withdrawing.

Considering these factors, the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be lower than the examples with halogens but still relatively high due to the phosphorothioate group. A reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 2.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we can observe that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have higher property values. For instance:
- ClC(Cl)Cl has a property value of 4.42363818.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1.13913995.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 2.3285167.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is similar to the last example, with a similar level of chlorination and aromatic structure. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be close to that of Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which is 2.3285167.

Thus, the predicted property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately 2.3285167.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6851969620079699
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a nitroalkane, specifically a nitropropane. The nitro group (N(=O)=O) is known to have a significant impact on the properties of organic molecules, often increasing their polarity and potentially their reactivity.

Looking at the examples, we can see that molecules with nitro groups, such as CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, tend to have higher property values, often positive. However, these examples also contain additional aromatic or electron-withdrawing groups that can further influence the property value.

In contrast, simpler aliphatic molecules like CCC (propane) have a property value of 0.54025145, and the presence of a nitro group would likely increase this value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCN(=O)=O is likely to be positive but not as high as those with multiple nitro groups or additional aromatic systems. A reasonable prediction, based on the trend observed, would be around 1.0 to 2.0.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O could be approximately:

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.35561063484980926
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent. 

Looking at the examples, we have:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 with a property value of 0.51010937
- c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12 with a property value of -0.83738975

The presence of a halogen (Br) on an aromatic ring seems to have varying effects on the property value, depending on the specific structure and other substituents. The presence of a fluorine atom (F) in the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar to the presence of chlorine in Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, which has a positive property value. However, the specific combination of F and Br in the same aromatic ring is not directly represented in the examples.

Considering the examples and the potential influence of the fluorine and bromine substituents, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be slightly positive, similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but potentially lower due to the different electronegativity and size of fluorine compared to chlorine.

Therefore, a predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 could be approximately 0.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to analyze its structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with an additional methyl group and a hydroxyl group. This structure is similar to some of the cyclic and bicyclic compounds in the examples, such as CC1CCCO1 (0.42165967) and CC1(C)C(C=C(Cl)Cl)C1C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2 (0.96207583), although the latter is more complex.

Given the presence of the alcohol group, which can influence the polarity and hydrogen bonding, and the overall bicyclic structure, the property value is likely to be influenced by these factors. The examples with alcohol groups, such as CCCC(C)(C)O (0.42165967) and CC(C)(C)CO (0.42165967), suggest a positive property value.

Considering these aspects, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 would be around 0.42165967, similar to other alcohol-containing cyclic compounds in the examples.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)
- An amide linkage (N2C(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)

Comparing this structure to the examples:
- The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O has a similar phosphorothioate group and an amide linkage with a phenyl ring, and its property value is -0.45839018.
- The presence of the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage with a phenyl ring suggests that the property value might be similar to the example with a similar structure.

Based on this analysis, the predicted property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is approximately -0.45839018.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule "Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O" which has a property value of 2.85213235. Both molecules contain aromatic rings and nitrogen heterocycles, but the example molecule is more complex with additional aromatic rings and a more extended conjugated system.

Given the structural similarities but recognizing the simpler structure of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we can predict a property value that is lower than 2.85213235 but still positive due to the presence of aromatic and heterocyclic features.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around 1.5.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCC, a linear alkane with 5 carbon atoms, has a property value of 0.54025145.
- CCCCCCCCI, a linear alkane with 8 carbon atoms and an iodine atom, has a property value of 3.63039092.
- CCCCCCCC(=O)OC, an ester with 8 carbon atoms, has a property value of -0.60333569.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar to CCCCCCCC(=O)OC, but with one additional carbon in the chain, making it a 9-carbon ester. The property value for CCCCCCCC(=O)OC is -0.60333569, and adding one more carbon typically does not drastically change the property value for similar types of molecules.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is likely to be close to -0.60333569. Given the trend and the nature of the molecule, a reasonable prediction would be:

-0.60333569

To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is methyl benzoate, which is an ester derived from benzoic acid.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Esters like CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 have a property value of -0.28050251.
- Another ester, CC(C)OC(=O)C, has a property value of -0.60333569.
- The ester CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, which is very similar to the molecule in question, has a property value of -0.60333569.

Given the structural similarity of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 will be close to -0.60333569.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.60333569.

True Property: -0.5903235364991738
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are likely related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups, conjugation, and possibly the overall molecular size or shape.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear conjugated diene, which is a relatively simple structure. In the examples, simple alkenes and small hydrocarbons tend to have property values around zero or slightly negative. For instance, the molecule CC/C=C/C has a property value of -0.13638055, and CCC(=O)C has a property value of -0.28050251.

Given the simplicity and the conjugated nature of C=CCC=C, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would be slightly negative, similar to other small hydrocarbons and alkenes in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C is approximately -0.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is tribromomethane, also known as bromoform. It is a simple molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples provided, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly bromine, tend to have property values that are positive and relatively high compared to simpler hydrocarbons or molecules with fewer halogens.

For instance, the molecule FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br has a property value of 2.75396471, which is relatively high, likely due to the presence of multiple halogens. Similarly, the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.22680678, which is also positive, reflecting the influence of multiple chlorine atoms.

Given that BrC(Br)Br is a simple molecule with three bromine atoms, we can expect its property value to be positive and potentially higher than simpler molecules with fewer halogens. However, it is likely to be lower than the more complex halogenated molecules in the examples.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around 1.5. This value reflects the influence of the three bromine atoms while considering the simplicity of the molecule compared to more complex halogenated structures.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S) with ethoxy groups (OCC).
- A thioester linkage (SC).
- A chloro-substituted carbon (CCl).
- An imide group (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O), which is a cyclic structure with a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with halogen substitutions, especially multiple chlorines, tend to have positive property values (e.g., Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, 1.92975183).
- Molecules with aromatic rings and additional functional groups like carbonyls or imides can have a range of values, but often lean towards positive if they have electron-withdrawing groups or halogens (e.g., OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O, 0.66411398).

Considering the structure of the given molecule, it has both electron-withdrawing groups (chlorine, carbonyls) and a phosphorothioate group, which can contribute to a positive property value. The presence of the aromatic ring and the imide group also suggests a potential for a positive value, similar to other aromatic-containing examples.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 0.5 to 1.0. Given the specific examples and the structural features, a predicted value could be approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A tertiary amide group (CN(C)C(=O)N).
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)).
- A heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen (n2nc(oc2=O)).
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C).

From the examples, we observe:
- Molecules with chlorinated aromatic rings often have negative property values, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-0.80625941) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (1.92975183).
- Molecules with amide groups also tend to have negative property values, such as CN(C)C(=O)C (-0.60333569) and CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C (-0.79440023).
- The presence of heterocyclic rings with nitrogen and oxygen can vary in their influence, but they often contribute to a negative or slightly positive property value, as seen in Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2 (0.20028834) and Cc2cccc3sc1nncn1c23 (-0.44208381).

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value due to the combination of the chlorinated aromatic ring, the amide group, and the heterocyclic ring. The tert-butyl group may slightly offset this negativity, but not significantly.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be approximately -0.7.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with three chlorine atoms attached to the rings. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, which has a property value of 1.13913995. However, the example molecule is a tetrachlorobenzene, while the target molecule is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether.

The presence of the ether linkage and the additional phenyl ring in the target molecule could potentially lower the property value compared to the tetrachlorobenzene example, as the ether linkage might reduce the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorines compared to having all chlorines on a single benzene ring.

Considering these structural differences and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be slightly lower than 1.13913995. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.9.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC/C=C\C, we can look at the examples provided and identify similar structures and their corresponding property values. The molecule CC/C=C\C is a simple linear alkene, specifically 2-butene.

In the examples, the molecule CC/C=C/C, which is also 2-butene but with a different stereochemistry (trans vs. cis), has a property value of -0.13638055. Since the stereochemistry (cis vs. trans) can affect the property value, but the core structure is the same, we can reasonably predict that the property value for CC/C=C\C (cis-2-butene) will be very close to that of the trans isomer.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C is approximately -0.13638055.

These molecules have similar structural features to CCCOCC, which is also an ether with a similar level of complexity and functional group presence.

Based on this analysis, the predicted property value for CCCOCC is likely to be close to 0.42165967. Therefore, the predicted specific property value for CCCOCC is:

This structure is similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 2.75396471. Both molecules contain a tertiary amide linkage and two phenyl rings, which suggests that they might have similar electronic and steric properties.

Given the structural similarities, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 will be close to that of the similar example. Therefore, the predicted property value for this molecule is approximately 2.75396471.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is an acetanilide derivative with a bromine substituent on the phenyl ring. This structure is somewhat similar to other aromatic compounds with halogen substituents and amide groups in the examples.

- The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 has a property value of -0.35561063. This molecule is a halogenated benzene, similar to the brominated phenyl ring in our target molecule.
- The molecule Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 has a property value of -0.0. This is another halogenated benzene, but with two chlorine atoms.
- The molecule Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of -0.56331096. This is a brominated phenol, which is similar in terms of having a bromine on the phenyl ring.

Considering the presence of the acetamide group (CC(=O)N) in the target molecule, we should also consider the influence of amide groups:

- The molecule CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 has a property value of 1.40086542. This molecule contains an amide group attached to aromatic rings, similar to our target molecule.

Taking into account the structural similarities and the influence of both the bromine substituent and the amide group, the property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to be slightly negative, as seen in other halogenated aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately -0.4.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is isobutylbenzene, which consists of an isobutyl group (CC(C)C) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1).

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) tend to have negative property values, often around -0.8 to -0.9, such as Cc1ccccc1N (-0.84793124) and Cc1ccnc(C)c1 (-0.84579).
- Molecules with alkyl chains attached to benzene rings, such as CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.82157751) and CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.82157751), also have property values around -0.82.

Given these observations, the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, which is similar in structure to the examples with alkyl chains attached to benzene rings, is likely to have a property value close to -0.82.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is approximately -0.82157751.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.7944002278279901
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have positive property values, while those with electron-donating groups or less polar groups tend to have negative property values. Benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, but not as strongly as nitro groups.

Comparing benzaldehyde to similar structures in the examples, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (-0.28050251) and O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O (0.99682981), we can infer that the property value for benzaldehyde is likely to be negative but closer to zero than the nitro-substituted benzene.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) would be around -0.2.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 4.423638175155778
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, similar to the first example (Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2) which has a property value of 0.36434031.
- An aromatic ring with a heteroatom (oxygen), similar to the example Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 with a property value of -0.7056211.
- A cyclic imide structure (O=C2CN...C(=O)N2), which is not directly represented in the examples but can be related to amide or lactam structures.

Considering these features, the molecule has a combination of electron-withdrawing groups (nitro group) and aromaticity, which tend to lower the property value, as seen in several examples with negative values. However, the presence of the cyclic imide might slightly increase the value compared to simple aromatic nitro compounds.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.5. This value reflects the influence of the nitro group and aromaticity, balanced by the cyclic imide structure.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.9276512716415565
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, where two phenyl rings are connected through a hydrazine (N-N) linkage.

From the examples, we have:

- N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 with a property value of 0.92765127. This molecule is an azo compound with two phenyl rings connected through a nitrogen double bond (N=N).
- Nc1ccccc1 with a property value of -0.84793124. This is an aniline, a single phenyl ring with an amino group.

The molecule in question, N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, is structurally similar to the azo compound but with a single bond (N-N) instead of a double bond (N=N). The presence of the N-N linkage instead of N=N might slightly reduce the property value compared to the azo compound due to differences in electronic properties and resonance stabilization.

Considering these factors, the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be slightly lower than that of the azo compound but higher than that of the aniline. A reasonable estimate would be around 0.8.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a relatively small and compact structure with two amide bonds and a cyclohexane ring. In the examples, similar cyclic structures with amide bonds, such as O=C1N(COC(=O)CC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3, have relatively high property values, but those examples also contain aromatic rings which contribute to higher values.

The closest example in terms of structure is O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, which is also a cyclic structure with amide bonds and has a property value of -0.49001465. Given the structural similarity, particularly the presence of the diketopiperazine core, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be in a similar range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately -0.49001465.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values. For instance, ClC(Br)Br has a property value of 6.90220642, and Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a property value of 0.22680678.
- The presence of aromatic rings, as seen in biphenyl structures, can also influence the property value. For example, Clc1ccccc1Cl has a property value of -0.0.

Considering these observations, the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has three chlorine atoms and a biphenyl structure, which suggests a relatively high property value compared to simpler chlorinated benzenes. However, it is likely lower than the highly chlorinated and brominated example (ClC(Br)Br).

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 0.5.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:

1. Simple aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions, such as Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) and Cc1ccccn1 (pyridine), have property values around -0.84793124 and -0.84579, respectively.
2. Linear alkanes and simple ethers, such as CCCCCCC(=O)OC and CCCCCCCCCC, have property values around -0.60333569 and 0.42165967, respectively.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a relatively simple aromatic compound with alkyl substitutions, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar to those of other simple aromatic compounds with alkyl groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is approximately -0.84579.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is a para-substituted aniline with a sulfonamide group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a nitro group instead of a sulfonamide group. The property value for the nitro-substituted aniline is -0.13638055.

The sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is generally less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group (N(=O)=O), which might suggest a slightly less negative property value compared to the nitro-substituted aniline.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be slightly less negative than -0.13638055. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.1.

Looking at the examples, we see that similar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12, have a property value of 2.46736791, and c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 has a property value of 3.79493702.

Given that the molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 is structurally similar to these examples, we can infer that its property value will be in a similar range. Since it is a highly conjugated system with multiple aromatic rings, it is likely to have a relatively high property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 would be approximately 3.79493702, as it closely resembles the structure of the example with that property value.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the more complex aromatic structures in the examples, particularly those with multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings, which tend to have higher property values.

For instance, the molecule Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 has a property value of 8.24229355, and it shares some structural similarities with the target molecule, such as the presence of multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups.

Considering these structural similarities and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 is likely to be relatively high. A reasonable estimate for the property value would be around 8.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)O), an amide group (NC(C)=O), and a thiol group (SC). The presence of these functional groups can influence the property value.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (property value: 2.2828918) and CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C (property value: 1.97274135), tend to have positive property values. However, the presence of additional functional groups like amides and thiols can affect the overall property.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, the property value is likely to be positive but not as high as the examples with more complex aromatic systems.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around 1.5.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, symmetrical molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, tend to have positive property values. Additionally, smaller and more symmetrical molecules often have higher property values compared to larger, more complex structures.

Considering these factors, the property value for Cl\C=C/Cl is likely to be positive and relatively high compared to other small molecules with fewer chlorine atoms. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be approximately 1.13913995, similar to other chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.

- A pyridine-like structure (ccnc)

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens (like Cl) tend to have positive property values.
- Molecules with amide linkages and aromatic rings can have varying property values, often slightly negative or close to zero.
- The presence of an ester linkage in some examples (e.g., CCOC(=O)CC) is associated with negative property values.

Considering these observations, the molecule in question has a combination of features that could lead to a property value that is slightly positive due to the presence of the chlorinated aromatic ring and the pyridine-like structure, but also slightly negative due to the ester and amide linkages.

Balancing these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 would be around 0.1.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a sulfonamide with a benzene ring, a carbonyl group, and an ether linkage. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Sulfonamide Group (S(=O)(=O)N)**: This functional group is known for its electron-withdrawing properties, which can influence the overall electronic distribution in the molecule.

2. **Benzene Ring (c2ccccc2)**: Aromatic rings are common in the examples, and they often contribute to the electronic properties of the molecule.

3. **Carbonyl Group (C=O)**: This is another electron-withdrawing group, which can affect the molecule's polarity and reactivity.

4. **Ether Linkage (CCO1)**: This part of the molecule can contribute to the overall polarity and solubility.

Comparing with the examples:

- Molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like carbonyls and sulfonamides) tend to have negative property values, as seen in examples like CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C (-0.85320199) and CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-0.84051925).

- The presence of a sulfonamide group, similar to the phosphorothioate group in the examples, suggests a strong electron-withdrawing effect, which typically results in a negative property value.

Based on these observations, the predicted property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is likely to be negative and in the range of the examples with similar functional groups. A reasonable prediction would be around -0.8, considering the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonamide and carbonyl groups.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several functional groups and structural features that can influence its property value:

1. **Ester Groups (COC(=O))**: Esters are present in the molecule, which can contribute to a moderate property value. In the examples, esters are associated with both positive and negative values, depending on the context.

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The presence of a nitro group is significant. In the examples, nitro groups are often associated with higher property values, as seen in molecules like CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O (2.70537502).

3. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: Aromatic rings are common in the examples and can contribute to both positive and negative values. The context and additional substituents on the ring are crucial.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring (C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1...))**: The presence of a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen can influence the property value. In the examples, heterocycles with nitrogen, such as c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2, have negative values.

5. **Substituents and Overall Structure**: The combination of these features, along with the specific arrangement and additional substituents, will determine the overall property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule has a complex structure with both electron-withdrawing (nitro group) and electron-donating (methoxy and methyl groups) features. The presence of multiple functional groups and aromatic systems suggests a property value that is likely to be positive, influenced by the nitro group and the overall molecular complexity.

Based on the analysis and comparison with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around:

**1.21227155**

This value is chosen considering the influence of the nitro group and the ester functionalities, as well as the overall structural complexity.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two amide groups and a cyclohexane-like structure due to the cyclization of the peptide bond. This structure is somewhat similar to other cyclic or heterocyclic compounds in the examples, such as the diketopiperazine-like structures or other cyclic amides.

Looking at the examples, we see that molecules with amide groups and cyclic structures tend to have negative property values, often in the range of -0.5 to -0.8. For instance, the molecule ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of -0.5349807, and it contains amide groups and a cyclic structure.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.5. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the examples provided and look for patterns or similarities. The examples include various types of molecules with different functional groups and structures, and their associated property values.

The molecule ClCC is a simple chloroalkane, specifically chloroethane. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons like CCCCC (pentane) have a property value of 0.54025145, while aromatic compounds with chlorine, such as Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene), have a property value of -0.54931055. The presence of chlorine in a molecule often results in a negative property value, as seen in several examples.

Considering the simplicity of ClCC and the presence of a chlorine atom, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly negative, similar to other small chlorinated compounds. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be around -0.5. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCC is approximately -0.5.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values. For instance, ClCC(Cl)Cl has a property value of 4.42363818, and BrC(Cl)Cl has a property value of 5.60346169. However, these molecules are smaller and have fewer aromatic features compared to the target molecule.

The molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, which is similar in having a trichloromethyl group attached to an aromatic ring, has a property value of 0.22680678. The presence of a nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring of the target molecule might slightly alter the property value compared to a purely carbon-based aromatic ring.

Considering these factors, the property value for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is likely to be close to that of Clc1ccc(cc1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, but potentially slightly higher due to the presence of the nitrogen atom, which can influence electronic properties.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- CCCCCCCCl (a seven-carbon chain with a chlorine atom) has a property value of 1.55767011.
- CCCCCCC#C (a seven-carbon chain with a triple bond) has a property value of -0.47436713.
- CCCC(O)CCC (a six-carbon chain with a hydroxyl group) has a property value of 0.42165967.
- CCC(C)CCO (a five-carbon chain with a hydroxyl group) has a property value of 0.42165967.

The molecule CCCCC(C)O is similar to CCC(C)CCO in terms of structure, as both are secondary alcohols with similar carbon chain lengths. Given that CCC(C)CCO has a property value of 0.42165967, it is reasonable to predict that CCCCC(C)O will have a similar property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCC(C)O is approximately 0.42165967.

From the examples, we can observe that halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have higher property values. For instance:

- ClCCl (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of 2.85213235.
- ClC(Cl)Cl (chloroform) has a property value of 4.42363818.
- ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl (carbon tetrachloride) has a property value of 6.27218758.
- CI (iodomethane) has a property value of 3.63039092.

These examples suggest that the presence of halogens, especially multiple halogens, significantly increases the property value. Given that 1,4-dibromobenzene has two bromine atoms, which are heavier and more polarizable than chlorine, we can expect a relatively high property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around 4.0. However, since bromine is heavier than chlorine, the value might be slightly higher than that of similar chlorinated compounds. Therefore, a more precise prediction would be approximately 4.5.

The molecule in question is a chlorinated biphenyl, similar to the example Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 7.55890841. The given molecule has a similar structure but with fewer chlorine atoms.

Given that the property values seem to increase with the number of chlorine atoms and the degree of chlorination, we can expect the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl to be slightly lower than 7.55890841 due to having fewer chlorine atoms.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately 7.0.

SMILES: Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1
True Property: 4.423638175155772
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1

This molecule contains:

1. Aromatic rings: Three phenyl rings, which are common in the examples.
2. Phosphoryl group: OP(=O), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in some examples.
3. Alkyl groups: Methyl groups attached to the aromatic rings.

From the examples, we observe that:

- Molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro or carbonyl) tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with alkyl chains or non-polar groups tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of phosphorus-containing groups (like phosphorothioate) can lead to higher property values, as seen in the example with a value of 7.04583424.

Considering these factors, the presence of the phosphoryl group and the aromatic rings suggests a property value that is likely positive but not as high as the example with the phosphorothioate group. The structure is more complex than simple hydrocarbons but less so than the highly positive example.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to be electron-withdrawing and can increase the molecule's polarity.
- An aromatic ring, which is common in many of the examples.
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle, specifically a piperidine-like structure with a ketone group, which can influence the molecule's electronic properties.

From the examples, molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (NO2) or multiple halogens (Cl, F) tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule ClC1=C(Cl)C(Cl)(C(=C1Cl)Cl)C2(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C(=C2Cl)Cl)Cl has a very high property value of 11.87564927, likely due to the extensive halogenation.

Considering the presence of the CF3 group and the chlorinated piperidine ring, the molecule is likely to have a relatively high property value compared to those with fewer electron-withdrawing groups or less complex structures.

Based on these observations, I would predict a property value in the range of 2 to 3, as it is more similar to the examples with multiple halogens and complex structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O would be approximately:

True Property: -0.13638054916889425
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is a nitrobenzene derivative with a methoxy group, which can be represented as a methoxybenzene (anisole) with a nitro group attached.

From the examples, we can identify some relevant patterns:
- Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to increase the property value, as seen in O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O with a property value of 0.99682981.
- Methoxy groups (OCH3) are present in CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2 with a property value of 1.84476105, indicating a potential increase in the property value.
- The presence of aromatic rings (phenyl groups) generally contributes to a moderate property value, as seen in c1ccccc1O with a property value of -0.84793124.

Considering these factors, the combination of a methoxy group and a nitro group on a benzene ring suggests a property value that is likely positive, given the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group and the electron-donating nature of the methoxy group.

Based on these observations and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around 0.99682981, similar to the other nitro-containing aromatic compound in the examples.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 10.80041711. Both molecules are heavily chlorinated, which significantly increases their property values due to the high electronegativity and molecular weight of chlorine atoms.

Given the structural similarity and the high degree of chlorination, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl will also be very high, likely in the same range as the example provided.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is approximately 10.80041711.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCOC=O is a simple ester, specifically propyl formate.

From the examples, we can observe that simple linear aliphatic compounds, such as alkanes and alkynes, tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCC#C has a property value of -0.47436713, and CCCCC#C also has a property value of -0.47436713. On the other hand, compounds with functional groups like esters, amides, and others can have a range of property values, often closer to zero or slightly positive.

Given that CCCOC=O is a small ester, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be close to zero, similar to other small molecules with functional groups. For example, NC(=O)N has a property value of -0.79440023, and CCCCCC=C has a property value of -0.13638055.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be slightly negative, but close to zero. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately -0.2 for CCCOC=O.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a long-chain ester, specifically a decanoate ester, which is similar in structure to other aliphatic esters and long-chain hydrocarbons.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Long-chain hydrocarbons and esters tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCCCCCC(=O)OCC (octanoate ester) would likely have a similar property value.
- The molecule CCCCC=C(CC)C=O has a property value of -0.67449076, which is a long-chain aldehyde.
- The molecule CCOC has a property value of 0.42165967, which is a short-chain ether.

Considering the structure of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, it is more similar to long-chain hydrocarbons and esters, which tend to have negative property values. Therefore, I would predict a negative property value for this molecule.

Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be approximately -0.5.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to the aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have negative property values (-0.80625941).
- Molecules with phenol groups, such as Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1, also have negative property values (-0.29977367).
- The presence of chlorine atoms in aromatic rings tends to contribute to negative property values, as seen in Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl (-0.80625941).

Considering these observations, the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of the nitro group, phenol group, and chlorine atoms.

Based on the trends from the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately -0.80625941, similar to other molecules with nitro and chlorine groups.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O) attached to aromatic rings. In the examples, the presence of phosphorothioate groups, as seen in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, is associated with a positive property value (0.25365464). Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings with substituents like sulfur-containing groups (e.g., thiol or thioether) can also influence the property value.

Given the structural complexity and the presence of multiple phosphorothioate groups, which tend to increase the property value, we can predict that the property value for this molecule will be positive and likely higher than the example with a single phosphorothioate group.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 would be around 1.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can identify similar structures and their property values:

1. Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (a nitrobenzene derivative) has a property value of -0.50533276.
2. Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 (a chlorinated aniline) has a property value of -0.76672881.
3. Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1 (a complex aromatic compound with phosphates) has a property value of 4.42363818.

The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is more similar to the first example, Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, as both contain a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring. The presence of the hydroxyl group in Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O may slightly alter the property value compared to the nitrobenzene derivative, but it is likely to remain in a similar range.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be around -0.505, similar to the nitrobenzene derivative. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is:

-0.505

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule appears to be a complex carbohydrate, likely a polysaccharide or a derivative, characterized by multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages.

From the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, such as sugars and sugar derivatives, tend to have property values around zero or slightly positive. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, which is a simple sugar, has a property value of 0.0.

From the examples, we can observe that simple linear alkanes and alkenes, such as CCCC(O)CCC and CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO, have property values around 0.42165967. The presence of a triple bond in CCC#C might slightly alter this value, but given the simplicity and linearity of the molecule, it is reasonable to predict a property value close to those of similar linear hydrocarbons.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCC#C is approximately 0.42165967.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 0.25365464.
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl, which has a property value of 0.82635412, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 1.13913995.

Considering these structural similarities, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring tends to increase the property value, while the phosphorothioate group contributes a moderate positive value. Balancing these factors, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be around 0.5 to 1.0.

Given the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately:

Both molecules contain nitrogen heterocycles and carbonyl groups, which can influence the property value.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of the carbonyl and nitrogen groups, the predicted property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is likely to be close to that of Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be approximately 0.57.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Several alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with halogens, especially multiple chlorines or bromines, tend to have higher property values.
- Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) often have positive property values.
- Molecules with aromatic rings and certain functional groups (e.g., nitro, halogens) tend to have negative property values.
- Simple aliphatic chains or cyclic alkanes without additional functional groups tend to have property values closer to zero or slightly negative.

The molecule in question does not have any halogens or nitro groups, which are often associated with higher property values. It also lacks aromatic rings, which are often associated with negative property values. The presence of the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage, along with the piperidine ring, suggests a more complex structure, but without the specific functional groups that lead to higher property values.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative, similar to other aliphatic or cyclic structures with functional groups like amides or phosphorothioates.

Based on the analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around -0.6.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbon-carbon triple bond (C#C). It resembles some of the other polycyclic compounds in the examples, particularly those with multiple rings and oxygen-containing functional groups.

From the examples, we observe that polycyclic compounds with ketone groups (C=O) and hydroxyl groups (O) tend to have negative property values. For instance:
- CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C has a property value of -0.85122546.
- CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O has a property value of -0.71533904.

The presence of a carbon-carbon triple bond (C#C) is less common in the examples, but it is likely to contribute to a more negative property value due to increased molecular strain and potential instability.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is likely to be negative and similar to the values of other polycyclic compounds with similar functional groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately -0.75.

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings. The presence of methoxy groups (OC) and hydroxyl groups (O) suggests some degree of polarity, while the polycyclic nature and aromatic rings suggest a significant degree of hydrophobicity.

Comparing this structure to the examples provided, it seems to share some characteristics with complex polycyclic and aromatic structures, such as:

- Cc1c(C)c2c3ccccc3ccc2c4ccccc14, which has a property value of 2.46736791
- CC(C)C(Nc1ccc(cc1Cl)C(F)(F)F)C(=O)OC(C#N)c2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2, which has a property value of 11.87564927

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the property value is likely to be relatively high. However, it may not be as high as the most complex example provided (11.87564927) due to the absence of highly electronegative groups like trifluoromethyl or cyano groups.

Taking into account the structural complexity and the presence of both polar and non-polar regions, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 6.5.

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.7667288120545913
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to phenol derivatives and chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.

From the examples:
- Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (a nitrophenol) has a property value of -0.13638055.
- Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) has a property value of -0.84579.
- Clc1ccccc1I (iodobenzene) has a property value of 1.36248781.
- Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (dichlorobiphenyl) has a property value of -0.84051925.

Considering the structure of Oc1ccccc1Cl, it is a chlorinated phenol. The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) typically reduces the property value compared to halogenated benzenes without hydroxyl groups. The examples suggest that the presence of a hydroxyl group tends to lower the property value, while halogens can increase it, but the effect of the hydroxyl group is more dominant in reducing the value.

Given these considerations, the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is likely to be closer to the lower end of the range for chlorinated aromatics with hydroxyl groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl is approximately -0.13638055, similar to other phenol derivatives.

The molecule contains:
- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C), which is a linear and polarizable group.
- An ester linkage (OC(=O)), which is polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.
- An amide group (NC(=O)), which is also polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1), which is similar to some of the chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values, especially when multiple chlorines are present (e.g., Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of 2.3285167).
- Compounds with polar functional groups like esters and amides can have negative property values, but this is not always the case.

Considering the balance of these factors, the presence of polar groups, and the chlorinated aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be slightly positive, but not as high as those with multiple chlorines or highly polarizable groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around 0.5.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2) attached to the central carbon.
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have positive property values, especially when there are multiple chlorine atoms (e.g., ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl with a value of 8.39778055).
- Molecules with pyrimidine or similar heterocyclic structures tend to have slightly positive or neutral values (e.g., Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2 with a value of 0.36434031).
- The presence of a phenol group (OH attached to an aromatic ring) often results in negative or slightly negative values (e.g., Oc1ccc(O)cc1 with a value of -0.74251632).

Considering these observations, the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl has a combination of features that could lead to a slightly positive property value due to the presence of multiple aromatic rings and chlorine atoms, but the phenol group might slightly reduce this value.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.5.

- Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl with a property value of 3.31019311

Both of these examples are chlorinated hydrocarbons, and they have relatively high property values. Given that ClCCl is a smaller molecule than ClCCCl, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be somewhat lower than 2.85213235, but still positive due to the presence of chlorine atoms.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around 2.5.

SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.8479312404848627
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a methylphenol, specifically p-cresol, which is a phenol derivative with a methyl group attached to the benzene ring.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- Oc1cccc(O)c1 with a property value of -0.74251632
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O with a property value of -0.84793124

Both of these examples involve phenolic structures, with the first being a simple dihydroxybenzene and the second being a more substituted phenol. The presence of the hydroxyl group generally contributes to a negative property value, as seen in these examples.

Given that Cc1cccc(C)c1O is structurally similar to these examples, particularly to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, but with less steric hindrance due to the presence of only one methyl group, we can predict that the property value will also be negative and likely closer to the less substituted phenol example.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be approximately -0.74251632, similar to the simple phenol example.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.40848280427398204
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl, which is similar to the example Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 1.13913995. 

The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl has four chlorine atoms and two phenyl rings, similar to the example mentioned above. Given the structural similarity and the presence of multiple chlorine atoms, which tend to increase the property value, we can predict that the property value for this molecule will be close to that of the example with multiple chlorines.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is approximately 1.13913995.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.13638054916889394
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple hydrocarbon with a branched structure and a double bond.

From the examples, we can observe that simple hydrocarbons, especially those with branching or unsaturation (double bonds), tend to have property values around the range of -0.8 to 0.5. For instance:

- CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C has a property value of 0.54025145.
- CCCCCC has a property value of 0.54025145.
- CCCCCCCC has a property value of 0.54025145.
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 has a property value of -0.82157751.

Given that isoprene is a small, branched hydrocarbon with a double bond, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would be closer to the lower end of this range, similar to other small hydrocarbons with unsaturation.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be approximately -0.82157751.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 2.8521323543581727
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule ClCCl is dichloromethane, a simple chlorinated hydrocarbon.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values. For instance, ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of 4.60201998, and ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl) has a very high property value of 13.77311778. These examples suggest that the presence of chlorine atoms significantly influences the property value.

However, ClCCl is a much simpler molecule compared to the complex structures with multiple rings and functional groups. Therefore, its property value is expected to be lower than those of the more complex chlorinated compounds.

Considering the simplicity of ClCCl and the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around 1.0. This value reflects the influence of the chlorine atoms while accounting for the simplicity of the molecule.

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we have:

- Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which is 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, with a property value of 0.22680678.

Given that the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is identical to the example Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is 0.22680678.

True Property: 8.712707620032583
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known molecules.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as aromatic rings. The presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters, and phenols) suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and polar interactions, which could influence the property value.

From the examples, molecules with high complexity and multiple aromatic rings, such as c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5cccc6c(c1)c2c3c4c56, tend to have higher property values. Additionally, molecules with significant polar functional groups, like COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, also show high property values.

Considering these factors, the molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 is likely to have a relatively high property value due to its structural complexity and the presence of multiple polar functional groups.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value to be approximately 4.60201998, similar to other complex and highly functionalized molecules in the examples.

True Property: -0.8301424732019634
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A thioether group (CS-)
- A pyrazole ring (1,2,4-triazole-like structure)
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- An amine group (N)
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings and carbonyl groups, such as CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C, have a property value of -0.71533904.
- Molecules with similar functional groups and complexity, such as CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1, have a property value of -0.7589874.

Considering the structural similarities and the presence of both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, the predicted property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is likely to be in the same range as the examples with similar features.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is approximately -0.715.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6033356903449987
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ethyl benzoate, which is an ester formed from benzoic acid and ethanol. 

Looking at the examples, we have:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 with a property value of 4.72258829. This molecule is more complex due to the presence of additional functional groups like sulfonamide and a heterocyclic ring.
- CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O with a property value of 0.14823973. This molecule is a diketone with a phenyl group, similar to the ester linkage in ethyl benzoate.
- CCCCC(=O)OCC with a property value of -0.60333569. This is a simple ester with a longer alkyl chain.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is simpler than the first example and more similar to the second and third examples, which are simpler esters or ketones with phenyl groups. Given the structural similarity to CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, which has a property value of 0.14823973, and considering the ester linkage, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be close to this value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately 0.14823973.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 2.3744710106506948
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached, similar to the structure of Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which has a property value of -0.83738975. However, the aromatic structure in Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 might contribute to a different property value compared to a simple alkyl chain.

Another relevant example is CCCCCCCCO, which has a property value of 0.42165967. The presence of an oxygen atom in CCCCCCCCO might increase the property value compared to a bromine atom, which is more electronegative and might decrease the property value.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be slightly lower than that of CCCCCCCCO due to the presence of bromine instead of oxygen. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around 0.3.

Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: 0.4216596689279815
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for carbon monoxide (CO) based on the examples provided is challenging due to the lack of direct correlation or clear pattern between the molecular structure and the property values given. However, we can make an educated guess by considering the nature of CO as a small, simple diatomic molecule.

In the examples, small and relatively simple molecules like CCC (propane) and CCC(C)(C)CC (2,2-dimethylbutane) have property values around 0.5. Given that CO is even simpler and smaller, it might have a property value close to zero or slightly negative, as seen with other small molecules like NC(=O)N (urea) with a value of -0.79440023.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO could be around -0.5. However, this is a speculative estimate based on the limited information and examples provided.
