The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxo group and a nitrogen atom. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings and heteroatoms.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with aromatic rings and heteroatoms, such as nitrogen and oxygen, tend to have negative property values. For instance:
- c1cncnc1 has a property value of -0.86976056.
- Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C has a property value of 0.15596325, but this includes additional alkyl groups which may influence the value.
- CNc1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.61394386.

Given the structure of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, which is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic ring, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value, similar to other aromatic heterocycles with electronegative atoms.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.5133685983205183
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an isopropyl group (CC(C)). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have relatively high property values, such as 2.91994533. This suggests that the presence of a nitro group contributes significantly to the property value.

Given this information and the structural similarity to the example with a nitro group, I would predict that the property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is likely to be positive and relatively high. However, without exact calculations or more specific examples, a precise prediction is challenging.

Based on the trend observed, I would estimate the property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O to be approximately 2.5.

1. The presence of a pyrrole ring with carbonyl groups suggests some degree of electron-withdrawing character, which can influence the property value.
2. The bromine atom is a halogen, similar to chlorine, which is present in several examples with varying property values.
3. The examples with pyrrole or similar heterocyclic structures, such as OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O (0.70540198) and CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NCC)n1 (0.79936063), have positive property values.
4. The presence of alkyl groups (CCC(C)) can contribute to a more neutral or slightly positive property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a positive property value, but not as high as those with more complex aromatic systems or additional electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on the analysis and comparison with similar structures, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O would be around 0.5.

The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the new molecule.

Considering the structural similarity and the fact that the additional alkyl chain might not significantly alter the property value drastically, we can predict that the property value for the new molecule will be close to that of the similar example.

Therefore, the predicted property value for O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is approximately 2.1465028.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is an acetanilide derivative with a nitro group attached to the aromatic ring.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with nitro groups attached to aromatic rings tend to have negative property values. For instance, O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.5133686, and COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.01515195. The presence of the acetamide group (CC(=O)N-) in the molecule might influence the property value slightly, but it is likely to remain in the negative range due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O would be around -0.5, similar to other nitroaromatic compounds in the examples. Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately:

- An ester linkage (OCC).
- A thioether linkage (SC).
- A chloro-substituted aromatic ring.
- A heterocyclic structure with a lactam (n1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12).

- Molecules with ester linkages (e.g., CCC(=O)OC) tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with chloro-substituted aromatic rings (e.g., Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl) tend to have a property value of 0.0.
- Molecules with heterocyclic structures and additional functional groups (e.g., COc2ncc1nccnc1n2) can have positive property values.

Considering these observations, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the complex heterocyclic structure with a chloro-substituted aromatic ring suggests a potential for a positive property value. However, the ester and thioether linkages might contribute to a more negative or neutral value.

Balancing these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be slightly positive, but not as high as the more complex heterocyclic examples with multiple functional groups.

Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

Looking at the examples, molecules with sulfonamide groups, such as Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, have relatively high property values. However, the presence of additional functional groups like nitro groups in the examples tends to increase the property value significantly.

Considering the balance of these features, the predicted property value for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is likely to be moderately high, but not as high as those with additional electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 3.0.

From the examples, molecules with nitro groups attached to aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, such as Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (0.85853387) and Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O (3.40548024). The presence of the trifluoromethyl group might further increase the property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O is likely to be positive and could be in the range of 1 to 3. A reasonable estimate would be around 2.5.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the examples provided. For instance, the molecule c1ccccc1O (phenol) has a property value of -0.82375223. The presence of a methyl group (CH3) in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 might slightly alter this value, but based on the examples, the presence of alkyl groups like methyl often does not significantly change the property value from that of the parent aromatic compound.

Therefore, considering the similarity to phenol and the influence of the methyl group, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is likely to be close to that of phenol. Thus, the predicted property value is approximately:

The key difference in the target molecule is the presence of a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) on the aromatic ring instead of halogens. However, the overall structure and functional groups are quite similar to the examples with the phosphorothioate group and aromatic substitutions.

Given this structural similarity, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 will be close to -0.86767025. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

-0.86767025

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, especially those that are aromatic and heavily chlorinated, tend to have a property value of 0.0. For instance, the molecules "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" and "ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl" both have a property value of 0.0.

The molecule "Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl" is also a heavily chlorinated aromatic compound. Based on the pattern observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that this molecule will also have a property value of 0.0.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.5133685983205183
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a nitroalkane, specifically a nitropropane. 

From the examples, we can observe that simple alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons tend to have a property value of 0.0. However, the presence of functional groups such as nitro groups (N(=O)=O) can significantly alter the property value. For instance, molecules with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, have higher property values, indicating a strong influence of the nitro group.

Given that CCCN(=O)=O is a relatively simple molecule with a single nitro group, we can expect its property value to be influenced by the presence of the nitro group, but not as high as more complex nitroaromatic compounds. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 0.8, similar to other molecules with nitro groups but less complex structures.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O is approximately 0.8.

- The presence of a single halogen substituent on a benzene ring tends to result in a property value of 0.0.

Given that Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar in structure to these examples, with a single fluorine and bromine substituent on a benzene ring, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for this molecule will also be 0.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with simple aliphatic structures and no significant functional groups, such as CBr, CCCCBr, and CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, tend to have a property value of 0.0.
2. Molecules with alcohol groups, such as CCC(C)(C)O and CCCCCCCCC(C)O, have negative property values around -0.82375223.
3. More complex structures with additional functional groups or aromatic rings tend to have varying property values, often negative unless they contain specific functional groups that increase the property value.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It is similar in complexity to the examples with negative property values due to the presence of the alcohol group. Given the pattern observed, it is reasonable to predict that this molecule will have a negative property value similar to other alcohol-containing compounds.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is approximately -0.82375223.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC) and a cyclic amide (lactam) structure similar to a benzamide. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 0.22758752. The main difference is the presence of a sulfur atom in the example, which is replaced by a nitrogen atom in the molecule in question.

Given the structural similarity, particularly the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the cyclic amide, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O will be close to that of the similar example. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 0.22758752.

To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzodiazepine-like structure, featuring a carbonyl group attached to a nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring, with an additional phenyl group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule CN2C(=C(O)c1ccccc1S2(=O)=O)C(=O)Nc3ccccn3, which has a property value of 5.88864291. However, the example molecule is more complex and contains additional functional groups that likely contribute to its higher property value.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is simpler and lacks the additional sulfonyl and other functional groups present in the example. Therefore, its property value is expected to be lower than 5.88864291.

Considering the examples and the structural features of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around -0.7 to -0.8, similar to other aromatic and heterocyclic compounds with carbonyl groups.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is approximately -0.75.

- A thioester linkage (SC(CCl))
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl)
- A cyclic imide structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with complex structures and multiple functional groups, such as phosphorothioates or cyclic imides, tend to have non-zero property values.
- The presence of aromatic rings and halogens (like Cl) can influence the property value, but the effect is not straightforward.

Given the complexity of the molecule and the presence of multiple functional groups, it is likely that the property value is non-zero. Comparing with similar complex structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.7. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is approximately 0.7.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A tertiary amide group (CN(C)C(=O)N).
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)).
- A heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen (n2nc(oc2=O)).
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C).

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have higher property values, often positive.
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens (Cl, Br) often have property values around 0.0.
- Molecules with amide groups can have negative property values, but this depends on the rest of the structure.

The given molecule has a complex structure with a combination of these features. The presence of the chlorinated aromatic ring and the heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen suggests a potential for a property value that is not strongly positive or negative. The tert-butyl group adds steric bulk, which might influence the property value slightly.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be slightly negative, but not as low as those with multiple nitro groups or highly polar functional groups.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C could be around -0.5.

- Molecules with bromobenzene, such as Oc1ccc(Br)cc1, have a property value of -0.82375223.

Considering these observations, the presence of both an acetamide group and a bromobenzene moiety suggests that the property value might be influenced by both features. The examples with similar structures tend to have property values around -0.82375223.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately -0.82375223.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some patterns:
- Molecules with benzene rings and simple substituents, such as COc1ccccc1 (anisole), have negative property values.
- Molecules with more complex or multiple functional groups, especially those with nitro groups, tend to have higher positive property values.

Benzaldehyde has a single aldehyde group attached to a benzene ring, which is a relatively simple structure compared to those with multiple functional groups or nitro groups.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of nitrogen atoms in aromatic systems, such as in heterocycles or as substituents, often results in negative property values.
- The molecule N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which is similar in structure but with a different nitrogen linkage, has a property value of -0.8669604.

Given these observations, the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is expected to have a similar negative property value due to its structural similarity to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, with the main difference being the type of nitrogen linkage.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be approximately -0.8669604, similar to the structurally related example.

In the examples, similar cyclic structures with amide groups, such as O=C1N(COC(=O)CC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (2.20095526) and O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC (2.1465028), have property values around 2.0.

Considering the structural similarity and the presence of amide groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 would be around 2.0. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

The molecule in question, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is a symmetrical molecule with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure. 

In the examples, symmetrical molecules with halogen atoms, such as Clc1ccccc1Cl and Ic1ccccc1, have a property value of 0.0. This suggests that the presence of halogens in a symmetrical aromatic system tends to result in a property value of 0.0. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is 0.0.

Iteration: 52
SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is an alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically a diethylbenzene.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- Cc1ccccc1N, which is an alkyl-substituted benzene with an amine group, has a property value of -0.87000208.
- CCCc1ccccn1, which is an alkyl-substituted pyridine, has a property value of -0.64388874.
- CCCCCCCc1ccccc1, which is a long-chain alkyl-substituted benzene, has a property value of 0.0.

The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is similar to CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 in that it is an alkyl-substituted benzene, but with shorter alkyl chains. The property value for CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 is 0.0, which suggests that the presence of a long alkyl chain on a benzene ring tends to neutralize the property value.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 has shorter alkyl chains than CCCCCCCc1ccccc1, it is reasonable to predict that its property value might be slightly negative, as shorter alkyl chains might not neutralize the property value as effectively as longer chains.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is slightly negative, around -0.5. However, without more specific data on similar structures, this is an estimation based on the trends observed in the examples.

True Property: 3.6403673003122425
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is a para-substituted aniline with a sulfonamide group. In the examples, we have a similar structure: Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of 1.44069928. The key difference between these two molecules is the substituent on the benzene ring: a nitro group (N(=O)=O) in the example and a sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) in the target molecule.

Both nitro and sulfonamide groups are electron-withdrawing, but the nitro group is generally more strongly electron-withdrawing than the sulfonamide group. This difference in electron-withdrawing strength can affect the property value, likely making the sulfonamide-substituted compound less polar or less reactive compared to the nitro-substituted compound.

Given this analysis, the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is likely to be slightly lower than that of the nitro-substituted example. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be around 1.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the structures in the examples, particularly those with multiple aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups.

From the examples, molecules with multiple aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups, such as Oc1cccc(O)c1 (-0.6178778) and Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 (1.18915264), have property values that are either slightly negative or positive, depending on the specific arrangement and type of functional groups.

Given the structure of the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, which includes multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone, it is likely to have a property value that is slightly positive due to the presence of these electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, which can influence the overall electronic properties of the molecule.

Therefore, based on the patterns observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 1.0.

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 0.19513079734371577
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)O), an amide group (NC(C)=O), and a thiol group (SC). In the examples, molecules with similar functional groups, such as phosphorothioates and amides, tend to have negative property values. For instance, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of -0.86767025, and CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of -0.8602385.

Considering the presence of these functional groups and their influence on the property values in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC will also be negative and likely in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is approximately -0.85.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the examples provided and look for patterns or similarities. The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is a simple alkene with two chlorine atoms attached to the double-bonded carbon atoms. 

From the examples, we can observe that simple hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons often have a property value of 0.0. For instance, molecules like Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl and CCC(C)C1(CC=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O have a property value of 0.0. 

Given that Cl\C=C/Cl is a relatively simple molecule with two chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be 0.0, following the pattern observed in similar simple halogenated hydrocarbons.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl is 0.0.

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 4.506996105198819
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A benzene ring (c1ccccc1) attached to an amide group (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23), which is similar to the structure in O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 with a property value of -0.59344456.
- An ester linkage (COC(=O)) similar to the structure in CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC with a property value of 0.0.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (cc(Cl)ccc) similar to the structure in Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl with a property value of 0.0.
- A polyol moiety (OCC(O)CO) similar to the structure in OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO with a property value of 10.50188668.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property value, the presence of the polyol moiety suggests a significant positive contribution, while the aromatic and amide groups may contribute negatively or neutrally. Balancing these influences, the predicted property value is likely to be positive but not as high as the polyol alone.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 is approximately 2.5.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.8237522337520979
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some aspect of the molecule's electronic or steric properties. The examples with simple hydrocarbon chains or small, non-polar molecules tend to have property values around 0.0. 

The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol (1-hexanol), which is a simple, non-aromatic compound with a polar hydroxyl group. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons like CCCCCC (hexane) and other small, non-polar molecules have property values of 0.0. However, the presence of the hydroxyl group in CCCCCO introduces some polarity, which might slightly alter the property value compared to a purely hydrocarbon chain.

Given this reasoning, the property value for CCCCCO is likely to be close to 0.0, but slightly negative due to the presence of the polar hydroxyl group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be around -0.1.

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 1.811399116265646
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is often associated with polar and electron-withdrawing characteristics.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is also polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which is common in many of the examples with varying property values.
- An ether linkage (CCO1), which can also contribute to polarity.

From the examples, molecules with polar functional groups like sulfonyl and amide tend to have positive property values, especially when combined with aromatic rings. For instance, the molecule CNC(=O)ON=C(SC)C(=O)N(C)C has a property value of 1.64336561, and it contains both amide and sulfonyl-like groups.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the predicted property value for CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is likely to be positive and in a similar range to those with similar functional groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately 1.5.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several functional groups and structural features that can influence its property value:

1. **Ester Groups (COC(=O))**: Esters are present in the molecule, which can contribute to a negative property value, as seen in some examples.

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The presence of a nitro group is significant. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative property values, such as -0.5133686 for Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O.

3. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: The presence of an aromatic ring is common in many examples, often associated with a property value of 0.0, but the influence of other groups can alter this.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring (C1=C(C)NC)**: The heterocyclic ring with nitrogen can also influence the property value, potentially contributing to a negative value.

5. **Overall Structure**: The combination of these groups, especially the nitro group and ester functionalities, suggests a tendency towards a negative property value.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be negative. Based on the influence of the nitro group and ester functionalities, a reasonable prediction would be around -0.6 to -0.8.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C is approximately:

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a relatively small and compact structure with two amide groups and a cycloalkane ring. In the examples, molecules with similar features, such as amide groups and cyclic structures, tend to have property values around the range of -0.5 to 0.5, depending on additional functional groups and overall molecular complexity.

Considering the examples:
- Molecules with amide groups and aromatic rings, like OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O, have a property value of 0.70540198.
- Molecules with simpler structures and fewer aromatic or complex functional groups, like CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1, have a property value of -0.82420924.

The given molecule lacks aromatic rings and has a relatively simple structure compared to the more complex examples with higher property values. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict a property value closer to the lower end of the range.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1

This molecule contains an aromatic ring with a phosphoric acid ester group (OP(=O)(O-)O-) attached to it. The presence of aromatic rings and the phosphoric acid ester group suggests that the molecule might have a property value similar to those with similar functional groups in the examples.

From the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and additional functional groups like phosphoric acid esters or similar groups tend to have property values that are not extreme (neither very high nor very low). For instance, the molecule:

- Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1 has a property value of -0.82420924.

Given the structure of the molecule and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around -0.8. Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1 is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is often associated with increased lipophilicity and electron-withdrawing effects.
- An aromatic ring, which is common in many of the examples with varying property values.
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle, specifically a piperidine-like structure, which can influence the electronic properties and steric effects.
- Chlorine atoms, which are present in several examples with property values around 0.0.

Looking at the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents, particularly chlorine, often have property values around 0.0. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group might slightly alter this, but not drastically, as seen in the examples.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O is likely to be close to 0.0. However, given the electron-withdrawing nature of the CF3 group, it might slightly deviate from 0.0, but not significantly.

True Property: -0.015151946667643206
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (CO) attached to a benzene ring, with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) also attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings and nitro groups tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of 3.6554449, which is relatively high due to the presence of two nitro groups on the benzene ring.

Given that COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has one nitro group and a methoxy group, we can expect its property value to be positive, but likely lower than the example with two nitro groups. The methoxy group is less electron-withdrawing than a nitro group, which might slightly reduce the overall property value compared to a dinitro compound.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around 1.5.

To predict the property of the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 0.0. Both molecules are heavily chlorinated and lack functional groups that typically contribute to significant deviations from a neutral property value, such as nitro groups or carbonyls.

Given the structural similarity and the lack of polar or reactive functional groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl will also be 0.0.

The molecule CCCOC=O is relatively simple and does not have any strongly electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups that would significantly alter its property value compared to simple hydrocarbons. Based on the examples, particularly the simple esters and similar compounds, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CCCOC=O would be close to 0.0, but slightly negative due to the presence of the ester group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O is approximately -0.82375223, similar to other simple esters and alcohols in the examples.

- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, have a property value of -0.51548382.

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro and chloro groups generally leads to more negative property values. The combination of these groups in the molecule suggests a property value that is likely more negative than those of simpler structures with similar groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be around -0.6 to -0.7. Given the examples, a specific prediction could be:

In the examples, molecules with similar functional groups and aromatic systems, such as COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, have a property value of -0.67449076. However, the presence of additional aromatic systems and the symmetry in the molecule could influence the property value.

Considering the examples and the structural complexity of the molecule, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be in a similar range to other molecules with phosphorothioate groups and aromatic systems. Therefore, a predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 could be approximately -0.67449076.

- CNc1ccccc1, an aniline derivative, with a property value of -0.61394386.

The presence of the nitro group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, generally contributes to a negative property value. The phenol group also tends to have a negative influence due to its acidic nature.

Considering these factors and the examples, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is likely to be around -0.5. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the specific property value is:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne with a terminal triple bond, also known as 1-butyne.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with simple alkane or alkene structures, such as CCCCCCCCCC=C, have a property value of 0.0.
- Molecules with carbonyl groups (C=O) or other polar functional groups tend to have negative property values, such as CCC(=O)C (-0.76293362) and CC(C)OC=O (-0.8701007).
- Molecules with aromatic rings and additional functional groups can have a wide range of property values, often negative or zero.

Given that CCC#C is a small, non-aromatic hydrocarbon with a triple bond, it is likely to have a property value close to those of simple hydrocarbons. However, the presence of the triple bond might slightly influence the property value compared to alkanes or alkenes.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be close to 0.0, but slightly negative due to the presence of the triple bond. Therefore, a predicted property value for CCC#C could be approximately:

- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl, both of which have a property value of 0.0.

Considering these structural similarities, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the chlorinated aromatic ring suggests that the property value might be influenced by both components. The phosphorothioate group tends to have a negative contribution, while the chlorinated aromatic ring tends to have a neutral or slightly negative contribution.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl would be slightly negative, similar to the example with the phosphorothioate group.

However, the example molecule has an additional nitrogen in the ring and a different arrangement of functional groups, which likely contributes to its high property value.

The presence of the carbonyl and hydrazine groups in c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 suggests it might have a moderately high property value, but not as high as the example with the additional nitrogen in the ring. Considering the examples and the structural features, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be around 1.5.

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, have a positive property value (1.62428388).
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, tend to have negative property values (-0.86058757).
- Molecules with piperidine rings, such as Cn2c(=O)n(C)c1ncn(CC(O)CO)c1c2=O, have a high positive property value (6.39190526).

Considering these observations, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the piperidine ring suggests a positive contribution to the property value. However, the amide linkage might contribute negatively. Balancing these factors, the predicted property value is likely to be positive but not as high as the example with the piperidine ring alone.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is approximately 1.5.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property value is related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups or structural features. For simple alkanes, such as linear or branched hydrocarbons without additional functional groups, the property value appears to be 0.0. 

The molecule CCCCCCCC is a linear alkane (octane), similar to other simple hydrocarbons like C/C1CCCCC1\C and CCCCCCCO, which have property values of 0.0. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCC is 0.0.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 0.35677902670150197
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbon-carbon triple bond (C#C). The presence of multiple rings and a hydroxyl group suggests some similarity to the examples with polycyclic structures and oxygen-containing functional groups.

From the examples, we observe that polycyclic compounds with oxygen functionalities, such as CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCC3CCC2C3 (2.1465028) and CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O (-0.71789063), have varying property values depending on the specific functional groups and overall structure.

The presence of a hydroxyl group and a carbon-carbon triple bond in the molecule could influence the property value. The hydroxyl group might increase the property value due to its polar nature, while the triple bond could have a different effect.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C would be around -0.7 to 0.2. Given the structural complexity and the presence of the hydroxyl group, a value closer to the lower end of this range might be more appropriate.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule is approximately:

-0.5

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups. The presence of methoxy (OC) and hydroxyl (O) groups suggests some degree of polarity, which could influence the property value.

From the examples provided, we observe that molecules with significant aromatic character and multiple oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have property values that are not zero, often positive, especially if they contain nitro groups or other electron-withdrawing groups. However, the molecule in question does not contain nitro groups, but it does have a complex structure with multiple oxygen atoms, which could contribute to a non-zero property value.

Considering the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen atoms, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be a positive value, but not as high as those with nitro groups. Based on the examples, a value around 1.5 to 2.5 seems plausible.

Therefore, a predicted property value for the given molecule could be approximately:

2.0

True Property: -0.8237522337520979
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the presence of certain functional groups and structural features influence the property value.

- The molecule Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.85853387, indicating that the presence of a nitro group on a phenol significantly increases the property value.
- The molecule Oc1ccccc1I has a property value of 0.0, suggesting that the presence of an iodine atom on a phenol does not increase the property value.
- The molecule Clc1ccccc1I also has a property value of 0.0, indicating that the presence of halogens on a benzene ring does not increase the property value.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol. Based on the examples, the presence of a chlorine atom on a phenol does not seem to significantly increase the property value, similar to the iodine example. Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is likely to be close to 0.0.

Predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl: 0.0

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -0.6880512932270161
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C), which is a linear and polarizable group.
- An ester linkage (OC(=O)), which is polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
- An amide group (NC(=O)), which is also polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1), which is similar to some of the chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with polar functional groups like amides and esters tend to have negative property values, especially when combined with aromatic rings.
- Chlorinated aromatic compounds often have property values around zero, but the presence of additional polar groups can shift the value.

Considering these factors, the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative due to the presence of the polar amide and ester groups, along with the chlorinated aromatic ring.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.5.

True Property: -0.38141315772510936
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2) attached to the central carbon.
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents often have a property value of 0.0, especially when they are symmetrical or lack significant polar functional groups.
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings and additional functional groups like carbonyls or amines tend to have non-zero property values, often positive if they have electron-withdrawing groups or are part of a larger conjugated system.

The molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl has a combination of aromatic and heterocyclic rings, with chlorine substituents that can influence the electronic distribution. However, it lacks strong electron-withdrawing groups like nitro or sulfonyl groups that are present in examples with high positive property values.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a property value close to zero, similar to other aromatic compounds with halogen substituents and no strong electron-withdrawing groups. Therefore, the predicted property value for this molecule is:

0.0

Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a calculated property such as a partition coefficient or solubility parameter. The examples show that molecules with similar functional groups and structural features tend to have similar property values.

The molecule CCCCCOC=O (pentyl acetate) is an ester, similar to the example molecule CCCCCCC=O (heptanal) which has a property value of -0.76293362. Esters and aldehydes can have similar properties due to their polar carbonyl groups, although esters might be slightly more polar due to the additional oxygen atom.

Given this, I would predict that the property value for CCCCCOC=O would be close to that of CCCCCCC=O. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCOC=O is approximately -0.76293362.

From the examples, we can observe that phenol derivatives, such as Oc1cccc(O)c1 and c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC, have property values of -0.6178778. Additionally, other similar structures with phenolic groups tend to have property values in the same range.

Given this pattern, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O will be similar to those of other phenol derivatives. Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is approximately -0.6178778.

The molecule "Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl" is similar in structure, containing multiple chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for this molecule is also 0.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple hydrocarbon with a double bond and a branched structure.

From the examples, we notice that simple hydrocarbons, especially those with no polar functional groups or aromatic rings, tend to have property values around 0.0. For instance, molecules like CCCCCC (hexane) and CCCCCCCC (octane) have property values of 0.0. Additionally, molecules with similar structures, such as CCCCCC=C (1-octene), also have a property value of 0.0.

Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples. The examples provided show a range of property values, with some correlation to the complexity and functional groups present in the molecules.

The molecule in question appears to be quite complex, with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and hydroxyl groups.

True Property: 1.9681139781593882
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of the thiosemicarbazide moiety suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and polar interactions, which could influence the property value. The tert-butyl group is a bulky, non-polar group that might reduce the overall polarity of the molecule.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar functional groups and structural features, such as CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C, have a property value of 1.48403261. This example has a similar heterocyclic structure and a tert-butyl group, which suggests that the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C might be in a similar range.

Looking at the examples, esters and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, which contains a diketone and an aromatic ring, has a property value of -0.79278101. Similarly, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2, which is a more complex molecule with an ester and aromatic rings, has a positive value due to additional functional groups.

Given that CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is a simpler ester with an aromatic ring, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value, similar to other simple esters and aromatic compounds in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around -0.8.
