True Property: -0.6946168604761496
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a linear ester with a long alkyl chain, similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's consider the examples with similar structures:
- CCCCCCCC(C)O has a property value of -0.76102797.
- CCCCCCC(C)O has a property value of -0.62069272.
- CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of -0.1735737.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is an ester with a 10-carbon alkyl chain. The closest example is CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which is a 12-carbon ester and has a property value of -0.1735737. Given that the molecule in question has a slightly shorter chain, we can expect a similar but slightly more negative property value due to the trend observed in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is approximately -0.2.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.6752716530348674
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxygen and a nitrogen atom in a five-membered ring. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings and heteroatoms.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with chlorine substituents tend to have negative property values, such as Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (-0.73613318) and Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 (-0.50820276).
- Compounds with heteroatoms like nitrogen and oxygen in a ring structure also tend to have negative property values, such as O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1 (1.10348579) and O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC=C (0.5331104).

Considering these observations, the presence of both chlorine and a heterocyclic structure with oxygen and nitrogen suggests a negative property value. However, the specific arrangement and the presence of the carbonyl group might slightly influence the value.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around -0.5.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.0405800241789707
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O). The presence of the nitro group is significant because it is an electron-withdrawing group, which often contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in some of the examples with nitro groups.

Looking at the examples:
- Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO has a property value of -0.63175801.
- Other molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like Cl or Br also tend to have negative property values.

Given the presence of the nitro group and the relatively simple structure of isopropyl nitrite, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is negative and similar to other small molecules with electron-withdrawing groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.63.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic compound with multiple rings and carbonyl groups, similar to some of the examples provided. Notably, it resembles the structure of steroids, which are often complex polycyclic compounds. The example CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C, which is a steroid-like structure, has a property value of 3.92937508. 

Given the structural complexity and the presence of multiple rings and carbonyl groups, the property value for the given molecule is likely to be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO would be approximately 3.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

This molecule contains:
- A difluorobenzene moiety (Fc1cccc(F)c1), which is similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 with a property value of -0.02497579.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N), which is a common feature in several molecules but not directly comparable to any specific example.
- A chlorobenzene moiety (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), which is similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of -0.40980871.

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like fluorine and chlorine generally leads to a more negative property value, as seen in the examples. The amide linkage might not significantly alter this trend.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, the predicted property value for Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 is likely to be slightly negative, similar to the examples with halogenated aromatic rings.

A reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately -0.5.

True Property: -0.01912137115730634
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with an alkyl chain. It is similar in structure to other small aliphatic ethers and alcohols in the examples, such as CCOC(=O)CC (0.43512734) and CCCCCO (0.47099276). These molecules have positive property values, likely due to the presence of the ether or ester functional group, which can contribute to a positive property value in this context.

Given the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C would be slightly positive, similar to the other small ethers and alcohols.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is approximately 0.45.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Alkyl Chain (CCC(C)-)**: The presence of an alkyl chain generally contributes to a slightly positive or neutral property value, as seen in examples like CCC(C)CC (0.13525726) and CC(C)CCO (0.47907925).

2. **Pyrrole Ring (n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O)**: Pyrrole rings can have varying effects depending on substitution. The presence of carbonyl groups and a bromine atom can influence the property value. In the examples, halogenated aromatic compounds like Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (-0.40980871) and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl (-0.6618051) tend to have negative property values.

3. **Carbonyl Groups (c(=O) and c1=O)**: Carbonyl groups often contribute to a more negative property value due to their electron-withdrawing nature, as seen in examples like CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.79263049).

4. **Bromine Substitution (c(Br)c)**: The presence of bromine, a heavy halogen, can also contribute to a more negative property value, as seen in examples like CCCCCCCBr (-0.69884914).

Considering these factors, the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative, influenced by the electron-withdrawing effects of the carbonyl groups and the bromine atom, despite the presence of the alkyl chain.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.6.

True Property: -0.7630206585765118
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some aspect of molecular stability, reactivity, or electronic properties.

Biphenyl is an aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of two connected phenyl rings. In the examples, aromatic compounds with multiple rings, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34 has a property value of 2.40365797, and it consists of three fused benzene rings.

Given that biphenyl is a simpler structure with only two benzene rings, we can expect its property value to be lower than that of more complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but higher than that of single-ring aromatic compounds like benzene derivatives.

Based on this reasoning and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around 0.5. This value reflects its intermediate complexity and aromatic nature compared to the examples given.

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.23516276145470244
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCCCCS is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a sulfur atom at the end. This structure is similar to linear alkanes, which generally have negative property values in the examples provided.

For instance, the molecule CCCCCCC=C (a linear alkene) has a property value of -0.72816279, and CCCCCCC(C)O (a linear alcohol) has a property value of -0.76102797. Both of these molecules have similar linear structures with additional functional groups, which tend to slightly increase the property value compared to a simple alkane.

Given that CCCCCS is a linear alkane with a sulfur atom, we can expect its property value to be in the negative range, similar to other linear alkanes and simple derivatives. Considering the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be around -0.75.

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.3649396087193908
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with a tertiary carbon attached to an alcohol group. This structure is similar to the example CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O, which has a property value of -0.78902437. Both molecules have a tertiary alcohol group, but CCCC(C)(C)CO is less complex and has fewer rings and substituents.

Another similar example is CCC(C)(C)C, which has a property value of 0.13525726. This molecule is a branched alkane without an alcohol group, and its property value is slightly positive.

Considering the presence of the alcohol group in CCCC(C)(C)CO, which tends to lower the property value due to increased polarity and potential hydrogen bonding, the property value is likely to be negative but not as low as the more complex alcohol example.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO would be around -0.3.

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.7925770206314836
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is a naphthalene derivative, which is similar to the example Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 with a property value of -0.72947956. 

The structure of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is a naphthalene ring system, which is an aromatic hydrocarbon. Aromatic hydrocarbons in the examples tend to have negative property values, especially when they are simple aromatic systems without additional functional groups that might significantly alter the property.

Given the similarity to the example Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, and considering the lack of additional substituents that might significantly change the property, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 would be close to that of the similar naphthalene derivative.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately -0.72947956.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic urea, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -0.75219437. The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the new molecule.

The addition of an alkyl chain generally increases hydrophobicity, which might slightly increase the property value compared to the original cyclic urea example. However, the overall structure and functional groups remain similar, suggesting that the property value will not deviate significantly from the example.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be slightly higher than -0.75219437, but still negative due to the presence of the polar urea groups.

A predicted property value could be around -0.7.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.02497579135873726
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group is known to be electron-withdrawing due to the high electronegativity of fluorine atoms. This can affect the overall electronic properties of the molecule.

Looking at the examples, we can see that molecules with halogen substituents on aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1 (-0.74275636) and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (2.14595417), have varying property values depending on the number and type of halogens and their positions.

Given that trifluoromethylbenzene has a single trifluoromethyl group, it is likely to have a property value that reflects the electron-withdrawing nature of the group, but not as extreme as molecules with multiple halogens or more complex structures.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around 0.5. This value reflects the influence of the trifluoromethyl group while considering the aromatic nature of the benzene ring.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a sugar alcohol, specifically a form of glucose, which is a polyol. It contains multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups, similar to the example OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, which has a property value of -0.51212904. Both molecules are polyols with similar structures, having multiple hydroxyl groups that contribute to their hydrophilic nature.

Given the structural similarity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O will be close to that of the similar polyol example. Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately -0.512.

This molecule is a complex structure with multiple rings and functional groups. It contains ester groups (CC(=O)O), ketone groups (C=O), and multiple cyclohexane rings, which are similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's compare it with the example:

CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of 5.36186342.

Both molecules have a similar core structure with multiple cyclohexane rings and ketone groups. The main difference is the presence of an additional ester group and hydroxyl groups in the molecule we are predicting.

Considering the structural similarities and the presence of additional polar groups, which might slightly increase the property value, we can predict that the property value for the given molecule will be slightly higher than 5.36186342.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately:

Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as functional groups, molecular size, and overall molecular geometry. The molecule in question, CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O, appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with a ketone group and a hydroxyl group.

From the examples provided, it seems that larger, more complex polycyclic structures with functional groups like ketones and alcohols tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O has a property value of 1.60889653, which is relatively high compared to simpler structures.

Given the complexity and the presence of functional groups in the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O, I would predict a property value that is moderately high, similar to other complex polycyclic structures with functional groups.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O is approximately 1.5.

This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with nitro groups and aromatic rings, such as O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (-0.16633552) and COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (-0.58537315).

The presence of the nitro group generally contributes to a negative property value, as seen in the examples. The acetamide group (CC(=O)N) is also present in some examples, such as CNC(=O)C=C(C)OP(=O)(OC)OC (-0.78201021), which also has a negative value.

Considering these structural similarities and the trends observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O will be negative and likely in the range of the examples with nitro groups and aromatic rings.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O would be approximately -0.6.

True Property: 3.869590037524545
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is not directly represented in the examples, but similar to some sulfur-containing compounds.
- An aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent, similar to some of the chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.

- Chlorinated aromatic compounds, such as Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl, have a property value of -0.3218325.
- Esters, such as CCC(=O)OC, have a property value of 0.43512734.

Considering these features, the molecule is likely to have a property value influenced by the presence of sulfur, chlorine, and ester groups. The presence of the phosphorothioate group might increase the property value compared to simple esters or chlorinated aromatics.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be around 0.5.

True Property: 0.47907924757406584
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)(C)CO is tert-butanol, which is a tertiary alcohol. In the examples, we have several alcohols and hydrocarbons with varying chain lengths and branching:

1. CCC (propane) has a property value of 1.99711975.
2. CC(C)CO (isobutanol) has a property value of 1.06939328.
3. CCCCCCC(C)O (a longer chain alcohol) has a property value of -0.76102797.
4. CCCCC(CC)CO (another longer chain alcohol) has a property value of -0.61864443.

Tert-butanol (CC(C)(C)CO) is similar to isobutanol (CC(C)CO) but with an additional methyl group, making it more branched. The presence of the alcohol group generally decreases the property value compared to hydrocarbons, but branching can increase it.

Given that isobutanol has a property value of 1.06939328, and considering the additional branching in tert-butanol, we can expect the property value to be slightly higher than that of isobutanol.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO (tert-butanol) would be approximately 1.1.

The molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is a bicyclic compound with two nitrogen-containing heterocycles, specifically a purine-like structure. This structure is similar to nucleobases, which are generally polar and can participate in hydrogen bonding due to the presence of nitrogen atoms and carbonyl groups.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitrogen heterocycles and carbonyl groups, such as Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F (0.18714959) and Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1 (0.18288869), have positive property values. These examples suggest that the presence of nitrogen heterocycles and carbonyl groups tends to result in a positive property value.

Based on this analysis, the predicted property value for the molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is likely to be positive and similar to the values of the examples with similar structural features. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 0.18.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl acetate, an ester.

From the examples, we can observe that esters generally have negative property values. For instance, CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC has a property value of -0.69668429, and CCC(C)C(=O)C has a property value of 0.09711207. The presence of the ester functional group (OC=O) tends to contribute to a negative property value, but the overall structure and substituents can influence the final value.

Considering the examples and the structure of isopropyl acetate, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be slightly negative, reflecting the ester group influence. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a urea derivative with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. 

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings, such as phenyl groups, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule NC(=O)c1cccnc1 has a property value of -0.13829902, and it contains an amide group attached to a pyridine ring. Similarly, the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.29422192, and it contains a nitro group attached to a phenol ring.

Given that O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 is structurally similar to these examples, with two phenyl groups and a central urea linkage, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Considering the examples and the structural features, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.3.

True Property: -0.6927447899205811
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The given molecule is triphenylene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a planar structure composed of four fused benzene rings.

From the examples, we can observe that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 (a larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon), have a property value of 1.64551009. The structure of triphenylene is somewhat similar but smaller in size compared to the larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon example.

Considering the trend that larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons tend to have higher property values, and given that triphenylene is smaller, we can predict that its property value will be somewhat lower than 1.64551009. However, it is still likely to be positive due to the aromatic nature and the stability of the structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of triphenylene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13) would be around 1.2.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with sulfonamide groups, such as O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O, have negative property values.
- Aromatic amines, like NNc1ccccc1, also tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of multiple polar groups and the overall structure suggest a tendency towards a negative property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is likely to be negative, similar to other polar and aromatic compounds in the examples. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around -0.5, given the influence of the sulfonamide and guanidine groups.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.410173176815549
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with negative property values.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which can also contribute to a negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
- An alkene group (CC(C)=C), which is less common in the examples but can influence the property value depending on its context.

Based on the examples, molecules with nitro groups and electron-withdrawing groups like trifluoromethyl tend to have negative property values. Considering these structural features and their influence, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.5. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.5.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 1.0191658586611316
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. It has a relatively simple structure with a small alkyl group (isopropyl) and a formate group. In the examples, we have several small molecules with similar functional groups:

1. CC(C)CCOC=O, -0.02740109: This is a similar ester with a slightly larger alkyl group.
2. CCC(C)(C)O, 0.47353145: This is a tertiary alcohol with a similar isopropyl group.
3. CCC(O)CC, 0.47353145: This is a secondary alcohol with a similar carbon chain length.

The ester CC(C)OC=O is smaller and less complex than CC(C)CCOC=O, which has a property value of -0.02740109. Given the trend that smaller and less complex molecules tend to have less negative or more positive property values, we can infer that CC(C)OC=O might have a slightly more positive value than -0.02740109.

Considering the examples and the structural features, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around 0.05.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.4775404066280096
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is structurally similar to c1ccccc1O (phenol), which has a property value of 0.30433851. The presence of additional methyl groups in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 could slightly alter the property value, but given the examples, the effect of methyl groups on aromatic rings tends to be relatively small.

Considering the examples and the structural similarity to phenol, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be slightly higher than that of phenol due to the additional methyl group, but not significantly so. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.35.

True Property: 0.6445028338508392
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is similar to the structure of some of the examples given. Specifically, it resembles the structure of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a property value of 0.46730466, and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, which has a property value of 1.5112335. Both of these molecules have a phosphorothioate group and a substituted aromatic ring.

The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) on the aromatic ring, which are electron-donating groups. This is different from the electron-withdrawing halogen groups in the examples, which could affect the property value.

Considering the electron-donating nature of the substituents and the structural similarity to the examples, the property value is likely to be somewhat lower than the example with halogen substituents. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 would be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a chlorinated biphenyl, similar to some of the examples given.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 2.14595417, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 3.09319466. The target molecule, Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is a chlorinated biphenyl with a similar structure but fewer chlorine atoms than the latter example.

Considering the trend that more chlorine atoms tend to increase the property value, the target molecule should have a property value between these two examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 2.5.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 1.03752505272587
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a nitroalkane, specifically a nitropropane. The nitro group (N(=O)=O) is known to be an electron-withdrawing group, which can influence the overall property value. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have higher property values, often positive, due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group.

For instance, the molecule CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a high property value of 1.42451089, which is influenced by the presence of multiple nitro groups. However, simpler structures with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, have a negative property value of -0.78084341, likely due to the overall molecular structure and other substituents.

Considering the structure of CCCN(=O)=O, which is a relatively simple nitroalkane, the property value is likely to be influenced by the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group, but not to the extent of more complex or heavily substituted nitro compounds.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be slightly positive, reflecting the influence of the nitro group but moderated by the simplicity of the molecule. Therefore, I would predict a property value around 0.5.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.24517635964586418
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, similar to the example Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, which has a property value of -0.56153678. 

Both molecules are halogenated benzenes, with the main difference being the presence of a fluorine atom in the target molecule instead of a chlorine atom. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which could influence the property value slightly. However, given the similarity in structure, the property value is likely to be close to that of Clc1ccc(Br)cc1.

Taking into account the electronegativity and potential electronic effects of fluorine, the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 might be slightly more negative than -0.56153678. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be approximately -0.58.

True Property: -0.7642093684112556
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:

1. Molecules with alcohol groups (e.g., CCC(C)(C)O, CC(C)(C)CO) tend to have property values around 0.0 to 0.5.
2. Bicyclic structures with additional functional groups (e.g., CC1CCCO1) have a property value of 0.70751568.
3. The presence of a tertiary alcohol group, as seen in some examples, can slightly increase the property value.

Given these observations, the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group, which suggests a property value slightly above 0.5. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.6.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)
- An amide linkage (N2C(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)

Comparing this structure to the examples:
- The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O has a similar phosphorothioate group and an amide linkage, with a property value of 5.28497974.
- The presence of the phenyl ring is common in many examples, often contributing to a range of property values.

Given the structural similarity to the example with a property value of 5.28497974, but without the additional sulfur-containing group (SC(CCl)), the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is likely to be slightly lower.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be approximately 4.8.

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: -0.6552981267635752
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzoyl group attached to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of 1.31382084. However, the given molecule is simpler and lacks the additional aromatic ring and nitrogen atoms present in the example.

Considering the presence of the aromatic ring and the carbonyl group, which are common in several examples with negative property values, and the fact that the molecule is less complex than the example with a positive value, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly negative.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around -0.3.

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.6346585728116028
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which is a linear chain with a total of 9 carbon atoms.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCCC(=O)OC, which is a similar ester with a slightly shorter chain, has a property value of -0.78683383.
- CCCCC, a linear alkane with 5 carbon atoms, has a property value of 0.63907133.
- CCCCCCCCI, a linear alkane with an iodine atom, has a property value of -0.79062243.

The presence of the ester functional group generally contributes to a more negative property value compared to simple alkanes. Given that CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar to CCCCCCCCI in terms of carbon chain length but with an ester group instead of an iodine, we can expect the property value to be in a similar range to other esters.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around -0.78.

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.4889937360376639
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is methyl benzoate, an ester with a benzene ring.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 with a property value of -0.7403046. This molecule is similar to methyl benzoate but has an additional hydroxyl group on the benzene ring, which can significantly affect the property value.
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 with a property value of -0.69393142. This molecule is ethyl benzoate, which is very similar to methyl benzoate, differing only by one additional carbon in the alkyl chain.

Given that methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1) is structurally similar to ethyl benzoate but with a slightly smaller alkyl group, we can expect its property value to be close to that of ethyl benzoate. The presence of the ester group and the benzene ring are the main contributors to the property value, and the difference in the alkyl chain length is relatively minor.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate) is approximately -0.69393142, similar to ethyl benzoate, but potentially slightly more negative due to the smaller alkyl group. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.70.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 0.6622447892806415
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the examples provided and look for patterns or similarities. The examples include a variety of molecular structures with different functional groups and their corresponding property values. 

The molecule C=CCC=C is a simple linear alkene with two double bonds. In the examples, simpler hydrocarbons and alkenes tend to have property values around zero or slightly positive. For instance, the molecule CC/C=C/C has a property value of 0.65063481, and CCC(C)(C)CC has a value of -0.26496042. 

Given the simplicity and the presence of conjugated double bonds in C=CCC=C, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly positive, reflecting the unsaturation and linearity of the molecule. 

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C would be approximately 0.5.

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 0.05569900867495813
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br, also known as tribromomethane or bromoform, is a simple halogenated compound with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples, halogenated aromatic compounds like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 have a property value of -0.76694323, and Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of -0.79214794. These values are negative, indicating that the presence of halogens in aromatic systems tends to result in negative property values.

However, BrC(Br)Br is not aromatic; it is a simple halogenated methane derivative. The example FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br, which is a halogenated alkane, has a positive property value of 0.71065903. This suggests that simple halogenated alkanes might have positive property values.

Considering the simplicity and high degree of halogenation in BrC(Br)Br, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value, but likely lower than that of FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br due to the absence of fluorine, which is highly electronegative and can significantly influence the property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 4.85209383.
- An amide linkage (N-C=O) within a cyclic structure, similar to the example CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O, which has a property value of -0.33323802.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is a feature in several examples with varying property values.

Considering these features, the molecule has a combination of polar functional groups and aromatic rings, which tend to increase the property value. However, the presence of the phosphorothioate group, which is associated with a high property value in the example, suggests that the property value for this molecule might be relatively high.

Taking into account the structural similarities and the property values of the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 4.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A dimethylamide group (CN(C)C(=O)), which is similar to the structure in CN(C)C(=O)C, which has a property value of 0.7429092.
- A chloro-substituted aromatic ring, which is similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O with a property value of -0.50708535.
- A heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen, which is somewhat similar to Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2 with a property value of -0.55196938.
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C), which is similar to CCC(C)C with a property value of 0.64767801.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the molecule has a mix of electron-withdrawing groups (like the chloro and nitro groups) and electron-donating groups (like the dimethylamide and tert-butyl groups). The presence of the chloro and nitro groups tends to lower the property value, while the tert-butyl and dimethylamide groups tend to increase it.

Balancing these effects, the predicted property value for CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C is likely to be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the electron-withdrawing groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately -0.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether. It has two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with three chlorine atoms attached to the rings. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, which has a property value of -0.7922739. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings generally contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in the examples.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of chlorine atoms, I would predict that the property value for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is likely to be in the negative range, similar to the example with multiple chlorines. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately -0.75.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC/C=C\C, we can look at the examples provided and identify similar structures. The molecule CC/C=C\C is a linear alkene with four carbon atoms, also known as 2-butene.

In the examples, the molecule CC/C=C/C, which is also a linear alkene with four carbon atoms (2-butene), has a property value of 0.65063481. Since CC/C=C\C is essentially the same molecule as CC/C=C/C, just with a different stereochemistry (cis vs. trans), we can reasonably predict that the property value for CC/C=C\C will be very similar.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C is approximately 0.65063481.

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 0.4510953210291845
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCOCC is a linear chain with an ether functional group. 

Looking at the examples, we can find some similar structures:
- CC(C)O has a property value of 1.76402957. This molecule is a simple alcohol.
- CCC(O)CC has a property value of 0.47353145. This molecule is a secondary alcohol.
- CC(C)COC(=O)C has a property value of -0.02740109. This molecule is an ester.

The molecule CCCOCC is an ether, which is generally less polar than alcohols and esters. The property values for alcohols and esters in the examples range from slightly negative to positive, with ethers likely being closer to the lower end of this range due to their lower polarity.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be slightly positive, but lower than the alcohols and esters. Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCOCC could be around 0.2.

To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a tertiary amide with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 2.70285501. Both molecules contain a tertiary amide and phenyl groups, which contribute to the overall property value.

Considering the structural similarities, particularly the presence of aromatic rings and the amide linkage, the property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be in a similar range to the example with a value of 2.70285501.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be approximately 2.7.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-), which is a polar functional group.
- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1), which is an aromatic ring with a bromine substituent.

From the examples:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents, such as Fc1cccc(Br)c1 (-0.24517636) and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (-0.40980871), tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of an acetamide group, as seen in CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 (0.83885507), can contribute to a positive property value, but this is in a different context with additional aromatic rings.

Considering the balance between the polar acetamide group and the bromobenzene moiety, the property value is likely to be slightly negative, similar to other halogenated aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately -0.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the data. The molecule in question is isobutylbenzene, which consists of an isobutyl group (CC(C)C) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1).

From the examples, we can observe the following:

1. Molecules with alkyl groups attached to benzene rings, such as Cc1ccccc1N (-0.35254472) and CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.62564301), tend to have negative property values.
2. The presence of additional alkyl groups, as seen in CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (-0.76476377), further decreases the property value.
3. The molecule Cc1cccc2ccccc12 (-0.79257702) also shows a negative property value, indicating that larger aromatic systems with alkyl groups tend to have lower values.

Considering these observations, the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is expected to have a property value similar to other alkyl-substituted benzene derivatives, likely in the negative range. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 would be around -0.6.

True Property: -0.059239945545934446
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have negative property values. For instance, NC(=O)c1ccccc1O has a property value of -0.4200679, and O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.59012887. These examples suggest that the presence of electron-withdrawing groups on an aromatic ring tends to decrease the property value.

Benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, attached to a benzene ring. Based on the trend observed in the examples, we can predict that the property value for benzaldehyde will be negative, but not as negative as those with multiple or stronger electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) would be around -0.3.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.7350474908034036
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is often associated with negative property values in the examples.
- An oxazole ring (c1ccc(o1)), which is a heterocyclic aromatic compound.
- An imide group (O=C2CN...C(=O)N2), which can influence the property value depending on its context.

Looking at the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2, tend to have negative property values.
- Aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds, such as c2ccc1[nH]nnc1c2, also tend to have negative or slightly negative values.
- The presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups, like nitro and carbonyl groups, generally leads to more negative values.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is likely to be negative. Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction would be around -0.5 to -0.7. Therefore, a specific predicted value could be:

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.43811245626349393
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group (N-N linkage).

Looking at the examples, we have a similar structure: N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -0.60083419. The difference between the two structures is that the example has a double-bonded nitrogen (azo group), while the target molecule has a single-bonded nitrogen (hydrazine group).

The presence of the azo group in the example might contribute to a slightly more negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature compared to the hydrazine group. Therefore, we can expect the property value for the hydrazine compound to be slightly less negative than -0.60083419.

Taking this into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be around -0.55.

1. Polychlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a property value of 2.71629588.
2. Simple chlorinated benzenes like Clc1ccccc1Cl have a property value of -0.40980871, indicating that the addition of more chlorine atoms generally increases the property value.

Given that Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a more complex structure with three chlorine atoms, we can expect its property value to be higher than that of a simple dichlorobenzene but potentially lower than the highly chlorinated example with a value of 2.71629588.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 1.5 to 2.0. Therefore, a specific predicted value could be:

- Alkyl-substituted aromatics like CCCc1ccccn1 (ethylpyridine) have a property value of -0.20773767.
- Linear alkanes and simple ethers tend to have property values around -0.7 to 0.2.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a relatively simple aromatic hydrocarbon with two ethyl groups, it is likely to have a property value similar to other simple aromatic hydrocarbons. Considering the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be around -0.2 to -0.3.

To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a sulfonamide derivative, which is similar to some of the other aromatic compounds with functional groups in the examples.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O consists of a benzene ring with a sulfonamide group attached. In the examples, aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.47337991, and Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.74979491.

The sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is also electron-withdrawing, similar to the nitro group, but it might not be as strongly electron-withdrawing as two nitro groups. Therefore, we can expect the property value to be negative, but not as negative as the compound with two nitro groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be around -0.5. This is consistent with the trend observed in the examples for aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups.

Given the structure of the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, which includes multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone, it is likely to have a positive property value. The presence of the ketone and the additional aromatic ring could increase the property value compared to simpler structures like Oc1cccc(O)c1.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)O), an amide group (NC(C)=O), and a thioether linkage (SC). Let's consider the following:

1. **Phosphorothioate Group**: The example COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a phosphorothioate group and a property value of 0.46730466. The presence of a phosphorothioate group might contribute positively to the property value.

2. **Amide Group**: The example CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has an amide group and a property value of -0.77249334. Amide groups can contribute negatively to the property value.

3. **Thioether Linkage**: The presence of sulfur in thioether linkages can influence the property value, but there are no direct examples with a simple thioether linkage to compare.

Considering these structural features and their potential contributions, the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is likely to have a property value that is slightly positive due to the phosphorothioate group, but moderated by the presence of the amide group.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around 0.3.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two carbonyl groups and a small, rigid ring structure. In the examples, molecules with multiple carbonyl groups and cyclic structures tend to have positive property values, especially when they are part of a larger, complex structure. However, this molecule is relatively small and lacks additional functional groups or aromatic systems that might significantly increase the property value.

Considering the examples, smaller cyclic structures with carbonyl groups, such as CC(=O)C(C)(C)C (0.09711207) and C1CCCCC1 (0.34827067), have property values around zero or slightly positive. Given the diketopiperazine's small size and lack of additional complex features, it is reasonable to predict a property value close to zero.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.5853731518130342
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring, with a nitro group (NO2) also attached to the ring.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have negative property values. For instance, O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.59012887.
- Compounds with methoxy groups attached to aromatic rings, such as c1ccccc1O, have a positive property value of 0.30433851.

The molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has both a methoxy group, which can contribute to a positive property value, and a nitro group, which can contribute to a negative property value. The presence of the nitro group is likely to have a stronger influence due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

Considering these factors, the property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is likely to be negative, but not as negative as compounds with multiple nitro groups or without the methoxy group. A reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.4.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. This molecule is a highly chlorinated polycyclic compound, similar to some of the other chlorinated compounds in the examples.

From the examples, we can observe that highly chlorinated compounds tend to have negative property values, often due to their electron-withdrawing nature and potential for high molecular weight. For instance, ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl has a property value of -0.5638885, and Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of -0.7922739.

Given the high degree of chlorination and the polycyclic structure of the molecule in question, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and likely in a similar range to these examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl would be approximately -0.75.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 1.016128789851423
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with halogens or nitro groups tend to have more negative property values.
- Simple hydrocarbons or those with triple bonds often have positive property values.
- Esters and amides tend to have negative property values, but the magnitude can vary.

Given that CCCOC=O is a relatively simple ester without additional functional groups that might significantly alter its property value, we can compare it to similar structures in the examples. For instance, the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 has a property value of -0.78493248, but it is more complex due to the aromatic ring and amine group.

Considering the simplicity of CCCOC=O and the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be slightly negative, but not as negative as more complex esters or those with additional functional groups.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCOC=O could be around -0.2.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.4901968164914319
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a long-chain ester, specifically a decanoate ester, which is similar to some of the other molecules in the dataset that contain ester functional groups and long carbon chains.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with ester groups and long carbon chains, such as CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C (8.9362503) and CCCCCC(CC)C=O (-0.57216454), have varying property values. However, the presence of the ester group and the length of the carbon chain suggest that the property value might be positive, as seen in some of the examples with similar features.

Considering the structure of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, which is a simple ester with a long carbon chain, the property value is likely to be positive but not as high as the complex ester example with a value of 8.9362503. A reasonable prediction, based on the trend observed in the examples, would be around 1.0 to 1.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 1.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, also tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of chlorine atoms in aromatic rings, as seen in Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, can lead to positive or negative values depending on the overall structure.

Considering these factors, the molecule has structural similarities to those with negative property values due to the presence of the nitro group and amide linkage. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value.

Based on the analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be approximately -0.6.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- Two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are similar to the phosphorothioate group in the example molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 4.85209383.
- Aromatic rings connected by a sulfur atom, which is a feature that can contribute to a higher property value due to increased molecular complexity and potential for interactions.

Given the presence of two phosphorothioate groups and the aromatic structure, the molecule is likely to have a relatively high property value. The example with a single phosphorothioate group and aromatic structure has a high property value, suggesting that the presence of additional similar groups could further increase the value.

Therefore, based on the structural similarities and the trend observed in the examples, I would predict the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 to be approximately 5.5.

True Property: -0.294221921647268
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. The molecule in question is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

In the examples, we have the following similar structures:

1. Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which is a nitrotoluene, with a property value of -0.49192101.
2. Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, which is a chlorinated phenol, with a property value of -0.71629709.
3. Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, which is a chlorinated aniline, with a property value of -0.37093075.

The presence of the nitro group generally contributes to a negative property value, as seen in the nitrotoluene example. The phenol group also tends to contribute to a negative property value, as seen in the chlorinated phenol example.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (4-nitrophenol) is likely to be negative and somewhat similar to the nitrotoluene example, but possibly more negative due to the additional electron-withdrawing effect of the hydroxyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.5.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. This molecule is a complex sugar, likely a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide, given its multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic acetal structures.

From the examples, it seems that molecules with more complex and larger structures, especially those with multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic structures, tend to have property values that are not extremely high or low, often around zero or slightly positive. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O has a property value of 0.11235216, which is a simpler sugar-like structure.

Considering the complexity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, which can contribute to hydrogen bonding and solubility, I would predict a property value that is slightly positive but not very high. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around:

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 1.4820173142955553
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of molecular structures with different functional groups and sizes, and their property values range from negative to positive.

The molecule CCC#C is a simple alkyne, specifically 1-butyne, with a terminal triple bond. In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules, especially those with fewer functional groups and less aromatic character, tend to have property values closer to zero, often negative. For instance, CCC(C)C(=O)C has a property value of 0.09711207, and CCC(C)OC(=O)C has a property value of -0.38569755.

Given the simplicity and small size of CCC#C, along with the presence of a triple bond, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly negative, reflecting its relatively low complexity and lack of extensive functionalization.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C is approximately -0.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Presence of Chlorine (Cl) Substituents**: The molecule has three chlorine atoms attached to the aromatic ring. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings tend to have positive property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 2.14595417.

2. **Phosphorothioate Group (P=S)**: The presence of a phosphorothioate group (P=S) is similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 4.85209383. This suggests that the P=S group contributes positively to the property value.

3. **Ether Linkage (O-aryl)**: The molecule has an ether linkage connecting the phosphorothioate group to the aromatic ring. This feature is present in some examples with varying effects on the property value, but generally, it does not significantly lower the value.

4. **Alkyl Chains**: The presence of ethyl groups (CC) attached to the phosphorothioate group may contribute slightly to the property value, but their effect is likely minor compared to the other features.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the predicted property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be positive and relatively high due to the combination of multiple chlorine atoms and the phosphorothioate group.

A reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately **3.5**.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 contains a pyridine ring (a six-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen atom) and a hydrazide group (C(=O)NN). In the examples, molecules with nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as pyridine or pyrimidine, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 has a property value of -0.6015525, and Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2 has a property value of -0.55004272.

Additionally, the presence of the hydrazide group (C(=O)NN) could contribute to a more negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature, similar to other carbonyl-containing groups in the examples.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 will be negative and likely in the range of the other nitrogen-containing heterocycles.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is approximately -0.55.

True Property: 4.7115928325732375
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, which has a property value of 0.08309565.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is present in several molecules with varying property values.
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1), which is a saturated nitrogen-containing ring.

The presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a potential for a positive property value, as seen in the example with a similar group. The amide linkage and piperidine ring are common in molecules with both positive and negative property values, so their influence might be neutral or slightly positive.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be slightly positive, around 0.1 to 0.2.

Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately 0.15.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.5564782575861988
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (n-octane), we can look at the trends in the provided examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of functional groups, aromatic rings, and the overall size of the molecule.

In the examples, simple aliphatic hydrocarbons like CCCCCC (hexane) and CCCC/C=C/C (hexene) have negative property values, specifically -0.3696238 and -0.26317013, respectively. These values suggest that the property in question decreases with the simplicity and linearity of the hydrocarbon chain.

Given that CCCCCCCC (n-octane) is a simple, linear aliphatic hydrocarbon similar to hexane but with a longer chain, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and possibly slightly lower (more negative) than that of hexane due to the increased chain length.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (n-octane) would be approximately -0.4.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group and an alkyne group. It shares some structural similarities with the examples, particularly those with multiple rings and oxygen-containing functional groups.

Looking at the examples, molecules with complex polycyclic structures and oxygen functionalities, such as CC(=O)C1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C (property value: 4.2604564) and CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO (property value: 6.16631602), tend to have higher property values.

Given the structural complexity and the presence of an alkyne group, which is less common in the examples, the property value is likely to be significant but not as high as the most complex example. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C would be around 4.5.

True Property: 20.44103400603577
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like the one you've provided involves considering various structural features and their potential contributions to the property in question. The examples you've given suggest that the property might be related to some form of molecular descriptor or calculated property, such as a logP value, solubility, or a similar physicochemical property.

The molecule you've provided, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, is quite complex and appears to be a polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups.

Based on the examples, it seems that larger, more complex, and polycyclic structures with multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms tend to have higher property values. For instance, the example with a very high property value (15.04888255) is a large, complex molecule with multiple aromatic rings and functional groups.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, which might increase the property value due to potential interactions or solubility effects, I would predict a relatively high property value for this molecule. However, without a specific model or more context on what the property represents, this is a qualitative assessment.

Therefore, I would predict the property value for the given molecule to be approximately 10.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's consider the following examples:
- Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.29422192.
- Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O also has a property value of -0.29422192.
- Fc1ccccc1 has a property value of 0.49542276.
- Clc1ccccc1I has a property value of -0.74275636.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a phenol with a chlorine substituent. The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) and the chlorine atom will influence the property value. The examples with similar structures, such as phenols and halogenated benzenes, tend to have negative property values, except for the fluorobenzene example, which is positive.

Considering the influence of the hydroxyl group and the chlorine atom, the property value is likely to be negative, similar to the chlorinated and nitro-substituted phenols. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around -0.3 to -0.4.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl to be approximately -0.35.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C), which is a relatively small and polarizable group.
- An ester linkage (OC(=O)), which is polar and can contribute to a more negative property value.
- An amide group (NC(=O)), which is also polar and can contribute to a more negative property value.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1), which is similar to some of the chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with polar functional groups like esters and amides tend to have negative property values.
- Chlorinated aromatic compounds can have a range of property values, but they often contribute to a more positive value compared to non-chlorinated aromatics.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of polar functional groups, but the chlorinated aromatic ring might offset this to some extent.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around -0.6.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2) attached to the central carbon.
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have positive property values, especially when there are multiple chlorine atoms (e.g., Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl with a value of 2.71629588).
- The presence of heterocyclic rings like pyrimidine can influence the property value, as seen in Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2 with a value of -0.43052125.
- The combination of aromatic rings and halogen substituents generally leads to higher property values.

Considering these observations, the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl has multiple aromatic rings, two chlorine substituents, and a pyrimidine ring. These features suggest a positive property value, likely influenced by the presence of the halogens and the aromatic system.

Based on the trends and examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 1.5. This accounts for the positive influence of the chlorine atoms and the aromatic structure, balanced by the presence of the pyrimidine ring.

Looking at the examples, we have:
- CCCC(=O)OCC, which is an ester, with a property value of -0.03367103.
- CCCCCCC=O, which is a ketone, with a property value of 0.09035025.

The molecule CCCCCOC=O is more similar to CCCC(=O)OCC in terms of functional groups, as both are esters. The property value for CCCC(=O)OCC is slightly negative, suggesting that the presence of the ester group contributes to this value.

Considering the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for CCCCCOC=O would likely be close to that of CCCC(=O)OCC. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be approximately -0.03.

To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we can look at the example ClCCCl, which has a property value of 1.13774502. The molecule ClCCl is similar to ClCCCl but with one less carbon atom. This suggests that the property value for ClCCl might be slightly different due to the reduced size and potential changes in molecular interactions.

Given the trend in the examples, smaller molecules with similar structures tend to have slightly lower property values. Therefore, I would predict the property value for ClCCl to be slightly lower than that of ClCCCl.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be approximately 1.0.

True Property: -0.4775404066280096
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a methylphenol, specifically a cresol, which is a type of phenol with a methyl group attached to the benzene ring.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- Oc1cccc(O)c1 with a property value of 0.13272882, which is a dihydroxybenzene (a phenol with two hydroxyl groups).
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O with a property value of -0.78599185, which is a tert-butylphenol (a phenol with a tert-butyl group).

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is structurally similar to these examples, particularly to the phenol structures. The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) on the benzene ring is a key feature that influences the property value. The methyl group (CH3) is a relatively small substituent compared to the tert-butyl group, which suggests that the property value might be closer to that of a simple phenol rather than a more heavily substituted phenol.

Given these considerations, the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is likely to be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the hydroxyl group and the relatively small impact of the methyl group. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be around -0.3.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl, which is similar to the example Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 2.14595417. 

The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl has four chlorine atoms and a biphenyl structure, which is less chlorinated than the example with five chlorine atoms. The presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in the examples. Given that the molecule in question has one less chlorine atom than the example with a property value of 2.14595417, we can expect the property value to be slightly lower.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl would be around 1.8.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple hydrocarbon with a double bond and a branched methyl group.

Looking at the examples, we notice that simple hydrocarbons, especially those with double bonds or branching, tend to have negative property values. For instance:

- CCCCC(CC)C=O has a property value of -0.57216454.
- CCCCCC=C has a property value of -0.79235451.
- CCCCCCCC has a property value of -0.55647826.

These examples suggest that hydrocarbons with similar features (alkenes, branching) have negative property values. Given that CC=C(C)C is a small, branched alkene, it is reasonable to predict a similar negative property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be approximately -0.6.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1.8938980935018368
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule ClCCl is relatively simple, consisting of a small number of atoms and high chlorine content. In the examples, molecules with high chlorine content and simple structures tend to have property values around or slightly above zero. For instance, ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of 0.06812401, and ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl) has a property value of 2.02033743, but this latter molecule is much more complex.

Given the simplicity of ClCCl and its high chlorine content, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be slightly above zero. Therefore, I would predict the property value for ClCCl to be approximately:

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.7162970932146535
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (-0.71629709) and Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 (-0.78991287), tend to have negative property values.
2. The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) in aromatic systems, as seen in CC(=O)Nc1ccc(O)cc1 (-0.69431788) and c1(OC)ccc(CC=C)cc1 (-0.78567172), also correlates with negative property values.

Given these observations, the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, which contains both multiple chlorine atoms and a hydroxyl group, is likely to have a negative property value similar to the examples with similar structural features.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl would be approximately -0.72, aligning with the trend observed in similar chlorinated and hydroxylated aromatic compounds.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 20.44103400603577
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known molecules.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and hydroxyl groups. It resembles some of the more complex structures in the examples, such as those with multiple rings and oxygen-containing functional groups.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen atoms, which can contribute to hydrogen bonding and potentially increase solubility, the property value might be influenced by these factors. Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings and ether linkages can affect the electronic properties.

Based on the examples provided, complex polycyclic structures with multiple functional groups tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule with a property value of 5.22593494 is a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. Considering these aspects, the predicted property value for the given molecule might be in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 could be approximately 5.0.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.6069233561556082
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thioether group (CS), a pyrazole ring (nnc), a carbonyl group (C=O), and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). 

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar heterocyclic structures and functional groups tend to have negative property values. For instance:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a property value of -0.06760732.
- Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2 has a property value of -0.43052125.

Both examples contain nitrogen-rich heterocycles and carbonyl groups, similar to the target molecule. The presence of the tert-butyl group might slightly increase the property value, but not significantly enough to make it positive.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be around -0.1.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6939314160175403
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ethyl ester group attached to a benzene ring.

Looking at the examples, we have:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 with a property value of 4.85745804. This molecule is more complex due to additional functional groups and heteroatoms, which likely contribute to its higher property value.

2. CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O with a property value of -0.79234711. This molecule is a diketone with a benzene ring, which is somewhat similar in terms of aromatic content but has different functional groups.

3. CCOC(=O)N(C(C)C(=O)OC)c1c(C)cccc1C with a property value of 1.30519269. This molecule has an ester group and a benzene ring, similar to ethyl benzoate, but also includes additional functional groups that may affect the property value.

Considering the structure of ethyl benzoate and its similarity to the examples, particularly the presence of an ester group and a benzene ring, we can estimate that its property value will be closer to the simpler aromatic compounds with ester groups. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around -0.5. However, since the exact property value is not directly provided in the examples, this is an estimation based on structural similarity.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.6988491407509437
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the trends and characteristics of the given examples. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the size of the carbon chain, and the presence of halogens.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached. In the examples, linear alkanes and alkenes tend to have negative property values, while the presence of halogens like chlorine and bromine can increase the property value. For instance, the molecule Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of -0.76694323, which is relatively low, but this is an aromatic compound. The molecule CI has a high property value of 1.35689621, indicating that the presence of iodine significantly increases the property value.

Considering these trends, the presence of the bromine atom in CCCCCCCBr is likely to increase the property value compared to a similar alkane without a halogen. However, since the molecule is a simple linear alkyl bromide, the increase might not be as significant as in more complex or aromatic structures.

Based on these considerations, I would predict a property value slightly higher than that of a similar alkane without the bromine, but still likely negative due to the linear alkyl nature. A reasonable estimate for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around -0.3.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 3.4986627025481427
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide), we can analyze the given examples and their associated property values. The examples include a variety of organic and inorganic compounds with different functional groups and structural complexities. The property values range from negative to positive, indicating a diverse set of properties being measured.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is a small, non-polar molecule with no additional functional groups or complex structures. In the context of the examples provided, simpler molecules with fewer functional groups and lower molecular weights tend to have property values closer to zero, often slightly negative or positive.

Given this analysis and the nature of CO as a simple, small molecule, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be close to zero. Based on the trends observed in the examples, I would predict a slightly positive value for CO.

Predicted property value for CO: 0.10000000
