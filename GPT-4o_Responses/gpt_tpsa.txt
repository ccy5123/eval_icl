To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can look at similar structures in the examples provided. The molecule CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is an ester with a long alkyl chain, similar to the example CCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which has a property value of 26.3. Given the similarity in structure, particularly the ester functional group and the length of the carbon chain, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would also be 26.3.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 46.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxygen and a nitrogen atom, specifically a chlorinated isatin derivative.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings and heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and oxygen) tend to have higher property values compared to simple chlorinated hydrocarbons, which often have a property value of 0.0. For instance, the molecule Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C has a property value of 54.86, and it also contains a nitrogen and oxygen in a heterocyclic structure with chlorine.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of a heterocyclic aromatic ring with nitrogen and oxygen, and the presence of chlorine, the property value for Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is likely to be closer to those examples with higher values rather than 0.0.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around 54.86.

Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 43.14
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite, which contains a nitro group attached to an isopropyl group.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, tend to have higher property values. The example Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO has a property value of 81.19. However, the complexity and size of the molecule also play a role in determining the property value.

Given that CC(C)N(=O)=O is a relatively simple molecule with a single nitro group and a small alkyl chain, we can expect its property value to be lower than that of more complex nitro-containing molecules. Based on the pattern observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O would be around 43.09, similar to NC(=O)CCl, which also contains a simple structure with a functional group that contributes to the property value.

CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO

This molecule is a polycyclic compound with multiple rings and carbonyl groups. Let's break down the structure:

1. The molecule has a steroid-like structure with multiple fused rings, similar to some of the examples provided.
2. It contains two carbonyl groups (C=O), which are known to influence the property values in the examples.
3. The presence of hydroxyl (OH) groups and carbonyl groups suggests some degree of polarity.

Comparing this structure to the examples, particularly those with complex ring systems and carbonyl groups, we notice that such structures tend to have property values in the range of 30 to 75. For instance, the molecule with a similar complexity, CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C, has a property value of 34.14.

Given the structural complexity and the presence of functional groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 34.14, similar to the example with a comparable structure. Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO is approximately:

True Property: 58.2
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A fluorinated benzene ring (Fc1cccc(F)c1), which is similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of 0.0.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N), which is present in several molecules with higher property values, such as CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O with a value of 75.27.
- A chlorinated benzene ring (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), which is similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 0.0.

The presence of the amide linkage suggests a higher property value, as seen in molecules with similar functional groups. However, the presence of halogenated benzene rings, which often have a property value of 0.0, might lower the overall value.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a property value influenced by the amide linkage, but not as high as those with multiple amide groups or additional complex structures. A reasonable prediction, based on the examples, would be a property value around 38.77, similar to COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which also contains an amide linkage and a chlorinated benzene ring.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 is approximately 38.77.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with two carbonyl groups and a bromine atom. The presence of carbonyl groups and a bromine atom suggests some degree of polarity and potential for interactions, which could influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar functional groups and complexity, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (29.1) and CCN(CC)C(=O)CSc1ccc(Cl)nn1 (46.09), have property values in the range of 29 to 46. The presence of a bromine atom and carbonyl groups in the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O suggests it might have a property value closer to these examples.

Considering the structural features and comparing with the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O would be around 35.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples.

The given molecule is a cyclic compound with a urea-like structure, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of 75.27. The main difference between the two structures is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the given molecule.

Considering the structural similarity and the additional alkyl chain, which might slightly increase the property value due to increased molecular size or hydrophobicity, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be slightly higher than 75.27.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be around 80.
==================================================
Iteration: 13
SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1

These examples suggest that the presence of halogens on aromatic rings tends to result in a property value of 0.0.

Given that trifluoromethylbenzene has a similar structure with a halogenated aromatic ring, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be 0.0. Therefore, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is 0.0.

This molecule is a sugar, specifically a hexose, which is similar to glucose. The structure contains multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups, which are known to increase the property value in the examples given.

Looking at the example OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, which has a property value of 121.38, we can see that it is a sugar-like structure with multiple hydroxyl groups. The molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a cyclic form of a similar sugar, which suggests that its property value would be in a similar range.

Therefore, based on the structural similarity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is likely to be around 121.38.

2. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains ketone groups (C=O) and an ester group (CC(=O)O). These functional groups are also present in some of the examples, such as CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O with a property value of 66.48.

3. **Hydroxyl Group**: The presence of a hydroxyl group (C3(O)) can increase the property value, as seen in molecules like OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO with a high property value of 121.38.

Considering these structural features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule is likely to have a property value influenced by its cyclic nature, the presence of multiple functional groups, and the hydroxyl group. Given the complexity and the presence of these groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be in the range of the higher values seen in the examples.

Therefore, a predicted property value for the molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C could be approximately:

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of multiple rings and functional groups like the ketone and alcohol, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for this molecule would be similar to the example with a value of 40.46.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O is approximately 40.46.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an acetanilide derivative with a nitro group attached to the aromatic ring.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with nitro groups attached to aromatic rings tend to have higher property values. For instance:
- O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of 43.14.
- COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of 52.37.

The presence of an acetamide group (CC(=O)N-) in the molecule might also influence the property value. Comparing with similar structures:
- CNC(=O)C=C(C)OP(=O)(OC)OC has a property value of 73.86.
- CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1 has a property value of 32.34.

Considering the combination of the nitro group and the acetamide group, the property value is likely to be between the values of the simpler nitrobenzene and the more complex nitro-substituted structures.

True Property: 53.6
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)SC), which is not directly represented in the examples.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring, which in the examples often corresponds to a property value of 0.0.
- An oxazole ring (n1c(=O)oc2), which is a heterocyclic structure.

The presence of a chlorinated aromatic ring in the examples consistently results in a property value of 0.0. However, the presence of additional functional groups, such as nitro groups or other heterocycles, can increase the property value significantly.

Given the complexity of the molecule and the presence of a heterocyclic structure, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is not 0.0 but also not as high as those with multiple nitro groups or extensive conjugation.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be around 44.02, similar to the example with a brominated aromatic ring and a cyano group.

The molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is a bicyclic compound with two nitrogen-containing heterocycles, specifically a purine-like structure. In the examples, similar nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F and Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1, have property values of 71.77. These examples suggest that the presence of nitrogen heterocycles contributes significantly to the property value.

Given the structural similarity of O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 to these examples, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar. Therefore, the predicted property value for O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is 71.77.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, an ester. In the examples, simple esters like CCCOC(C)C have a property value of 9.23. The presence of the ester functional group and the relatively small size of the molecule suggest that the property value for CC(C)OC=O would be similar to that of other small esters.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O is 9.23.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings, such as phenyl groups, tend to have higher property values. For instance, Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1 has a property value of 37.3, and NC(=O)c1cccnc1 has a value of 55.98. The presence of additional functional groups like carbonyls and amides also seems to increase the property value.

Given that O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 has two phenyl groups and a central urea linkage, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be relatively high, similar to other aromatic compounds with additional functional groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 would be around 55.98, similar to NC(=O)c1cccnc1, which also contains an amide linkage and aromatic rings.

- An aromatic ring with an amine group, similar to some of the examples with moderate property values.
- A guanidine group (NC(=N)N), which is a polar and potentially reactive functional group.

- Molecules with aromatic amines, such as NNc1ccccc1 (38.05), also have moderate property values.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the predicted property value for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is likely to be in the moderate to high range. A reasonable prediction would be around 70.0.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with moderate to high property values.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) attached to the aromatic ring, which can increase the property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
- An alkene group (C=C) in the side chain, which is not present in the examples but could slightly influence the property value.

Based on the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (63.37) and Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O (84.6), tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of a trifluoromethyl group could further increase the property value, as seen in some fluorinated compounds.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be in the higher range. A reasonable estimate would be around 70.0.

Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a property like solubility, boiling point, or a similar characteristic. The examples show that molecules with similar functional groups or structural features tend to have similar property values.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. Looking at the examples, esters like CCC(C)CCOC=O and CCCCCCCOC=O have property values of 26.3. The presence of the ester functional group and the relatively small size of the molecule suggest that it would have a similar property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O is 26.3.

Iteration: 27
SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 20.23
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to the structure of c1ccccc1O (phenol) with a methyl group added.

The property value for phenol (c1ccccc1O) is given as 20.23. The addition of a methyl group to the phenol ring, as seen in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, is likely to have a small effect on the property value, as seen in other examples where small alkyl substitutions do not drastically change the property value.

Therefore, based on the examples and the structural similarity to phenol, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is likely to be close to 20.23. However, considering the slight increase due to the methyl group, a reasonable prediction would be slightly higher than 20.23, but not significantly so.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is approximately 26.02, which aligns with the value for a similar structure, Cc1cccc(N)c1, indicating a small increase due to the methyl group.

True Property: 27.69
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)O), which is similar to the phosphorothioate groups in the examples COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, all of which have a property value of 27.69. 

The aromatic ring in the target molecule has substituents: a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C). The presence of these groups is somewhat similar to the halogen substituents in the examples, which suggests that they might not significantly alter the property value from the phosphorothioate examples.

Given the structural similarities and the consistent property value of 27.69 for the phosphorothioate-containing examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is also 27.69.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 43.14
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property value is related to the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to a propyl chain (CCC). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have higher property values compared to simple hydrocarbons or halogenated hydrocarbons, which often have a property value of 0.0.

For instance, the molecule CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a property value of 89.52, and it contains multiple nitro groups. Another example, O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, has a property value of 129.42, with three nitro groups.

Given that CCCN(=O)=O has one nitro group, we can expect its property value to be lower than those with multiple nitro groups but higher than simple hydrocarbons. A reasonable prediction, considering the examples, would be a property value around 46.25, similar to Nc1ccccc1O, which also contains a nitrogen-containing functional group.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O is approximately 46.25.

To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that molecules with simple aromatic rings substituted with halogens (like Cl, Br, or F) tend to have a property value of 0.0. For instance, Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 and c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12 both have a property value of 0.0.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene ring with a bromine substituent. This structure is similar to the examples with halogenated aromatic rings that have a property value of 0.0.

Therefore, based on the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is 0.0.

Looking at the examples, we see that molecules with cyclic structures and alcohol groups, such as CCC(C)(C)O (20.23) and CCCCCCCC(C)O (20.23), tend to have property values around 20.23. The presence of a tertiary alcohol group and the bicyclic structure in the given molecule suggests it might have a similar property value.

Therefore, based on the structural similarities and the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is approximately 20.23.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 55.84
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), an amide linkage, and a phenyl ring, similar to some of the structures in the examples.

One of the examples, CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, has a property value of 55.84. This molecule also contains a phosphorothioate group and an amide linkage, along with a phenyl ring, which are similar features to the molecule in question. The main difference is the presence of a thioether linkage (SC) and a chloro group (CCl) in the example, which are absent in the molecule we are analyzing.

Given the structural similarities and the absence of additional functional groups that might significantly alter the property, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be close to that of the example with similar features.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is approximately 55.84.

True Property: 26.93
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzodiazepine-like structure, featuring a phenyl ring attached to a heterocyclic core with a carbonyl group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule CN2C(=C(O)c1ccccc1S2(=O)=O)C(=O)Nc3ccccn3, which has a property value of 99.6. However, the example molecule is more complex and contains additional functional groups that likely contribute to its higher property value.

Another example, O2c1ccccc1N(C)C(=O)c3cccnc23, has a property value of 42.43 and features a heterocyclic core with a carbonyl group and a phenyl ring, similar to the target molecule. This example is closer in complexity to the target molecule.

Considering these comparisons, the target molecule is likely to have a property value somewhat lower than 42.43 due to its simpler structure and lack of additional functional groups that could increase the property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around 34.89, similar to the example Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which also features a heterocyclic core with a carbonyl group and a phenyl ring.

Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a property like solubility, boiling point, or a similar characteristic. The examples with simple hydrocarbons or halogenated aromatics often have a property value of 0.0, while more complex structures with functional groups like carbonyls, hydroxyls, or amides tend to have higher values.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is an ester, specifically ethyl heptanoate. Comparing it to similar structures in the examples, such as CCCCCCC(=O)OC (26.3) and CCOC=O (26.3), it seems that esters with a similar chain length have a property value around 26.3.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is 26.3.

The molecule in question, COC(=O)c1ccccc1, is methyl benzoate. Looking at the examples, similar structures such as CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (ethyl benzoate) have a property value of 26.3. Given that methyl benzoate is structurally similar but slightly smaller than ethyl benzoate, it is reasonable to predict a slightly lower property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately 20.23.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a property like solubility, boiling point, or another physicochemical property. The examples with simple hydrocarbons or aromatic compounds without additional functional groups tend to have a property value of 0.0. 

The molecule C=CCC=C is a simple linear hydrocarbon with a conjugated diene structure. It does not have any functional groups that would significantly alter its property value compared to the simple hydrocarbons listed with a property value of 0.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for C=CCC=C is 0.0.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property value is often 0.0 for molecules that are relatively simple or have a symmetrical structure, especially those with halogen atoms like bromine or chlorine. The molecule BrC(Br)Br is a simple, symmetrical molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. This structure is similar to other halogenated compounds in the examples that have a property value of 0.0. Therefore, the predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br is 0.0.

True Property: 55.84
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is present in the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 38.77.
- A thioester linkage (SC(CCl)), which is similar to the thioester in the example COCCCNc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(SC)n1 with a property value of 71.96.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is a feature in several examples with varying property values.
- A bicyclic lactam structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O), which is similar to the structure in the example CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O with a property value of 29.54.

Considering these features and the property values of similar structures, the predicted property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is likely to be in the range of 30 to 70. Given the presence of the phosphorothioate and thioester groups, which tend to increase the property value, a reasonable prediction would be around 50.

Therefore, the predicted specific property value for the molecule is approximately 50.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 80.37
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A dimethylamide group (CN(C)C(=O)), which is similar to the structure in CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C with a property value of 23.55.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring, which is similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O with a property value of 43.14.
- A heterocyclic ring with a nitro group, which is similar to O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O with a property value of 86.28.
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C), which is a bulky substituent.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of the nitro group and the chlorinated aromatic ring suggests a higher property value. The tert-butyl group adds steric bulk, which might also influence the property.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be around 67.16, similar to Cc1cc(no1)C(=O)NNCc2ccccc2, which also contains a nitro group and aromatic features.

True Property: 29.46
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with three chlorine atoms attached. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Phenyl Rings**: The presence of phenyl rings is common in several examples, such as c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2 (0.0) and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 (0.0). These examples suggest that phenyl rings with chlorine substituents often have a property value of 0.0.

2. **Chlorine Substituents**: The molecule has three chlorine atoms. In the examples, Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl (20.23) and Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (20.23) both have multiple chlorine atoms on a phenyl ring and have a property value of 20.23.

3. **Ether Linkage**: The presence of an ether linkage (O-) between two phenyl rings is similar to the structure of the molecule in question. However, the examples do not provide a direct comparison for an ether linkage between two chlorinated phenyl rings.

Considering these points, the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is structurally similar to the examples with multiple chlorine atoms on phenyl rings, which have a property value of 20.23. Therefore, the predicted property value for this molecule is:

20.23

Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
The molecule "CC/C=C\C" represents a linear alkene with four carbon atoms, specifically 2-butene. In the examples provided, simple hydrocarbons such as alkenes and alkanes (e.g., "CC/C=C/C" and "CCCC(C)C") have a property value of 0.0. Based on this pattern, the predicted property value for "CC/C=C\C" is 0.0.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property value is related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some aspect of the molecule's complexity, functional groups, or other structural features. 

The molecule CCCOCC is a simple linear ether with no complex functional groups or rings. In the examples, simple linear or branched alkanes and ethers like CC(C)O and CCC(O)CC have a property value of 20.23. Given the simplicity and similarity of CCCOCC to these examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CCCOCC is also 20.23.

Iteration: 44
SMILES: CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 32.34
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

This molecule is a tertiary amide with two phenyl groups and a tert-butyl group. It resembles the structure CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 42.43. The main difference is the presence of a tert-butyl group instead of a methoxycarbonyl group attached to the nitrogen.

The tert-butyl group is a bulky, non-polar substituent, which might slightly increase the property value due to increased steric bulk and hydrophobicity compared to the methoxycarbonyl group. However, the overall structure is still quite similar, with two phenyl rings and an amide linkage.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be slightly higher than 42.43, but not significantly so. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 45.0.
==================================================
Iteration: 45
SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 29.1
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an acetanilide derivative with a bromine substituent on the phenyl ring.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with a simple aromatic ring and halogen substituents, such as Fc1cccc(Br)c1 and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1, have a property value of 0.0.
- Molecules with an acetamide group, such as CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, have a property value of 20.31.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 combines features of both these types of structures: it has an acetamide group and a bromine substituent on the aromatic ring. Given the influence of the acetamide group in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be closer to those with acetamide groups rather than those with only halogenated aromatic rings.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately 20.23.
==================================================
Iteration: 46
SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property value is 0.0 for molecules that are primarily hydrocarbons with no significant polar functional groups or heteroatoms that would contribute to a higher property value. The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is a hydrocarbon with an isopropyl group attached to a phenyl ring, which is similar to other hydrocarbon examples given with a property value of 0.0. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is 0.0.
==================================================
Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 17.07
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we observe that simple aromatic compounds like benzene derivatives without additional functional groups tend to have a property value of 0.0. For instance, Cc1cccc2ccccc12 (naphthalene) and c1ccc2c(c1)cc3ccc4cccc5ccc2c3c45 (coronene) both have a property value of 0.0.

However, when functional groups like nitro, carbonyl, or hydroxyl are present, the property value tends to increase. For example, NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (salicylamide) has a property value of 63.32, and O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O (dinitrobenzene) has a property value of 86.28.

Benzaldehyde has a carbonyl group attached to the benzene ring, which is a significant functional group but not as electron-withdrawing or complex as nitro groups. Based on the examples, simpler carbonyl-containing aromatic compounds like CC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C have a property value of 43.37.

Considering the structure of benzaldehyde and the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 would be around 43.37, as it is a simple aromatic compound with a carbonyl group. However, given the simplicity compared to the example with a similar value, a slightly lower value might be more appropriate.

Therefore, the predicted property value for O=Cc1ccccc1 is approximately 40.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a feature seen in some of the examples with moderate property values.
- A heterocyclic structure with a lactam (cyclic amide) group, which is also present in some examples with moderate property values.
- An aromatic ring with a heteroatom (oxygen), which can influence the property value.

Based on the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and nitro groups tend to have moderate property values, often in the range of 40-60. The presence of a heterocyclic structure with a lactam group also suggests a moderate property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be around 50.0.
==================================================
Iteration: 49

The molecule you provided, N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, is similar in structure to the example molecule N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 24.72. Both molecules contain two phenyl rings connected by a nitrogen-containing linkage. The main difference is the type of nitrogen linkage: the example molecule has an azo group (N=N), while the molecule you provided has an amine linkage (N-N).

Given the structural similarity and the fact that both molecules have two phenyl rings, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 will be close to that of the example molecule. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately 24.72 for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a relatively small and compact structure with two amide groups and a cyclohexane ring. In the examples, similar cyclic structures with amide groups, such as O=C1N(COC(=O)CC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (property value 75.71) and O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC (property value 75.27), have property values in the mid-70s range.

Considering the structural similarity and the presence of amide groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 would be around 75.00.

In the examples you provided, molecules with similar structures, such as Clc1ccccc1Cl and Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, have a property value of 0.0. These examples suggest that the property being measured is likely related to the presence of certain functional groups or structural features that are absent in simple aromatic chlorinated compounds.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

In the examples, we have:
- Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) with a property value of 26.02
- CCCCCCc1ccccc1 (n-hexylbenzene) with a property value of 0.0
- CCc1ccccn1 (ethylpyridine) with a property value of 12.89

The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is similar to n-hexylbenzene in that it is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, but with two ethyl groups instead of a hexyl group. The property value for n-hexylbenzene is 0.0, indicating that simple alkyl-substituted benzenes tend to have low property values.

Considering the structure of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 and its similarity to n-hexylbenzene, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will also be low. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is 0.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a para-substituted aniline with a sulfonamide group. 

Looking at the examples, we see that nitro-substituted anilines, such as Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, have a property value of 69.16. The sulfonamide group is somewhat similar in terms of electron-withdrawing effects, though it might not be as strong as a nitro group. 

Considering the examples and the nature of the substituents, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be slightly lower than that of the nitro-substituted aniline. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 60.

The molecule you provided, c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon known as triphenylene. Based on the examples you provided, it appears that molecules with fully aromatic structures and no polar functional groups or heteroatoms tend to have a property value of 0.0. This is likely due to their non-polar, hydrophobic nature and lack of functional groups that would contribute to the property being measured.

Therefore, the predicted property value for triphenylene (c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34) is 0.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule in question appears to be a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone suggests a relatively high polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, which could increase the property value compared to non-polar or less polar compounds.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar features, such as multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings, tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Oc1cccc(O)c1 has a property value of 40.46, and the molecule Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 has a property value of 66.76.

Given the structure of the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, which includes multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be in the higher range, similar to the examples with multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic systems.

Therefore, I would predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately 66.76.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar functional groups and complexity, such as those containing phosphorothioate or amide groups, tend to have property values in the range of 20 to 50. For instance, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of 27.69, and COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a value of 44.76.

Given the presence of the phosphorothioate and amide groups, and considering the overall molecular complexity, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around 35.

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 91.67999999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has several key features:
- An ester linkage (COC(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)
- An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23)
- A pyridine ring (ccnc)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with ester linkages, such as CCCOCC(=O)CC, have property values around 26.3.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2, have property values around 56.79.
- Chlorinated aromatic rings, such as Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl, have property values around 20.23.

The molecule in question is complex, with multiple aromatic rings and functional groups. It is similar in complexity to CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2, which has a property value of 56.79. Given the additional complexity of the pyridine ring and the chlorinated aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be slightly higher.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 would be around 60.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 20.23
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property value is related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a property like solubility, boiling point, or some other physicochemical characteristic. The examples with simple hydrocarbon chains or aromatic rings without additional functional groups tend to have a property value of 0.0. 

The molecule CCCCCO (1-pentanol) is a straight-chain alcohol. In the examples, molecules with simple structures and no polar functional groups, like CCCCCC (hexane), have a property value of 0.0. However, the presence of an alcohol group (OH) introduces polarity and hydrogen bonding capability, which could increase the property value.

Given the presence of the alcohol group and comparing it to similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be around 20.23, similar to other small alcohols or polar compounds in the list.

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 72.47
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is a polar functional group.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is also polar.
- An aromatic ring (phenyl group), which is common in several examples.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which is less polar than the sulfonyl and amide groups.

From the examples, molecules with polar functional groups like amides, sulfonyls, and ethers tend to have higher property values. For instance:
- Molecules with amide groups, such as O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC, have values around 75.27.
- Molecules with sulfonyl groups, such as CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, have values around 70.83.

Considering the presence of both a sulfonyl group and an amide linkage, along with an aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be relatively high. However, it may not be as high as the most complex examples with multiple polar groups and large aromatic systems.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be around 70.0.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:
- An ester group (COC(=O))
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring
- A bicyclic aromatic system
- Multiple carbonyl groups

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with nitro groups and aromatic systems tend to have higher property values. For instance:
- CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a property value of 89.52.
- CC2Cc1ccccc1N2NC(=O)c3ccc(Cl)c(c3)S(N)(=O)=O has a property value of 92.5.

The presence of multiple carbonyl groups and an ester group also suggests a higher property value, as seen in:
- CNC(=O)Oc1cccc(N=CN(C)C)c1 with a property value of 53.93.

Considering these factors, the molecule COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C is likely to have a relatively high property value due to the combination of aromaticity, nitro group, and carbonyl functionalities.

Based on the patterns observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 70.0.

True Property: 75.27
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It contains two amide groups and a cyclohexane-like structure due to the cyclization of the peptide bond.

Looking at the examples, molecules with significant cyclic structures and multiple functional groups, such as amides or carbonyls, tend to have higher property values. For instance, molecules with multiple carbonyl groups and cyclic structures like ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O have a property value of 63.24.

Given the presence of two carbonyl groups and the cyclic nature of the diketopiperazine, it is reasonable to predict a moderately high property value. However, it is not as complex or large as some of the highest value examples, so it should be lower than those.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around 40.46, similar to other moderately complex cyclic structures with multiple functional groups.

The molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl contains multiple chlorine atoms and a pyridine ring. Given the pattern observed in the examples, it is likely that this molecule will also have a property value of 0.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is 0.0.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1

This molecule contains:

1. Aromatic rings: Three phenyl rings, which are common in several examples.
2. Phosphoryl group: The presence of a P(=O)(O)2 group, which is not directly seen in the examples but can be related to other functional groups like esters or amides.
3. Alkyl groups: Methyl groups attached to the aromatic rings.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with aromatic rings and additional functional groups like carbonyls, nitro, or halogens tend to have property values ranging from around 20 to 80. The presence of multiple aromatic rings and a phosphoryl group suggests a moderate property value.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of multiple aromatic rings with a phosphoryl group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 60. This is based on the similarity to other molecules with multiple aromatic rings and additional functional groups.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1 is approximately 60.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is often associated with increased lipophilicity and electron-withdrawing effects.
- An aromatic ring, which is common in many of the examples.
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle, specifically a piperidine-like structure with a ketone group.

From the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and additional functional groups like nitro or halogens tend to have higher property values. The presence of a trifluoromethyl group and a ketone in a cyclic structure might suggest a moderate to high property value.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 75.0.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: 52.37
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitrobenzene derivative with a methoxy group attached to the benzene ring. 

Looking at the examples, we have:
- O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O with a property value of 86.28, which is a dinitrobenzene.
- c1ccccc1O with a property value of 20.23, which is phenol.
- Oc2ccc1ncccc1c2 with a property value of 33.12, which is a hydroxyquinoline.

The molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is similar to nitrobenzene with an additional methoxy group. The presence of the nitro group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group, significantly affects the property value. The methoxy group is an electron-donating group, which might slightly lower the property value compared to a dinitro compound.

Considering these factors, the property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is likely to be between the values for phenol and dinitrobenzene. A reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 50.44, similar to the example of O=c2c(C3CCCc4ccccc43)c(O)c1ccccc1o2, which also contains aromatic and electron-withdrawing groups.

True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
The molecule ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is a highly chlorinated compound. Based on the examples provided, it appears that molecules with a high degree of halogenation, particularly chlorination, tend to have a property value of 0.0. This is likely due to the nature of the property being predicted, which seems to be related to the presence of certain functional groups or structural features that are not prominent in heavily chlorinated compounds.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is 0.0.

Iteration: 73
SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 26.3
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property value is often 0.0 for simple hydrocarbons and molecules without significant functional groups or polar features. However, when functional groups like carbonyls, nitro groups, or halogens are present, the property value tends to be higher.

The molecule CCCOC=O contains an ester functional group (COC=O), which is a polar group. In the examples, molecules with similar polar functional groups, such as esters or amides, tend to have non-zero property values. For instance, CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 has a property value of 52.32, and CNC(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc12 has a property value of 47.56.

Given this pattern, CCCOC=O is likely to have a non-zero property value due to the presence of the ester group. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be around 20.23, which is a common value for molecules with moderate polarity or functional groups.
==================================================
Iteration: 74
SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 26.3
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically a decanoate ester, with a long alkyl chain (10 carbon atoms) and an ethyl group attached to the ester functional group.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with long alkyl chains and simple ester or ether functionalities tend to have lower property values. For instance, CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 has a property value of 0.0, and CCCCOC has a property value of 9.23. The presence of the ester group in CCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC might increase the property value slightly compared to a simple alkane or ether.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is likely to be relatively low, similar to other simple esters or ethers with long alkyl chains. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 9.23.

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1), which is similar to the structure in Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (20.23).

- A nitro group (N(=O)=O), which is present in Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (43.14).
- Two chlorine atoms, which are present in several molecules with varying contributions.

The molecule is complex and contains multiple functional groups that contribute to the property value. Based on the examples, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings tend to have higher property values. The presence of chlorine atoms also tends to increase the property value.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be around 60.0.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1

This molecule contains two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O) attached to aromatic rings. The presence of these groups suggests a similarity to other molecules in the list that contain sulfur and phosphorus, such as:

- COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 38.77.
- CC(=O)N(S(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1)c2onc(C)c2C, which has a property value of 89.43.

The molecule in question has two phosphorothioate groups, which might increase the property value compared to the first example. However, it lacks the additional functional groups present in the second example that contribute to a higher property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 is likely to be between the values of the two examples mentioned. A reasonable estimate would be around 60.0.

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 63.37
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can see that the presence of a nitro group on a benzene ring tends to increase the property value. For instance, the molecule Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (nitrotoluene) has a property value of 43.14. The presence of a hydroxyl group (as in phenol) also affects the property value, as seen in NC(=O)c1ccccc1O, which has a value of 63.32.

Considering the structure of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, which combines both a hydroxyl group and a nitro group on a benzene ring, we can predict that its property value will be somewhat similar to the nitrotoluene example but slightly higher due to the additional influence of the hydroxyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be around 43.14, slightly adjusted upwards to account for the hydroxyl group. A predicted value could be approximately 45.00.

The molecule you provided, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, appears to be a complex carbohydrate, likely a polysaccharide or a derivative thereof. Based on the examples you provided, molecules with high degrees of hydroxylation and complex cyclic structures, such as carbohydrates, tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, which is a sugar-like structure, has a property value of 90.15.

Given the complexity and the number of hydroxyl groups in the molecule you provided, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would be relatively high, similar to or possibly higher than the example of C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O. Therefore, I would predict the property value for your molecule to be approximately 90.15.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we need to consider the patterns and trends from the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall complexity of the molecule.

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons or molecules with minimal functional groups tend to have lower property values, often around 0.0. For instance, molecules like Cc1ccc(C)c(C)c1 and Clc1ccccc1I have a property value of 0.0, indicating that simple aromatic or halogenated hydrocarbons are assigned this value.

Given that CCC#C is a simple alkyne without additional functional groups or complexity, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would also be 0.0, similar to other simple hydrocarbons in the examples. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCC#C is:

0.0

The presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a non-zero property value, while the chlorinated aromatic ring suggests a lower value. Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl would be around 38.77, similar to the example with a similar functional group and aromatic chlorination pattern.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are associated with certain structural features of the molecules. Molecules with complex structures, multiple functional groups, or heteroatoms tend to have higher property values, while simpler hydrocarbons or molecules with symmetrical halogen substitutions often have a property value of 0.0.

The molecule in question, c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, contains a pyridine ring (a nitrogen-containing aromatic ring) and a hydrazide group (C(=O)NN). The presence of the nitrogen atom in the aromatic ring and the hydrazide functional group suggests that this molecule is more complex than simple hydrocarbons or halogenated benzenes, which often have a property value of 0.0.

Considering the examples with similar complexity, such as Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2 (100.45) and COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1 (71.96), the property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is likely to be significant but not as high as those with multiple nitrogen atoms or additional complex functional groups.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Several alkyl chains

From the examples, molecules with similar functional groups and complexity, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1 (70.83) and Cn2c(=O)n(C)c1ncn(CC(O)CO)c1c2=O (102.28), have relatively high property values. The presence of the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage suggests a higher property value compared to simpler hydrocarbons or halogenated aromatics, which often have a property value of 0.0.

Considering the complexity and the presence of functional groups that tend to increase the property value, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around 60.0.

Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the property value is 0.0 for linear alkanes and simple cyclic hydrocarbons without additional functional groups or heteroatoms. The molecule CCCCCCCC is a linear alkane (octane), which is similar to other linear alkanes like CCCCCCCO (20.23) and CCCCCC1CCCC1 (0.0) in the examples. However, since CCCCCCCO has an alcohol group and is assigned a value of 20.23, and CCCCCC1CCCC1 is a cyclic alkane with a value of 0.0, it suggests that the presence of functional groups increases the property value.

Given that CCCCCCCC is a simple linear alkane without any functional groups, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCC is 0.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbonyl group (C=O), as well as an alkyne group (C#C). The presence of these functional groups and the overall complexity of the structure suggest that it might have a moderate to high property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar complexity and functional groups, such as CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O (property value: 37.3) and CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO (property value: 94.83), provide a range for comparison.

Given the structural complexity and the presence of both a hydroxyl and a carbonyl group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C would be around 50.0. This value reflects the influence of the functional groups and the polycyclic nature of the molecule, placing it between the examples with similar features.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 160.83
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings. The presence of methoxy (OC) and hydroxyl (O) groups suggests some degree of polarity, but the overall structure is quite large and complex.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with large, complex, and polycyclic structures, especially those with multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms, tend to have higher property values. For instance, molecules like "COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1" have a property value of 55.38, and "CCCC(C)C1(CC)C(=O)NC(=S)NC1=O" has a value of 58.2.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups in the target molecule, it is reasonable to predict a relatively high property value. However, the exact value is difficult to determine without a specific pattern or formula, but based on the examples, a value in the range of 50-80 seems plausible.

Therefore, I would predict the property value for the given molecule to be approximately 65.

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 20.23
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

In the examples, molecules with a benzene ring and halogen substituents, such as Clc1ccccc1I and Fc1ccccc1, have a property value of 0.0. Similarly, molecules with multiple halogen substituents on benzene rings, like Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, also have a property value of 0.0.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl has a benzene ring with a hydroxyl group (OH) and a chlorine atom (Cl) attached. The example Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, which has a hydroxyl group and a nitro group, has a property value of 63.37. However, the presence of a nitro group is likely contributing significantly to this higher value.

Given that Oc1ccccc1Cl has a hydroxyl group and a chlorine atom, and considering the examples with halogenated benzene rings having a property value of 0.0, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl will be closer to those examples with halogen substituents.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is 0.0.

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: 38.33
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule contains a chloro-substituted aromatic ring, an amide linkage, and an alkyne group. 

From the examples, we observe that molecules with aromatic rings and amide linkages tend to have non-zero property values, often in the range of 20 to 60. For instance, the molecule COc1ncnc2nccnc12 has a property value of 60.79, and FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O has a value of 20.31. The presence of halogens, such as chlorine, in aromatic rings often results in a property value of 0.0, as seen in Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl.

However, the presence of an amide group, as in CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1 with a property value of 29.1, suggests that the amide linkage contributes to a non-zero property value. The alkyne group (C#C) is less common in the examples, but it is not expected to significantly alter the property value compared to the aromatic and amide contributions.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 is likely to be in the range of 20 to 40. Given the presence of the amide group and the chloro-substituted aromatic ring, a reasonable prediction would be around 29.1, similar to the example with an amide linkage and an aromatic ring.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 is approximately 29.1.

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: 46.010000000000005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2).
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents often have a property value of 0.0, especially when they are simple aromatic compounds with no additional functional groups.
- The presence of additional functional groups like carbonyls, sulfonamides, or multiple heteroatoms tends to increase the property value.

In this molecule, the presence of the pyrimidine ring and the phenol group suggests a higher property value than simple aromatic halides, but not as high as those with multiple functional groups like carbonyls or sulfonamides.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl would be around 40.0.

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 26.3
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a property like solubility, boiling point, or a similar characteristic. The examples with simple aliphatic chains or halogenated compounds often have a property value of 0.0, while more complex structures with functional groups like nitro groups, carbonyls, or aromatic rings tend to have higher values.

The molecule CCCCCOC=O (pentyl formate) is an ester with a relatively simple aliphatic chain. Comparing it to similar structures in the examples, such as CCCCC(=O)OCC (26.3) and CCCCCCC=O (17.07), it seems reasonable to predict a property value in a similar range.

Given this analysis, I would predict the property value for CCCCCOC=O to be approximately 26.3.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the property value is 0.0 for molecules that are simple, small, and lack functional groups that might contribute to a higher property value. The molecule "ClCCl" (1,2-dichloroethane) is similar in simplicity to "ClCCCl" (1,1,2-trichloroethane), which has a property value of 0.0. Therefore, the predicted property value for "ClCCl" is 0.0.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some aspect of the molecule's physical or chemical properties. The molecule in question, Cc1cccc(C)c1O, is a methylphenol, specifically p-cresol.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar structures, such as CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, have a property value of 20.23. This suggests that the presence of an alkyl group and a hydroxyl group on a benzene ring tends to result in a property value around this range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is 20.23.

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 0.0

These examples suggest that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings leads to a property value of 0.0. Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is 0.0.

Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C

Molecules with only hydrocarbon chains or simple alkyl groups tend to have a property value of 0.0. The molecule CC=C(C)C is a simple hydrocarbon with a branched alkene structure, similar to other hydrocarbons in the examples that have a property value of 0.0. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC=C(C)C is 0.0.

Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property value is related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some aspect of the molecule's physical or chemical properties. Molecules with simple, non-polar structures or those that are symmetrical and lack functional groups tend to have a property value of 0.0. 

The molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane) is a small, symmetrical molecule with no polar functional groups beyond the chlorines, which are common in molecules with a property value of 0.0 in your examples. Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCCl is 0.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can look at the examples provided and identify patterns or similarities. The molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a chlorinated phenol, similar to the example Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a property value of 20.23. Given the structural similarity, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl would also be 20.23.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 160.83
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. The examples suggest that the property value is influenced by the complexity and functional groups present in the molecule.

The given molecule, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, appears to be a complex structure with multiple rings, ether linkages, and hydroxyl groups. This complexity is similar to some of the higher property values in the examples, such as the molecule with a property value of 189.53, which also contains multiple rings and hydroxyl groups.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, I would predict a relatively high property value for this molecule. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 150.

Iteration: 97
SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 73.8
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A thioether group (CS-)
- A pyrazole ring (1,2,4-triazole-like structure)
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- A tertiary butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

From the examples, molecules with heterocyclic rings and carbonyl groups tend to have higher property values. For instance:
- CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a property value of 69.56.
- Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2 has a property value of 71.79.

Both of these examples have heterocyclic rings and carbonyl groups, similar to the target molecule. The presence of a tertiary butyl group in the target molecule is also seen in the example with a property value of 69.56.

Considering these structural similarities, the predicted property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is likely to be close to these examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately 69.56.

Iteration: 98
SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 26.3
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some aspect of molecular complexity or a specific calculated property. The molecule you provided, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, is ethyl benzoate. 

Looking at the examples, simpler molecules or those with fewer functional groups tend to have lower property values, while more complex molecules with multiple functional groups or rings tend to have higher values. For instance, molecules with a single benzene ring and a few additional atoms or functional groups have property values in the range of 9 to 60.

Given that ethyl benzoate has a single benzene ring and an ester functional group, it is somewhat similar to the example CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, which has a property value of 34.14. However, ethyl benzoate is slightly simpler because it lacks the additional carbonyl group in the ring.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be slightly lower than 34.14. A predicted value of around 26.3 would be consistent with the trend observed in the examples.

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property value is related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some aspect of the molecule's reactivity, stability, or other chemical property. The examples with a property value of 0.0 tend to be simple hydrocarbons or molecules with symmetrical structures, while those with higher values often contain functional groups or heteroatoms that might increase the property value.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a simple alkyl bromide, which is a linear chain of seven carbon atoms with a bromine atom attached. This structure is relatively simple and does not contain any complex functional groups or aromatic rings that might significantly increase the property value.

Given the pattern observed in the examples, particularly with simple hydrocarbons and halogenated compounds, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CCCCCCCBr would be relatively low, possibly 0.0, similar to other simple halogenated hydrocarbons like CI, which also has a property value of 0.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr is 0.0.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 20.23
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a property like solubility, boiling point, or another physicochemical property. Many of the molecules with simple structures or those that are hydrocarbons have a property value of 0.0. 

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a simple diatomic molecule with no complex functional groups or hydrocarbon chains. Given the trend in the examples where simple molecules or those without complex functional groups have a property value of 0.0, it is reasonable to predict that CO would also have a property value of 0.0.
