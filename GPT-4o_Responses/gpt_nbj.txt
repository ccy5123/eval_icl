SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.43391592155474723
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The molecule is a linear alkyl ester, specifically a decyl acetate. 

From the examples, we observe that:
- Linear alkanes and their derivatives tend to have negative property values, with the magnitude increasing with chain length.
- Esters, such as COC(=O)c1cccnc1 (0.24674542) and CCOC(=O)CC (0.53179669), tend to have positive property values.

Given that CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a longer chain ester, we can expect its property value to be positive, but likely lower than that of shorter esters due to the longer alkyl chain, which tends to decrease the property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be around 0.3.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxo group and a nitrogen atom. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings and heteroatoms.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl and carbonyl groups) tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of heteroatoms like nitrogen and oxygen in a ring can also influence the property value, often leading to positive values.

Considering these observations, the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is expected to have a property value that is positive, but not extremely high, due to the balance of electron-withdrawing effects and aromatic stabilization.

Based on the trends from the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be approximately 0.5.

This molecule is a polycyclic compound with multiple rings and carbonyl groups, similar to some of the examples provided. Notably, it resembles the structure of steroids, which are complex polycyclic compounds.

From the examples, we can see that complex polycyclic structures with multiple rings and carbonyl groups tend to have negative property values. For instance:

- Cc1cc2c3ccccc3ccc2c4ccccc14: -0.73313499
- C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13: -1.16792032
- CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C: -2.00196643

Given the complexity and the presence of carbonyl groups, the property value is likely to be negative. Considering the structural similarity to the last example, which is a steroid-like structure with a highly negative value, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be in the same range.

It is similar in structure to other small aliphatic ethers and alcohols in the examples, such as CCCC(C)CO (0.20719331) and CCCCCCO (-0.72939118). The presence of the ether group (COC) and the overall aliphatic nature suggest that the property value might be slightly positive or close to zero, as ethers and alcohols tend to have moderate property values.

Considering the examples and the structural similarity, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C would be around 0.1.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. Let's analyze the structural features:

1. **Presence of Bromine (Br):** Bromine is a halogen, and its presence can influence the property value. In the examples, molecules with bromine, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, have a property value of 0.02562379.

2. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O):** The molecule has two carbonyl groups, which are polar and can affect the property value. In the examples, molecules with carbonyl groups, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, have a property value of 0.02562379.

3. **Aromatic Ring (Pyrrole):** The molecule contains a pyrrole ring, which is a five-membered aromatic ring with a nitrogen atom. In the examples, aromatic rings are common, and their presence can influence the property value.

4. **Alkyl Chain (CCC(C)):** The presence of an alkyl chain can also affect the property value. In the examples, simple alkyl chains, such as in CCC(C)CC, have a property value of 0.05962314.

Considering these structural features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O is likely to have a property value influenced by the presence of bromine, carbonyl groups, and the pyrrole ring.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.5049862565463299
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular geometry.

Biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic compound consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples provided, aromatic compounds with multiple rings, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67, which is a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a property value of -1.15865493. Similarly, Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34, another polycyclic aromatic compound, has a property value of -0.73313499.

Given that biphenyl is a simpler aromatic compound compared to these examples, we can expect its property value to be less negative. However, it is still likely to be negative due to the aromatic nature and the lack of polar functional groups that could increase the property value.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around -0.5. This value reflects its aromatic nature and the absence of additional functional groups that could significantly alter the property value.

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -1.0116292991896547
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include various types of hydrocarbons, aromatic compounds, and functionalized molecules with different substituents, each having a specific property value.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear alkane with a thiol group at the end. The presence of the sulfur atom (thiol group) is a key factor in determining the property value. In the examples, linear alkanes like CCCCCCC=C have a property value of -0.11202223, while functionalized alkanes with sulfur, such as COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O, have a higher property value of 2.63545705 due to the presence of multiple functional groups.

Considering the structure of CCCCCS, it is a simple linear alkane with a thiol group, which is less complex than the highly functionalized sulfur-containing example. Therefore, the property value is likely to be closer to that of a simple alkane but slightly higher due to the presence of sulfur.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be around 0.1.

From the examples, we can observe the following:
- Molecules with alcohol groups, such as CCCC(C)(O)CC, have relatively high property values (1.23660212).
- Branched alkanes, such as CCC(C)(C)C, also tend to have high property values (1.06045217).

Given that CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar to those of other alcohols and branched alkanes. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is likely to be around 1.0 to 1.2.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO is approximately 1.1.

The structure of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is a naphthalene ring system, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon. The examples show that aromatic and polycyclic structures tend to have property values around the range of 0.2 to 0.5, depending on the specific substitutions and structural features.

Given the similarity to the example Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, and considering the lack of additional substituents that might significantly alter the property, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 would be close to that of the similar naphthalene derivative.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately 0.425.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic imide, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of 0.43103241. The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the given molecule, which could potentially increase the hydrophobicity and slightly alter the electronic environment.

Considering the structural similarity and the effect of the additional alkyl chain, the property value is likely to be close to the example value but slightly adjusted due to the increased hydrophobicity. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be slightly higher than 0.43103241.

True Property: 0.4623269122808235
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group, which is electron-withdrawing due to the electronegativity of fluorine, can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like halogens (e.g., Cl, Br) attached to aromatic rings tend to have positive property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of 0.58856456, and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 also has a property value of 0.58856456.

Given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 will be positive and likely in a similar range to the halogenated aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is approximately 0.5.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a high property value of 2.3994887. This suggests that the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups significantly increases the property value.

Given that OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is similar in structure to the example with a high property value, we can predict that it will also have a relatively high property value. Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately 2.3994887.

This molecule is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Cyclic Structure**: The molecule contains multiple fused rings, similar to some of the examples provided, such as CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of -2.1516556. This suggests that complex cyclic structures with multiple rings tend to have negative property values.

2. **Functional Groups**: The presence of ketone groups (C=O) and an ester group (CC(=O)O) can influence the property value. In the examples, molecules with ketone groups, such as CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O, have a property value of 0.74589904, but this is in a different context with a different overall structure.

3. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (C3(O) and C(O)) can also affect the property value. In the examples, molecules with hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a positive property value of 2.3994887, but again, the context is different.

Considering the complexity and the presence of multiple rings and functional groups, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value, similar to other complex cyclic structures with multiple functional groups.

Based on these observations and comparisons, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately:

It resembles some of the more complex structures in the examples, such as CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of -1.92289903. This suggests that the presence of multiple rings and an alcohol group tends to result in a negative property value.

Considering the complexity and the presence of the alcohol group, which can contribute to a more negative value, I would predict that the property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O is likely to be in the negative range, similar to the example mentioned.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O contains an acetamide group (CC(=O)N) attached to a nitro-substituted benzene ring. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with nitro groups and aromatic rings.

For instance, the molecule O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of 0.49162121, and COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.75728817. Both of these molecules contain a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring, similar to the target molecule.

Considering the presence of the acetamide group, which might slightly reduce the property value compared to a simple nitrobenzene, we can estimate the property value to be somewhat lower than 0.75728817 but still positive, given the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O would be approximately 0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)SC)

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with chloro-substituted aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, such as Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (0.36180794) and Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (0.58856456).
- Molecules with heterocyclic structures containing nitrogen, such as CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 (-2.03347629), tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of sulfur, as in CSSC (-1.42194855), can also contribute to a negative property value.

Considering these factors, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the heterocyclic structure with nitrogen might lead to a negative property value, while the chloro-substituted aromatic ring might slightly offset this negativity.

Based on these observations, I would predict a slightly negative property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12. A reasonable estimate could be around -0.5.

These examples suggest that the presence of nitrogen atoms and the potential for hydrogen bonding contribute to a positive property value.

Given the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for the molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is likely to be positive and in a similar range to the examples with nitrogen heterocycles.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is approximately 1.1.

True Property: 0.17359497927026749
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, an ester. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Esters like CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC have a positive property value (2.25371039).
- Simple alcohols and ethers, such as CCCO and CCCOC, tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) in esters and ketones often results in positive property values, as seen in CCC(C)C(=O)C (1.17964514).

Considering these observations, the presence of the ester functional group in CC(C)OC=O suggests a positive property value. However, the relatively small size of the molecule compared to larger esters like CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC might result in a less pronounced positive value.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around 0.5.

For instance, the molecule c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon similar to triphenylene, has a property value of -0.99935024. This suggests that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values, likely due to their aromatic nature and the associated electronic properties.

Considering the structural similarity of triphenylene to the example c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1, we can predict that the property value for C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 will also be negative and in a similar range.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with sulfonamide groups, such as O=C1NCCN1c2ncc(s2)N(=O)=O, have negative property values.
- Aromatic amines like NNc1ccccc1 have slightly positive property values.

Considering these factors, the overall property value is likely to be negative due to the presence of multiple polar groups, despite the aromatic amine's potential positive contribution.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 would be around -0.8.

True Property: 1.9349168642735879
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with negative property values.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which can also contribute to a negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
- An alkene group (C=C) attached to the nitrogen, which is less common in the examples but could influence the property value.

Based on the examples, molecules with nitro groups and electron-withdrawing groups like trifluoromethyl tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.92991419, and it contains a nitro group and other electron-withdrawing features.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative and in the range of similar molecules with nitro and trifluoromethyl groups.

A reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately -0.85.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.17359497927026749
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, an ester. Esters generally have moderate to low polarity and are often less polar than alcohols or acids. In the examples, we have:

- CC(C)CCOC=O, which is an ester with a property value of 0.17332492.
- CCC(C)(C)O, an alcohol with a property value of 0.84714078.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is structurally similar to CC(C)CCOC=O but with a shorter carbon chain, which might slightly affect its property value. Given the examples, the property value for CC(C)OC=O is likely to be close to that of CC(C)CCOC=O but slightly lower due to the shorter chain.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be approximately 0.15.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 0.8417813122608622
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the examples given.

Looking at the examples, we have:
- c1ccccc1O (phenol) with a property value of 0.56767417.
- Cc1cccc(C)c1 (dimethylbenzene) with a property value of 0.67449076.

The target molecule, Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, is a combination of these two structures: a phenol with an additional methyl group. The presence of the hydroxyl group (O) typically increases the property value, as seen in the phenol example. The additional methyl group might slightly increase the property value compared to phenol alone.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would likely be slightly higher than that of phenol but not as high as the dimethylbenzene example. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.6 to 0.7.

A specific predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is approximately 0.62.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.34632101989852593
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question has a phosphorothioate group (P=S) with methoxy groups (OC) and a substituted aromatic ring. The examples with similar phosphorothioate structures, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, all have property values around 0.64808162.

The key difference in the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is the presence of a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) on the aromatic ring, instead of halogens. The presence of the thiomethyl group could slightly alter the electronic properties compared to the halogenated examples, but the overall structure is still quite similar.

Given the similarity in structure to the examples with known property values, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 will be close to those examples. Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately:

0.64808162

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we can observe that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have property values around 0. For instance:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.05889441.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.27141661.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is similar in structure to these examples, with multiple chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings. Based on the trend observed, the property value for this molecule is likely to be close to the values of the similar chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be approximately 0.1.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.206123426997196
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to the end. The presence of the nitro group is significant because it is an electron-withdrawing group, which can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have higher property values. For instance, CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a property value of 1.85626119, and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O has a property value of 1.26321073. These examples suggest that the presence of nitro groups contributes positively to the property value.

However, the molecule CCCN(=O)=O is simpler and has fewer nitro groups compared to the examples mentioned. Therefore, its property value is expected to be lower than those examples but still positive due to the influence of the nitro group.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 0.5.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent. 

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Halogenated benzenes (e.g., Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, COc1ccccc1Cl) tend to have property values around 0.4 to 0.6.
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups tends to increase the property value (e.g., Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, 0.53333665).
- The presence of multiple halogens or more complex structures tends to decrease the property value (e.g., Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, -0.18937689).

Given that Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a simple halogenated benzene with one fluorine and one bromine, it is reasonable to predict a property value similar to other halogenated benzenes. Therefore, a predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be around 0.5.

True Property: -0.6207354845364524
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with an additional methyl group and a hydroxyl group. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with cyclic and bicyclic structures.

Looking at the examples, we see that cyclic and bicyclic structures with alcohol groups tend to have positive property values, such as:

- CCCCC(C)(C)O, 0.82052973
- CC(C)(C)CO, 0.84714078

However, the presence of additional rings and the specific arrangement of the bicyclic structure can influence the property value. The molecule in question is more complex than a simple alcohol but less complex than some of the larger bicyclic structures with negative values.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is likely to be positive but not as high as the simpler alcohols. A reasonable estimate would be around 0.5.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -0.518212647390944
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC) and a cyclic imide structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O). This structure is somewhat similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of -0.86333847. The main difference is the substitution of the sulfur atom (S) with a nitrogen atom (N) in the cyclic structure.

Considering the structural similarity and the fact that the substitution of sulfur with nitrogen might slightly affect the property value, we can predict that the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O will be close to -0.86333847, but possibly slightly less negative due to the presence of nitrogen instead of sulfur.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be approximately -0.85.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of -0.56019366. Both molecules contain aromatic rings and nitrogen heterocycles, but the example molecule has an additional aromatic ring and a more complex structure.

Given the structural similarities and the fact that the example molecule has a more complex structure, we can predict that the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C will be in a similar range but slightly less negative due to its simpler structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be approximately -0.5.

True Property: 0.6264281594936748
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which is a linear chain with a total of 9 carbon atoms.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCC, a linear alkane with 5 carbons, has a property value of -1.0116293.
- CCCCCS, a linear chain with 5 carbons and a sulfur atom, also has a property value of -1.0116293.
- CCCCCCCCI, a linear chain with 8 carbons and an iodine atom, has a property value of -0.36639592.
- CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, a linear chain with 9 carbons and an ester group, has a property value of 0.43517177.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar to CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, but with one less carbon in the main chain. The presence of the ester group tends to increase the property value compared to simple alkanes. Given the trend observed in the examples, the property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is likely to be positive and somewhat close to the value for CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 0.4.

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.24674541662299065
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the examples provided.

The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is methyl benzoate, an ester with a benzene ring. In the examples, we have several molecules with aromatic rings and ester groups:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1, with a property value of 0.05878292.
2. CCOC(=O)c1cncn1C(C)c2ccccc2, with a property value of -0.8199832.
3. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, with a property value of -0.05666276.

The third example, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, is ethyl benzoate, which is very similar to methyl benzoate, differing only by one carbon in the alkyl chain of the ester group. The property value for ethyl benzoate is -0.05666276.

Given the structural similarity between methyl benzoate and ethyl benzoate, we can predict that the property value for methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1) will be very close to that of ethyl benzoate. Therefore, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.05666276.

True Property: -0.13240052430167842
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of molecular structures with different functional groups and degrees of unsaturation, which influence their property values.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, also known as 1,3-butadiene. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons and those with double bonds tend to have property values around zero, with some variation depending on the specific structure and presence of additional functional groups.

For instance, the molecule CC/C=C/C (a linear hydrocarbon with a double bond) has a property value of -0.19084541. Similarly, CCC(C)(C)CC (a branched hydrocarbon) has a property value of 1.21199338, indicating that branching and saturation can increase the property value.

Given that C=CCC=C is a simple linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, it is reasonable to predict a property value close to zero, slightly negative due to the unsaturation and lack of branching.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C is approximately -0.15.

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: -0.7584780452032995
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their properties. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular size and complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br, also known as bromoform, is a simple halogenated compound with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon. In the examples, halogenated compounds tend to have positive property values, likely due to the high electronegativity and polarizability of halogens, especially bromine.

For instance, the molecule FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br has a property value of 1.5555883, which is relatively high, likely due to the presence of multiple halogens. Similarly, other halogenated aromatic compounds like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 have positive property values.

Given the simplicity and high bromine content of BrC(Br)Br, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. Considering the examples and the nature of bromoform, a predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br could be around 1.5. However, since it is a simpler molecule compared to FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br, the value might be slightly lower.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S) with ethoxy groups (OCC).
- A thioester linkage (SC).
- A chloro-substituted carbon (CCl).
- An amide linkage (N2C(=O)).
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1).
- A cyclic imide structure (C2=O).

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with halogen substitutions (Cl, F) tend to have positive property values, especially when multiple halogens are present.
- Molecules with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups (C=O) often have negative property values, especially when combined with other electron-withdrawing groups.
- The presence of sulfur (S) in thioester or phosphorothioate groups can influence the property value, often leading to more negative values.

Considering these factors, the molecule has a combination of features that could lead to a slightly negative property value due to the presence of the carbonyl groups and the aromatic ring, despite the presence of the chloro group which might slightly increase the value.

Based on these observations and the trends from the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around -0.5.

   - The molecule contains an amide group (C(=O)N), which is present in several examples with varying property values.
   - It has a chloro-substituted aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (0.53333665) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (1.17724393).
   - The molecule also contains a nitro group (N=O), which is present in examples like O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (0.53856227).
   - The presence of a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C) is similar to CC(C)N(=O)=O (1.01649641).

2. **Overall Structure**:
   - The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that can influence the property value.
   - The combination of electron-withdrawing groups (Cl, N=O) and electron-donating groups (amide) can affect the overall electronic distribution.

3. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - The presence of both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups suggests a balance that might lead to a moderate property value.
   - The examples with similar functional groups and complexity tend to have property values around 0.5 to 1.0.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be around 0.6.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with chlorine atoms attached to each ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, which has a property value of 1.39278252. However, the example molecule has more chlorine atoms, which generally increase the property value due to their electron-withdrawing nature.

The molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has three chlorine atoms, similar to the example O=N(=O)c1c(Cl)c(Cl)ccc1, which has a property value of 1.04689931. The presence of the ether linkage in the target molecule might slightly reduce the property value compared to a fully chlorinated phenyl ring.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is likely to be slightly above 1.0, but less than 1.39278252. A reasonable estimate would be around 1.2.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC/C=C\C, we can look at the example provided for a similar molecule, CC/C=C/C, which has a property value of -0.19084541. The only difference between the two molecules is the stereochemistry around the double bond, which is unlikely to have a significant impact on the property value in this context. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C would be approximately the same as for CC/C=C/C.

True Property: -0.729391178214291
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their corresponding property values.

The molecule CCCOCC is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with an ether linkage (C-O-C) in the middle. This structure is similar to simple aliphatic ethers and alcohols, which tend to have property values around zero or slightly negative in the given examples.

For instance:
- CCC(O)CC has a property value of 0.05962314.
- CCCCNC(=O)n1c(NC(=O)OC)nc2ccccc12 has a property value of -0.70824519, but this molecule is more complex and contains additional functional groups.

Given the simplicity of CCCOCC and its similarity to other small aliphatic ethers or alcohols, we can predict that its property value will be close to zero, likely slightly negative due to the presence of the ether linkage.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC is approximately -0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a tertiary amide with two phenyl groups and a tert-butyl group attached to the nitrogen. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of -2.03347629. Both molecules contain a tertiary amide and phenyl groups, but the example molecule has an additional heterocyclic ring and a sulfur atom, which could influence the property value.

The presence of the tert-butyl group in the molecule to be predicted might increase the hydrophobicity compared to the example, potentially leading to a less negative property value. However, the overall structure still suggests a relatively low property value due to the presence of the amide and aromatic groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be slightly less negative than -2.03347629, but still in the negative range. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -1.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-), which is a polar functional group.
- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1), which is an aromatic ring with a bromine substituent.

From the examples:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents, such as Fc1cccc(Br)c1 and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1, have positive property values (0.67449076).
- Molecules with acetamide or similar polar groups, such as CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, tend to have negative property values (-0.51456361).

Considering the combination of these features, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative due to the presence of the polar acetamide group, but not as negative as those with multiple polar groups or additional electron-withdrawing groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around -0.2.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with alkyl groups attached to benzene rings, such as Cc1ccccc1N (0.78321946) and CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (0.30173212), tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of additional alkyl groups, as seen in CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (0.3249352), also results in positive values.

Considering these trends, the presence of an isobutyl group attached to a benzene ring in CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 suggests that the property value will likely be positive and similar to those of other alkylbenzene compounds.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 would be approximately 0.35.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:

1. Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have higher property values, often above 1.
2. Molecules with multiple halogens, especially chlorines, tend to have high property values, often above 1.
3. Simple hydrocarbons, especially those with alkyl groups, tend to have lower property values, often negative or close to zero.
4. Molecules with carbonyl groups (C=O) attached to aromatic rings, like NC(=O)c1ccccc1O, have moderate property values around 0.8.

Benzaldehyde has a carbonyl group attached to an aromatic ring, similar to NC(=O)c1ccccc1O, which has a property value of 0.81758609. However, benzaldehyde lacks the additional hydroxyl group present in that example, which might slightly lower its property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) would be around 0.7.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -1.2403394459862827
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with negative property values.
- An aromatic ring with a heteroatom (oxygen), similar to some examples with negative property values.
- A cyclic imide structure (O=C2CN...C(=O)N2), which is not directly present in the examples but can be related to other cyclic structures with negative property values.

Based on these observations and the trends in the examples, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value. Considering the structural complexity and the presence of electron-withdrawing groups, a reasonable prediction would be a moderately negative value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is approximately -1.0.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -1.4547736866992345
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group (N-N linkage).

Looking at the examples, we have:

- N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 with a property value of -1.07106452. This molecule is an azo compound with two phenyl rings connected by a nitrogen double bond (N=N).
- Nc1ccccc1 with a property value of 0.56767417. This is an aniline, a single phenyl ring with an amino group.
- Nc1ccccc1O with a property value of 0.81758609. This is a phenol with an amino group, showing a similar trend to aniline.

The molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally similar to the azo compound but with a single bond (N-N) instead of a double bond (N=N). The presence of two phenyl rings and the nitrogen linkage suggests that the property value might be influenced by the aromaticity and the nitrogen linkage.

Considering the examples, the azo compound has a negative property value, while the aniline and phenol derivatives have positive values. The diaryl hydrazine structure might have a property value closer to the azo compound due to the presence of two aromatic rings and the nitrogen linkage, but potentially less negative due to the single bond.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be around -0.8.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a relatively small and rigid structure with two amide bonds and a cyclohexane ring. In the examples, similar cyclic structures with amide bonds, such as C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1, have a property value of -0.72062259. Another example, O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, has a property value of 0.61437414.

Considering the structural similarities, particularly the presence of amide bonds and a cyclic structure, the property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be in a similar range. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.7 to -0.8.

Therefore, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure. In the examples, we have:

1. Clc1ccccc1Cl, with a property value of 0.78321946.
2. Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, with a property value of -0.47273448.

The first example is a simple dichlorobenzene, while the second is a more complex chlorinated aromatic compound with additional chlorine atoms and a more complex structure, resulting in a negative property value.

The target molecule is structurally more similar to the second example, as it is a more complex chlorinated aromatic compound than the first example. However, it is not as complex as the second example, which has additional chlorine atoms and a tertiary carbon center.

Considering these factors, the property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is likely to be negative but not as low as -0.47273448. A reasonable prediction would be around -0.3 to -0.4.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately -0.35.

True Property: 0.14148457671525685
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Simple aromatic compounds with alkyl groups, such as Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) with a property value of 0.78321946, tend to have positive property values.
2. Molecules with longer alkyl chains or additional functional groups tend to have varying property values, but simple hydrocarbons or those with minimal functionalization often have values around or slightly above zero.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a relatively simple aromatic hydrocarbon with two ethyl groups, it is likely to have a property value similar to other simple aromatic hydrocarbons. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be slightly positive, reflecting its similarity to other alkyl-substituted benzenes.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is approximately:

True Property: 0.9099172343375195
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a sulfonamide derivative, which is similar to some of the nitroaromatic compounds in the examples.

The molecule contains an aromatic ring with a sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) attached. In the examples, aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have positive property values, as seen in examples like Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (0.53333665) and Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (1.18349412).

Given the presence of the sulfonamide group, which is also electron-withdrawing, we can expect a similar effect on the property value. However, the sulfonamide group might not be as strongly electron-withdrawing as the nitro group, so the property value might be slightly lower than those of the nitroaromatic compounds.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be around 0.5.

These values are negative, indicating that the property in question tends to be negative for such structures.

Given the structural similarity of triphenylene to these examples, we can reasonably predict that the property value for c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 will also be negative and likely within a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately -1.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the other polycyclic aromatic compounds in the examples, particularly those with multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings, such as Oc1cccc(O)c1 (0.67449076) and Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 (-1.31636588), have varying property values depending on the specific structure and functional groups present.

Given the structure of the target molecule, which includes multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group within a polycyclic aromatic framework, it is likely to have a property value that is negative, similar to other complex aromatic structures with multiple functional groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 would be around -1.0. This is based on the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and the overall complexity of the structure, which tends to lower the property value in the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)O)
- An amide linkage (NC(C)=O)
- A thioether linkage (SC)

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, have a property value of 0.64808162.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1, have a property value of 0.02562379.
- Molecules with thioether linkages, such as CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, have a property value of -0.42195294.

Considering these structural features and their associated property values, the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is likely to have a property value that is influenced by the presence of the phosphorothioate group, which tends to have a positive contribution, and the amide and thioether linkages, which may have a neutral to slightly negative contribution.

Balancing these influences, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around 0.3.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.3300278387899034
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is a simple alkene with two chlorine atoms attached to the carbon-carbon double bond. In the examples, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly chlorine, tend to have a range of property values. For instance, the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of 0.85320088, while Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.05889441. These examples suggest that the presence of chlorine atoms can lead to a positive or slightly positive property value.

Considering the simplicity of Cl\C=C/Cl compared to the more complex aromatic structures in the examples, and the fact that it is a small molecule with two chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly positive but not as high as the more complex aromatic chlorinated compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl is approximately 0.1.

To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and their properties. Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle with a nitrogen atom in the ring, similar to benzene but with one carbon replaced by nitrogen.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as CNc1ccccc1 (aniline) with a property value of 0.20769868, and c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 (quinoline) with a property value of -0.21383981, tend to have property values around zero, slightly positive or negative.

Considering pyridine's structure and comparing it to these examples, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be close to zero, likely slightly negative due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitrogen atom.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccncc1 (pyridine) is approximately -0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has several key features:
1. A benzene ring (c1ccccc1) attached to an amide group (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23).
2. A chlorinated aromatic ring, which often contributes to a positive property value.
3. An ester linkage (COC(=O)), which can contribute to a negative property value.
4. A polyol moiety (OCC(O)CO), which is similar to the sugar alcohols that tend to have positive property values.

Comparing these features with the examples:
- Molecules with chlorinated aromatic rings, like Clc1ccc(I)cc1 (0.58856456) and Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (1.39278252), tend to have positive property values.
- Molecules with ester linkages, like CCCOC(=O)CC (0.5052007) and CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC (0.5221487), also have positive property values.
- Molecules with polyol structures, like OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO (2.3994887), have significantly positive property values.

Considering these factors, the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 is likely to have a positive property value due to the presence of the chlorinated aromatic ring and the polyol moiety, despite the potential negative contribution from the ester linkage.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.5.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.729391178214291
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol, specifically 1-pentanol. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Linear alkanes and alcohols tend to have positive property values. For instance, CCCCCC (hexane) has a property value of 0.69100502.
- The presence of an alcohol group (OH) in a linear chain, as seen in OC1CCCCCCC1 (cycloheptanol), has a negative property value of -1.13674324, but this is a cyclic structure, which might influence the property differently compared to a linear structure.

Considering these observations, CCCCCO, being a linear alcohol, is likely to have a property value that is positive but possibly lower than that of a simple alkane due to the presence of the alcohol group. However, it should not be as negative as the cyclic alcohol example.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO (1-pentanol) would be around 0.5.

- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is also polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which can contribute to stability and hydrophobic interactions.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can add some polarity.

From the examples, molecules with polar groups and aromatic rings tend to have a range of property values, often positive but not extremely high. For instance:
- Molecules with sulfonyl groups, like CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C, have a property value of 0.62102856.
- Molecules with amide linkages, like CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1, have a property value of 0.02562379.

Considering these factors, the presence of both polar and aromatic features in the molecule suggests a property value that is likely positive but not extremely high. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be around 0.3.

This molecule contains several key features:
- An ester group (COC(=O))
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring
- A bicyclic structure with aromatic characteristics
- Multiple carbonyl groups

From the examples, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, such as:
- CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, 1.7409645
- Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, 0.53333665

However, the presence of multiple carbonyl groups and the ester functionality can influence the property value towards a more negative range, as seen in:
- CC1=C(CCCO1)C(=O)Nc2ccccc2, -1.20923667
- OC4=C(C1CCC(CC1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(=O)c3ccccc3C4=O, -2.21572067

Considering these factors, the molecule's property is likely to be slightly negative due to the influence of the carbonyl and ester groups, despite the presence of the nitro group and aromatic system.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately -0.5.

In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules, such as CCC (propane) and CC#N (acetonitrile), have property values around -1.0 to -0.5. Additionally, molecules with a single chlorine atom, such as Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene), have positive property values.

Considering the simplicity of ClCC and the presence of a chlorine atom, we can predict that its property value will be slightly negative, but closer to zero compared to more complex structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be around -0.5.

1. Halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have negative property values. For instance:
   - Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl has a property value of -0.42685231.
   - ClCCl has a property value of -2.07155559.
   - ClC(Cl)Cl has a property value of -0.75847805.

2. The presence of multiple halogen atoms, especially heavier halogens like bromine, tends to result in more negative property values compared to lighter halogens like chlorine.

3. The structure of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl, but with bromine instead of chlorine, which might suggest a more negative value due to the higher atomic mass and polarizability of bromine.

Considering these observations, the property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to be negative and possibly more negative than similar chlorinated compounds. A reasonable prediction for the property value of 1,4-dibromobenzene (Brc1ccc(Br)cc1) would be around -0.5 to -1.0.

Considering the pattern from the examples, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms tends to increase the property value, but the exact number and position of chlorine atoms can affect the value. Since the given molecule has fewer chlorine atoms than the example with a property value of 0.57803127, we can expect the property value to be somewhat lower.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be slightly lower than 0.57803127. A predicted value could be around 0.4 to 0.5. However, without a precise model or additional data, this is an estimation.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to be electron-withdrawing and can affect the molecule's polarity and solubility.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to increase the property value, as seen in O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O with a property value of 0.53856227.
- Methoxy groups (OCH3) also tend to increase the property value, as seen in c1ccccc1O (phenol) with a property value of 0.56767417.
- The combination of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups can have a complex effect on the property value.

Given these observations, the presence of both a methoxy group and a nitro group on the benzene ring suggests a moderate increase in the property value compared to a simple benzene ring. Therefore, the predicted property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to the values of other nitro and methoxy-containing compounds.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is approximately 0.5.

For instance, CCCCC(CC)C=O has a property value of 0.89831449, and CCCCCC=C(CC)C=O has a property value of 1.6829077. These examples suggest that the presence of a carbonyl group and a long aliphatic chain contributes to a positive property value.

Given the structure of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, which is a decanoate ester, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly positive, similar to the other long-chain esters and hydrocarbons.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 0.9.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.36639592191884474
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (n-octane), we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of functional groups, aromatic rings, and the overall size and shape of the molecule.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Simple aliphatic hydrocarbons like CCCCCC (hexane) have a property value of -0.36639592.
- Molecules with more branching or functional groups tend to have more positive or more negative values depending on the nature of the groups.

Given that CCCCCCCC is a straight-chain alkane with no functional groups, it is expected to have a property value similar to other simple alkanes. Since it is slightly larger than hexane, it might have a slightly more negative value due to increased hydrophobicity and van der Waals interactions.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (n-octane) would be slightly more negative than that of hexane. A predicted value could be around -0.4 to -0.5. Let's choose a specific value:

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as functional groups, molecular size, and overall molecular geometry. The given examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, ring structures, and the degree of unsaturation.

The molecule in question, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, contains multiple cyclohexane rings, a ketone group, a hydroxyl group, and an alkyne group. The presence of these features can influence the property value in different ways:

1. **Cyclohexane Rings**: These contribute to the hydrophobic character and can lower the property value, as seen in other cyclic hydrocarbons.
2. **Ketone Group (C=O)**: This polar group can increase the property value due to its ability to engage in dipole-dipole interactions.
3. **Hydroxyl Group (O)**: This polar group can also increase the property value due to hydrogen bonding potential.
4. **Alkyne Group (C#C)**: This unsaturated group can contribute to a higher property value due to its electron-rich nature.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, the presence of both polar and non-polar groups suggests a balance that might lead to a property value that is not extremely high or low. Given the complexity and the presence of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups, a moderate negative value might be expected.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C would be approximately -1.5.

- CCCCCCCC (a linear alkane) has a property value of -0.36639592.
- CC(C)CCC(C)(C)C (a highly branched alkane) has a property value of 1.06045217.

Given that CC=C(C)C is a small, branched alkene, it is likely to have a property value slightly above zero, similar to other small hydrocarbons with some degree of branching.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around 0.1.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -2.0715555858337034
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane), we can analyze the given examples and their associated property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular structure.

Dichloromethane is a small, simple molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a central carbon. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl, tend to have positive property values. This suggests that the presence of chlorine atoms might contribute positively to the property value.

Given this trend, and considering the simplicity and small size of dichloromethane compared to the more complex chlorinated compounds in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be a positive value, but likely smaller than those of larger chlorinated compounds.

Therefore, a predicted property value for ClCCl could be around 0.5.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 1.1772439286707685
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided dataset. This molecule is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

In the dataset, we have a similar molecule: Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which is 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, with a property value of 1.11713836. The structure of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is identical to this molecule, as both represent the same chemical structure.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is 1.11713836.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -2.669849052628284
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known molecules.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and hydroxyl groups, as well as aromatic rings. The presence of these functional groups and the overall complexity of the structure suggest that it might have a negative property value, similar to other complex polycyclic and aromatic structures in the examples.

Given the examples, complex polycyclic structures with multiple oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have negative property values. For instance, molecules like O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 and O=C1N(COC(=O)CCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 have negative values.

Considering these observations, I would predict that the property value for the given molecule is likely to be negative, and a reasonable estimate might be around -1.5. However, without a specific computational model or further context, this is a qualitative prediction based on structural similarity to the provided examples.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 1.2816697907869326
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) atoms, along with the tert-butyl group, suggests a potential for moderate polarity and some steric bulk.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar functional groups and structural features tend to have property values around the range of -0.5 to -1.0. For instance, CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a property value of -0.81564947, which is somewhat similar in terms of having a heterocyclic nitrogen and sulfur-containing ring with a tert-butyl group.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be around -0.8. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is:

-0.8

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.05666275602925446
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ester group (COOC) attached to a benzene ring. Let's consider the examples:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 has a property value of -0.58254666. This molecule is more complex due to the presence of additional functional groups like sulfonamide and a heterocyclic ring.

2. CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of -0.06163988. This molecule is a diketone with a benzene ring, similar in aromatic character but with different functional groups.

3. CCCCC(=O)OCC has a property value of 0.64342459. This is a simple ester with a longer alkyl chain compared to ethyl benzoate.

4. CCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of 0.47566917. This is another simple ester with a longer alkyl chain.

Considering these examples, ethyl benzoate (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1) is structurally simpler than the first example and more similar to the third and fourth examples, which are simple esters. The presence of the benzene ring might slightly lower the property value compared to the aliphatic esters due to increased aromatic character.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be slightly lower than the simple aliphatic esters but not as low as the more complex molecules. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.3.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.36639592191884474
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom at the end. In the examples, linear alkyl chains tend to have property values around zero, with slight variations depending on the length and presence of functional groups. For instance, CCCCCCCO has a property value of -0.36639592, and CCCCCCCCOC(=O) has a property value of 0.95640522.

The presence of a bromine atom, which is a halogen, might slightly decrease the property value compared to a similar alkane without a halogen, as seen in the example of CI, which has a very low property value of -3.27475897. However, the effect of a single bromine atom is likely not as pronounced as multiple halogens or other functional groups.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the bromine atom. A reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around -0.2.

SMILES: CO
True Property: -3.2747589721483004
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for carbon monoxide (CO) based on the examples provided is challenging due to the lack of similar simple diatomic molecules in the dataset. However, we can make an educated guess by considering the general trends and properties of the molecules listed.

Carbon monoxide is a small, neutral, and non-polar molecule. In the dataset, smaller and less complex molecules tend to have property values closer to zero, especially if they are not highly polar or charged. For example, the molecule CCC (propane) has a property value of -2.07155559, which is quite negative, but it is a larger molecule compared to CO. On the other hand, the molecule CC#C (propyne) has a property value of -0.47004028, which is less negative and closer to zero.

Given that CO is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond and is less complex than most of the examples, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is closer to zero but slightly negative due to its small size and lack of significant polarity.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO would be approximately -0.5.
