SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 39.58230569959946
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a linear ester with a long carbon chain, specifically a decanoate ester.

From the examples, we can observe that similar linear esters and long-chain hydrocarbons tend to have property values that are positive and increase with the length of the carbon chain. For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of 309.3689928, which is a similar structure but with one more carbon in the chain.

Given this trend, we can predict that the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC will be slightly lower than 309.3689928 due to having one less carbon atom. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be approximately:

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -121.2857238783649
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a fused heterocyclic structure, specifically a chlorinated benzoxazole. This structure is somewhat similar to other aromatic and heterocyclic compounds in the examples, such as c1cncnc1 and Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl.

The examples show that chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values, while heterocyclic compounds can have negative values. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in the examples with multiple chlorines.

Given these considerations, the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 has one chlorine atom and a heterocyclic structure. It is likely to have a property value that is not as high as heavily chlorinated compounds but not as low as simple heterocycles without chlorine.

Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around 100 to 300. However, considering the specific structure and the influence of the chlorine atom, a more precise estimate would be approximately 150.

True Property: -895.1698071057408
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite, which contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O).

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:

1. Molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have negative property values. The example Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO has a property value of -106.00479974.

2. Simple hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values, such as CCC(C)CC (-923.21208199) and ClCC (-1131.5384883).

3. The presence of a nitro group seems to contribute to a negative property value, likely due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

Given these observations, the presence of the nitro group in CC(C)N(=O)=O suggests that the property value will be negative. Considering the structural simplicity and the presence of the nitro group, the property value is likely to be in the range of other small molecules with nitro groups.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O is approximately -100.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. The molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, similar to some of the examples given.

Based on the examples, molecules with complex polycyclic structures and multiple functional groups tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C has a property value of 1272.19223056, and it shares some structural similarities with the given molecule, such as the presence of multiple rings and carbonyl groups.

Considering these factors, I would predict that the property value for the molecule CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO is likely to be in a similar range to the example mentioned above. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 1200.

True Property: 1235.8219001079071
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A benzene ring with two fluorine atoms (similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of -346.85485957).
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N) connecting two aromatic rings.
- A second benzene ring with a chlorine substituent (similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -338.2671533).

The presence of halogens (F and Cl) and the amide linkage suggests that the property value will be influenced by these electronegative atoms and the polar amide group. The examples with halogens and amide groups tend to have negative property values, indicating a possible trend.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be around -400. This accounts for the combined effects of the fluorine and chlorine atoms, as well as the amide linkage, which are likely to contribute to a more negative property value compared to simpler aromatic compounds with similar substituents.

True Property: -769.3546211320137
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property value is influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the types of atoms present.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a relatively simple structure, consisting of a linear chain of carbon atoms with an ether functional group (OC) and a branching methyl group (C) attached to the central carbon. This structure is similar to other small aliphatic ethers and alcohols in the examples, which tend to have negative property values.

For instance, the molecule CCCO (butanol) has a property value of -904.24796468, and CCC(C)CO (a similar branched alcohol) has a property value of -769.35462113. Given that CCCOC(C)C is an ether and not an alcohol, it might have a slightly different property value, but it is still expected to be negative and in a similar range.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C would be around -800.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of halogens, especially bromine, tends to increase the property value. Additionally, carbonyl groups also contribute to higher property values. The presence of alkyl groups, such as the isopropyl group in this molecule, generally contributes to a lower property value, but the effect is less pronounced than that of halogens or carbonyl groups.

Considering these factors, the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O is likely to have a property value that is higher than those of simple alkyl chains or aromatic compounds without halogens or carbonyl groups, but lower than those with multiple halogens or extensive conjugation.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -268.95003486411656
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some aspect of molecular stability, reactivity, or another chemical property.

Biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic compound consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples, we have a few aromatic compounds with known property values:

1. Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1: 96.95549224
2. Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O: -95.8784227
3. Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34: 587.86840316

The first example is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and the third example is a naphthalene derivative. The second example is a nitro-substituted aromatic compound. The property values for these compounds vary significantly, likely due to differences in their structures and substituents.

Biphenyl is simpler than the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and does not have any substituents like the nitro group in the second example. Its structure is more similar to the first example, but without the additional complexity of the polycyclic structure.

Given the simplicity of biphenyl compared to the more complex aromatic structures in the examples, we can predict that its property value will be closer to the lower end of the range for aromatic compounds. However, it is still an aromatic compound, so it should not be as low as the nitro-substituted example.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around 100.

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -884.6202956012556
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of molecular structures with different functional groups and sizes, and their property values range from negative to positive.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a sulfur atom at the end. This structure is similar to the linear alkanes and alkenes in the examples, such as CCCCCCC=C (-537.91930311) and CCC1CCCCC1 (-672.81264666). These examples have negative property values, which suggests that linear hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values.

Considering the presence of sulfur, which is more electronegative than carbon and can influence the property value, we can expect the property value to be slightly different from a simple hydrocarbon chain. However, the overall structure is still similar to linear alkanes.

Based on this analysis, I predict that the property value for CCCCCS will be negative and in the range of the linear hydrocarbons provided in the examples. A reasonable estimate for the property value of CCCCCS is approximately -600.0.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with the structure of a primary alcohol attached to a branched alkane chain. In the examples, similar structures such as CCC(C)(C)C (a branched alkane) have a property value of -923.21208199, and CC(C)CC(C)O (a branched alcohol) has a property value of -769.35462113.

Given that CCCC(C)(C)CO is similar to CC(C)CC(C)O but with an additional carbon atom, we can expect the property value to be slightly more negative due to the increased size and mass of the molecule. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO would be slightly more negative than -769.35462113.

Based on this analysis, a predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO could be approximately -800.0.

- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a property value of 96.95549224.
- Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (another naphthalene derivative) has a property value of -249.56278309.

The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is structurally similar to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, which is also a naphthalene derivative with a methyl group. Given the similarity, we can expect the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 to be close to that of Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is a cyclic compound with a urea-like structure, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of 0.0.

The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the molecule we are predicting. This additional alkyl chain is likely to increase the property value slightly due to the increased molecular size and complexity.

Given the similarity to the example with a property value of 0.0 and considering the effect of the additional alkyl chain, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be slightly above 0.0. A predicted value could be around 50.0, accounting for the additional alkyl chain's contribution.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of halogens, especially fluorine, tends to increase the property value. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of 541.18897851, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1718.53177246. These examples suggest that halogenation, particularly with multiple halogens, significantly affects the property value.

Considering the trifluoromethyl group, which is highly electronegative and can have a substantial impact on the property value, we can predict that the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 will be higher than that of a simple benzene ring but lower than heavily halogenated compounds like Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around 600.

To predict the property value for the molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a sugar, specifically a hexose, which is a type of carbohydrate. 

From the examples, we can see that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (OH) and a cyclic structure, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a property value close to zero. This is likely due to the high degree of hydrogen bonding and the polar nature of the molecule, which tends to stabilize the structure and result in a property value near zero.

Given this analysis, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately 0.0.

This structure is somewhat similar to the example O=N(=O)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of -568.03878354. The presence of the acetamide group (CC(=O)N-) in the target molecule could influence the property value, potentially making it more negative due to the additional electronegative oxygen and nitrogen atoms.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of functional groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O would be slightly more negative than -568.03878354. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -600.0.

Predicting the property value for the given molecule, CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them with the examples provided. The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group, an aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent, and a thiazole-like structure.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents, such as Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 (393.54390091) and Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl (393.54390091), tend to have positive property values. Additionally, the presence of sulfur-containing groups, as seen in CSSC (-846.02850921), can influence the property value significantly.

Considering these factors, the presence of the phosphorothioate group, the aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent, and the thiazole-like structure, the property value is likely to be positive but not extremely high, as the sulfur and phosphorus groups may moderate the value.

- CCCCCCC(C)O, a longer chain alcohol, has a property value of -364.67459048.

Given that tert-butanol is a small alcohol, we can expect its property value to be in the range of other small alcohols. Since CC(C)CO has a property value of -1039.14130823, and tert-butanol is slightly more branched but similar in size, we can predict that the property value for CC(C)(C)CO will be slightly less negative than -1039.14130823.

True Property: 1452.9571966072415
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) attached to the aromatic ring, which is known to influence the property values significantly.
- An alkene group (C=C) in the side chain, which can also affect the property.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, often in the range of several hundred to over a thousand. The presence of a trifluoromethyl group, as seen in some examples, can further increase the property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be positive and relatively high, similar to other molecules with similar functional groups and structural complexity.

Based on the patterns observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O would be approximately 1200.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -904.6710991444203
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including functional groups and overall molecular size.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl acetate, which is a small ester. In the examples, small esters and similar compounds tend to have negative property values. For instance, CC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of -634.88441205, and CCCC=O has a property value of -1058.52856. These examples suggest that the property value for small esters is typically negative.

Considering the structure of CC(C)OC=O and comparing it to similar molecules in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around -600. This is consistent with the trend observed for small esters and similar compounds in the provided data.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -577.1169411186523
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is a relatively simple aromatic compound with a hydroxyl group and two methyl groups attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that simple aromatic compounds with hydroxyl groups, such as phenol (c1ccccc1O), have a property value of -846.90362822. The addition of methyl groups generally increases the property value, as seen in other examples with alkyl substitutions.

Considering the structure of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, which is similar to phenol but with two additional methyl groups, we can expect the property value to be slightly higher than that of phenol due to the presence of these electron-donating groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be around -800.0.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 924.7026693028909
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the data. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall complexity of the molecule.

The molecule in question, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, contains a thiophosphate group (P(=S)(OC)O), a methoxy group (OC), and a benzene ring with a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) as substituents.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with similar thiophosphate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, have relatively high property values (1767.75000389 and 2219.73454419, respectively). These molecules also contain halogenated benzene rings, which contribute to their high property values.

The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of 1340.27841238, which is lower than the previous two examples but still significant. This suggests that the presence of the thiophosphate group and the benzene ring with substituents contributes to a higher property value.

In the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, the substituents on the benzene ring are a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C), which are less electronegative and less bulky compared to halogens. This suggests that the property value might be lower than those of the halogenated examples.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 would be somewhat lower than 1340.27841238, but still significant due to the presence of the thiophosphate group. A predicted property value could be around 1200.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound, specifically a dichlorinated biphenyl. The examples provided include several chlorinated aromatic compounds, and their property values tend to be positive and relatively high, likely due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms which contribute significantly to the property value.

For instance:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1718.53177246.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 2049.77874034.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has four chlorine atoms, similar to the first example, but fewer than the second example. Therefore, its property value is expected to be between these two values.

Given this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 1800.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -895.1698071057409
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple nitroalkane, specifically a nitropropane.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of nitro groups (N(=O)=O) generally increases the property value, as seen in molecules like CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O. However, the complexity and size of the molecule also play a significant role.

Given that CCCN(=O)=O is a relatively small molecule with a single nitro group, we can expect its property value to be lower than those of larger, more complex nitro-containing molecules. Comparing it to simpler molecules like CCC, which has a property value of -1327.89211264, and considering the effect of the nitro group, we can estimate a property value that is slightly higher (less negative) than that of CCC.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around -1200.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -69.03823435797513
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, similar to the structure Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, which has a property value of 89.20443821.

The presence of a fluorine atom instead of a chlorine atom might slightly alter the property value due to differences in electronegativity and atomic size. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which could lead to a slightly different electronic environment in the molecule.

Considering these factors and the similarity to the example Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be close to 89.20443821, but slightly adjusted for the presence of fluorine. A predicted value could be around 90.0, accounting for the subtle differences introduced by the fluorine atom.

True Property: -268.5557504778958
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. This molecule is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group, similar to some of the examples given.

Looking at the examples, we can see that the property values are influenced by the size of the molecule, the presence of functional groups, and the overall complexity of the structure. For instance, larger and more complex molecules tend to have higher property values.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is relatively small and less complex compared to some of the larger examples with high property values. It is similar in size and complexity to molecules like CC1CCCO1 (-923.63521645) and CC(C)CO (-904.24796468), which are also small cyclic or bicyclic compounds with alcohol groups.

Based on this comparison, the predicted property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is likely to be in a similar range to these examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately -900.0.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 1126.2012240462616
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)
- A cyclic imide structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O), which is similar to a phthalimide moiety.

Comparing with the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 2035.61335252, we notice that both molecules share the phosphorothioate group and a similar cyclic imide structure. However, the example molecule has an additional thioether linkage (SC(CCl)), which is absent in the target molecule.

Given the structural similarity but the absence of the thioether linkage, we can expect the property value of the target molecule to be somewhat lower than 2035.61335252. The absence of the thioether linkage might reduce the property value, but the core structure remains similar.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be slightly lower than 2035.61335252, possibly around 1900.0.

True Property: 58.19060539073778
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzamide-like structure with a phenyl group attached to a nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of 655.10831605. Both molecules contain aromatic rings and a carbonyl group attached to a nitrogen atom, but the example molecule is more complex with additional aromatic rings and a different heterocyclic structure.

Given the structural similarities and the complexity of the example molecule, we can infer that the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C will be somewhat lower than 655.10831605 due to its simpler structure. However, it will still be positive and relatively high compared to simpler aliphatic compounds.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around 400 to 500. Let's choose a specific value within this range:

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -365.0977249478377
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is an ester, specifically an ethyl ester of heptanoic acid. 

From the examples, we can observe that similar molecules, such as esters and long-chain hydrocarbons, tend to have property values that are negative and relatively close to zero. For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of -95.31103785, which is an ester with a similar structure but with one more carbon in the chain.

Considering the structural similarity and the trend in the examples, the predicted property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would likely be slightly more negative than -95.31103785 due to the slightly shorter carbon chain. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be approximately:

-100.0

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -442.6467320327675
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is methyl benzoate, which is an ester derived from benzoic acid.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Esters like CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 have a property value of -153.89592763.
2. The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, which is ethyl benzoate, has a property value of -307.75338848.

Methyl benzoate is structurally similar to ethyl benzoate, but with a slightly smaller alkyl group (methyl instead of ethyl). This suggests that the property value for methyl benzoate should be slightly less negative than that of ethyl benzoate due to the smaller size and mass of the methyl group compared to the ethyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate) would be slightly less negative than -307.75338848. A predicted value could be around -250.0, considering the trend observed in the examples.

True Property: -1096.8799290807412
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we need to consider the patterns and trends from the given examples. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the overall complexity of the molecule.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, making it a conjugated diene. In the examples, simpler hydrocarbons and those with fewer functional groups tend to have more negative property values. For instance, CC/C=C/C has a property value of -1077.49267731, and C1CCCC1 has the same value of -1077.49267731, indicating that simple hydrocarbons with similar degrees of unsaturation have similar property values.

Given that C=CCC=C is a simple conjugated diene, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be in the same range as other simple hydrocarbons. Therefore, the predicted property value for C=CCC=C is approximately:

-1077.49267731

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some form of energy, stability, or reactivity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is tribromomethane, also known as bromoform. It is a small, symmetrical molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples provided, halogenated compounds tend to have positive property values, and the presence of multiple halogen atoms, especially heavier ones like bromine, seems to increase the property value.

For instance, the molecule Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (bromobenzene) has a property value of 239.36908921, and the molecule Ic1cccc2ccccc12 (iodobenzene) has a property value of 691.35362951. These values suggest that the presence of halogens contributes positively to the property value.

Given that BrC(Br)Br is a simple molecule with three bromine atoms, we can expect its property value to be positive and likely higher than that of bromobenzene due to the additional bromine atoms. However, it may not be as high as iodobenzene due to the absence of an aromatic ring.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around 300 to 400. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S) with ethoxy groups (OCC).
- A thioester linkage (SC).
- A chloro-substituted carbon (CCl).
- An imide group (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O), which is a cyclic structure with a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, have relatively high property values (1785.63705165).
- Molecules with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups, such as OC3N=C(c1ccccc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O, also have high property values (1336.56636913).
- The presence of chlorine atoms in aromatic systems tends to increase the property value, as seen in Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (324.22678247) and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (2049.77874034).

Considering these factors, the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is expected to have a relatively high property value due to the combination of a phosphorothioate group, aromatic rings, and chlorine substitution.

Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 1600.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A tertiary amide group (CN(C)C(=O)N)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1ccc(c(Cl)c1))
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle (n2nc(oc2=O))
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with amide groups, such as CN(C)C(=O)C, have property values around -914.
- Chlorinated aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, have property values around -236.
- Nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2, have property values around 260.
- The presence of tert-butyl groups, as seen in CCC(C)C, has a property value of -1058.

Considering these observations, the molecule in question has a combination of these features, which suggests a complex interaction of these structural elements. The presence of the amide and chlorinated aromatic ring suggests a negative contribution, while the nitrogen-containing heterocycle and tert-butyl group may contribute positively.

Balancing these factors, the predicted property value for CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C is likely to be slightly negative, but not as negative as the simple amide or chlorinated aromatic compounds alone. A reasonable estimate, considering the complexity and the examples, would be around -200.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether. It has two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with three chlorine atoms attached to the rings. 

Looking at the examples, we have:
- Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a property value of -184.40969244.
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 393.54390091.

The target molecule is similar to these examples but has an additional ether linkage and an extra chlorine atom. The ether linkage and additional chlorine atom will likely increase the property value compared to Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, but it might not be as high as Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 due to the lack of a biphenyl structure without an ether linkage.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be somewhere between the values of the two examples, but closer to the higher end due to the additional chlorine and ether linkage.

Therefore, a predicted property value for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl could be approximately 150.

In the examples, there is a similar molecule, CC/C=C/C, which is also a linear alkene with four carbon atoms, specifically 2-butene in a different stereoisomeric form. The property value for CC/C=C/C is given as -1077.49267731.

Since CC/C=C\C is essentially the same molecule as CC/C=C/C, just with a different stereochemistry, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC/C=C\C will be very similar, if not identical, to that of CC/C=C/C.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C is -1077.49267731.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCOCC is a simple linear ether, specifically diethyl ether. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify a few similar structures and their property values:

- CC(C)O (isopropanol) has a property value of -1174.03465178.
- CC(C)Cl (isopropyl chloride) has a property value of -996.64514475.
- CCC(O)CC (pentanol) has a property value of -904.24796468.

These examples suggest that alcohols and ethers tend to have negative property values, likely due to their relatively simple and non-aromatic structures. The property values for these alcohols and ethers are in the range of approximately -900 to -1200.

Given that CCCOCC is a simple ether, we can predict its property value to be in a similar range. Considering its structure and comparing it to the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be around -1100. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOCC is approximately -1100.

This structure is somewhat similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 1117.34425039. Both molecules contain a tertiary amide linkage and two phenyl rings, although the example has an additional heterocyclic component.

Another similar example is Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl, with a property value of 379.55161355. This molecule also contains an amide linkage and a phenyl ring, but it is less complex than the molecule we are predicting.

Considering the structural similarities and the complexity of the molecule, the predicted property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be closer to the higher end of the range provided by the examples with similar structures.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-)
- A bromobenzene ring (c1ccc(Br)cc1)

From the examples:
- Molecules with acetamide groups, such as CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, have a property value of 549.48818401.
- Molecules with bromobenzene rings, such as Fc1cccc(Br)c1, have a property value of -69.03823436, and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of -88.18506882.

Considering the combination of these structural features, the property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to be influenced by both the acetamide group and the bromobenzene ring. The presence of the bromine atom and the aromatic ring suggests a property value closer to those of similar structures with halogens and aromatic rings.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately -100.0.

The presence of the additional methyl group in cumene might slightly increase the property value compared to ethylbenzene.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 (cumene) would be slightly higher than that of ethylbenzene. Therefore, a predicted property value for cumene could be around -580.0.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -731.3975364390304
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to similar molecules in the dataset. 

The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached. In the examples, we have several aromatic compounds with various substituents, and their property values vary significantly based on the nature and number of substituents.

For instance, the molecule NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (salicylamide) has a property value of -433.14543999, and it contains both an amide and a hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring. The molecule COc1ccccc1 (anisole) has a property value of -712.01028467, with a methoxy group attached to a benzene ring.

Considering the structure of benzaldehyde, which is simpler than the above examples with only an aldehyde group attached to the benzene ring, we can expect its property value to be less negative than those with additional functional groups like hydroxyl or methoxy. 

Based on this reasoning and the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 would be around -500.0. This value reflects the influence of the aldehyde group on the benzene ring, without additional electron-donating or withdrawing groups that would significantly alter the property value.

The molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally similar to this example, as both contain two phenyl rings connected by a nitrogen-containing linkage.

Given this similarity, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 will be close to that of N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2. Therefore, the predicted property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is approximately 0.45198454.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a relatively small and compact structure with two amide groups and a cyclohexane ring. In the examples, similar cyclic structures with amide groups, such as C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1, have a property value of 29.31167827.

Considering the structural similarity and the presence of amide groups, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be close to that of the similar cyclic amide structure. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately 30.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can see that the property values are influenced by the presence of chlorine atoms and the overall structure of the molecule. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccccc1Cl has a property value of -338.2671533, and the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a property value of 1657.07149167. The presence of additional chlorine atoms and the biphenyl structure in the latter example significantly increases the property value.

Given that Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a biphenyl with three chlorine atoms, we can expect its property value to be higher than that of Clc1ccccc1Cl but lower than the highly chlorinated and more complex structure of Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 500.0.

The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, ring structures, and overall molecular size.

The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a simple aromatic compound with an ethyl group attached to a benzene ring. This structure is similar to the example Cc1ccccc1N, which has a property value of -721.47310994. The presence of an additional ethyl group in CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 compared to Cc1ccccc1N might slightly alter the property value, but it is likely to remain in a similar range due to the structural similarity.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be approximately -721.47310994, with a slight adjustment to account for the additional ethyl group. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a sulfonamide derivative, which is similar in some respects to nitrobenzene derivatives in the examples.

The example Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -423.64414796. The sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is somewhat similar in electronic and steric effects to the nitro group (N(=O)=O), as both are electron-withdrawing groups attached to an aromatic ring. However, the sulfonamide group is generally less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group.

Given this comparison, the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is likely to be in a similar range but slightly less negative than that of the nitrobenzene derivative. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be around -400.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with multiple aromatic rings and functional groups like hydroxyls and ketones tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5 has a property value of 3320.01878236, and it contains multiple aromatic rings and functional groups.

Given the structure of the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, which has a similar complexity with multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups, we can predict that its property value will be relatively high.

1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains a thiophosphate group (P(=O)(OC)S) and an acetamide group (NC(C)=O). These groups are similar to those found in some of the examples, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl and CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C.

2. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - The example COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of 1340.27841238. This molecule has a thiophosphate group and aromatic chlorinated rings, which contribute significantly to its property value.
   - The example CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C has a property value of 1647.44518263. This molecule also contains a thiophosphate group and additional functional groups that increase its property value.

3. **Structural Complexity**: The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is less complex than the examples mentioned above, as it lacks aromatic rings and additional substituents that would increase the property value.

4. **Prediction**: Given the presence of the thiophosphate group and the acetamide group, but considering the simpler structure compared to the examples, the property value is expected to be lower than those of the more complex molecules.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around 800.0. This value accounts for the presence of the thiophosphate and acetamide groups while acknowledging the simpler overall structure compared to the higher-valued examples.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some form of energy or stability measure.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, relatively simple molecule. In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules tend to have more negative property values, which might suggest lower energy or higher stability.

For instance, the molecule CCC=O (propanal) has a property value of -1193.42190355, and CCBr (bromoethane) has a property value of -704.06689679. These are small molecules with relatively simple structures.

Given the simplicity and size of Cl\C=C/Cl, we can expect its property value to be in a similar range to these smaller molecules. Considering the presence of two chlorine atoms, which might increase the property value slightly compared to a similar hydrocarbon, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around -700 to -800.

True Property: -991.2597970353812
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of aromatic and heteroaromatic compounds, and the property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some form of energy or stability measure.

Pyridine is a simple heteroaromatic compound with a nitrogen atom in a six-membered ring, similar to benzene but with one carbon replaced by nitrogen. In the examples, we have:

- c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23, which is a more complex heteroaromatic system, with a property value of -18.93526723.
- CNc1ccccc1, an aniline derivative, with a property value of -721.47310994.
- Oc1cccc(Cl)c1, a chlorophenol, with a property value of -515.65666033.

Considering pyridine's structure and comparing it to these examples, it is likely to have a property value that is less negative than the aniline derivative but more negative than the complex heteroaromatic system. Pyridine is a relatively stable aromatic compound, but the presence of nitrogen might make it slightly less stable than benzene derivatives.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of pyridine (c1ccncc1) would be around -200.0. This value reflects its stability as a simple heteroaromatic compound, positioned between the more complex heteroaromatic and the simpler benzene derivatives.

1. An ester group (OC(=O)c1ccccc1) which is similar to the ester groups in some of the examples.
2. An aromatic amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23) which is present in some of the examples with positive property values.
3. A chlorinated aromatic ring, which is seen in examples with both positive and negative property values, but often contributes to higher values due to increased molecular weight and potential for interactions.

Considering these features and the trends observed in the examples, the molecule is likely to have a positive property value. The presence of the ester and amide groups, along with the chlorinated aromatic system, suggests a property value in the higher range of the examples provided.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 would be approximately 450.0.

The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol with five carbon atoms and one hydroxyl group. It is similar in structure to other linear alkanes and alcohols in the examples, such as OC1CCCCCCC1 (-518.9551858) and C1CCC2CCCCC2C1 (-422.41321134). These examples suggest that linear or cyclic hydrocarbons with alcohol groups tend to have negative property values.

Given the structure of CCCCCO, which is a relatively simple linear alcohol, I would predict its property value to be in the range of other similar linear alcohols. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be approximately -500.0.

The molecule contains a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), an amide linkage (C(=O)N), and an aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which are common features in some of the examples.

The presence of a sulfonyl group and an aromatic ring suggests a property value that might be similar to other molecules with these features. For instance, the molecule CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C has a property value of 1569.65575824, and it contains a phosphorus-sulfur linkage and an aromatic ring. However, the given molecule lacks the phosphorus component and has a different overall structure.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups, the property value is likely to be positive and moderately high, but not as high as the most complex examples provided.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be approximately 800.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a bicyclic compound with two amide groups and a cyclopropane ring.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) and nitrogen atoms (N) in amide linkages tends to contribute to a more negative property value, as seen in molecules like CCC(C)C(=O)OC2CC(C)C=C3C=CC(C)C(CCC1CC(O)CC(=O)O1)C23 and CCNC(=S)NCC. Additionally, smaller ring systems like cyclopropane can also influence the property value.

Given these considerations, the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is expected to have a property value that is negative, reflecting the influence of the carbonyl and amide groups. However, the exact value would depend on the balance of these structural features.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -500.0. This estimate takes into account the presence of multiple carbonyl groups and the small ring system, which are significant contributors to the property value.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure, consisting of a chloroethane (ethyl chloride) group. In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules tend to have more negative property values. For instance, CCC1CCCCC1 has a property value of -672.81264666, and Clc1ccccc1 has a property value of -669.51412119. These examples suggest that smaller, less complex molecules with halogen atoms tend to have negative property values.

Given the simplicity and small size of ClCC, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Considering the trend in the examples, a plausible prediction for the property value of ClCC would be around -1000.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a pyridine ring and a trichloromethyl group. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms and an aromatic ring suggests that the property value might be influenced by the electron-withdrawing nature of the chlorine atoms and the aromatic system.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 724.7908688. This molecule has a similar structure with multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings.
- Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2, with a property value of 62.29693302, is another chlorinated aromatic compound but with fewer chlorine atoms.

Given the structural similarity to these examples, particularly the first one, and considering the additional electron-withdrawing effect of the trichloromethyl group, the property value for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is likely to be higher than 724.7908688 but not as high as the more heavily chlorinated compounds like Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl, which has a property value of 1088.19605589.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of halogens, particularly bromine, tends to have a significant impact on the property value. For instance, CI (iodobenzene) has a property value of -386.97570004, and ClC(Cl)Cl (trichloromethane) has a property value of -603.93789607. The presence of multiple halogens generally results in a more negative property value.

Given that 1,4-dibromobenzene is similar in structure to these halogenated compounds, we can expect its property value to be negative and likely more negative than that of a single halogenated benzene due to the presence of two bromine atoms.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around -500.0.

The molecule in question is a triaryl phosphate ester, which includes three aromatic rings and a phosphate group. The presence of aromatic rings and a phosphate ester linkage suggests that the property value might be influenced by the aromaticity and the electronegative oxygen atoms in the phosphate group.

Looking at the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and electronegative atoms (such as Cl, O, or N) tend to have positive property values, often in the range of 500 to 1500.

True Property: 1249.5833868562372
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to increase the molecular weight and potentially the property value.
- An aromatic ring, which is common in several examples with varying property values.
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle, which can influence the property value depending on its context.
- Two chlorine atoms, which are electronegative and can affect the property value.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with halogens, especially multiple chlorines, tend to have higher property values (e.g., Clc1ccc(I)cc1 with a property value of 541.18897851).
- The presence of a trifluoromethyl group is similar to the example CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C with a property value of 1232.07139009, indicating a potential increase in the property value.
- The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle is similar to the example NS(=O)(=O)c2cc1c(NCNS1(=O)=O)cc2Cl with a property value of 1111.36266776.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O is likely to be in the higher range due to the presence of multiple electronegative atoms and the trifluoromethyl group. A reasonable estimate would be around 1200 to 1300.

Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately **1250**.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -279.28797913697105
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring, with a nitro group (NO2) also attached to the ring.

From the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Aromatic compounds with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -135.31647801.
- Aromatic compounds with methoxy groups, such as c1ccccc1O, have a property value of -846.90362822.

The molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O combines both a methoxy group and a nitro group on a benzene ring. The presence of the electron-withdrawing nitro group and the electron-donating methoxy group will influence the overall property value.

Considering the examples and the structural features of nitroanisole, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be somewhere between the values for the nitro and methoxy aromatic compounds. Given the examples, a predicted property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O could be approximately -500.0.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them with the examples provided. The molecule is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, which suggests a high molecular weight and significant electron-withdrawing effects due to the chlorine atoms.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, have high positive property values (e.g., 1044.88247356). The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value due to their electronegativity and contribution to the molecular weight.

Considering the structure of the given molecule, which is highly chlorinated and complex, it is reasonable to predict a high positive property value. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl would be approximately 1200.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some form of energy or stability measure.

The molecule CCCOC=O is a simple ester, specifically propyl formate. It consists of a propyl group (CCC) attached to a formate group (OC=O). In the examples, simpler molecules with fewer functional groups and less complexity tend to have more negative property values, indicating lower energy or stability.

For instance:
- CC(O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of -577.11694112.
- CCC#C has a property value of -1231.77327263.
- CCCCCC#C has a property value of -692.19989843.

Given that CCCOC=O is a relatively simple molecule with an ester functional group, we can expect its property value to be negative, similar to other small organic molecules in the examples.

Considering the examples and the structure of CCCOC=O, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be around -800. This is based on the trend observed in the examples, where simpler molecules with fewer functional groups have more negative values. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC=O is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, chain length, and aromaticity.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is a linear aliphatic ester with a long carbon chain. It is similar in structure to other aliphatic compounds in the examples, such as CCCCC(CC)C=O and CCCCCCc1ccccc1, which have property values of -518.9551858 and -191.40102778, respectively. The presence of the ester functional group (C(=O)O) in CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar to the ester in CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C, which has a high property value of 2196.03901425, but this is due to the complexity and size of the latter molecule.

Considering the linear structure and the presence of the ester group, the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is likely to be negative, similar to other linear aliphatic compounds, but not as low as the simplest alkanes or alcohols. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around -400.0.

- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is present in several molecules with varying property values.

Given these structural features, the molecule is likely to have a property value influenced by the presence of the nitro group, which tends to lower the property value, and the chlorine atoms, which can increase it. The amide linkage is common in molecules with both positive and negative property values, so its influence might be neutral.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be around 200.0.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. The molecule appears to be a complex carbohydrate, likely a polysaccharide or a derivative, given the multiple sugar rings and hydroxyl groups.

From the examples, it seems that the property values are influenced by the molecular complexity, presence of functional groups, and overall molecular size. Larger and more complex molecules with multiple rings and functional groups tend to have higher property values.

Given the structure of the molecule in question, which is quite complex with multiple sugar rings and numerous hydroxyl groups, it is reasonable to predict a relatively high property value. However, it is not as high as the most complex examples provided, such as those with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substitutions.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 1500.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -1231.7732726298868
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne, with a terminal triple bond.

Looking at the examples, we can see that linear alkanes and alkenes tend to have negative property values, often in the range of -400 to -900. For example, the linear alkane CCCCCCCCCCCCCC (hexadecane) has a property value of 849.36550146, while the linear alkene CCCCCCCCC=C (1-decene) has a property value of -403.02595956. The presence of a triple bond in CCC#C suggests it might have a property value closer to that of alkenes or slightly more negative due to the increased unsaturation.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around -500. This accounts for the linear structure and the presence of the triple bond, which typically results in a more negative value compared to alkanes. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCC#C is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a pyridine derivative with a hydrazide group attached to the carbonyl.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as pyridine or pyrazole, often results in negative property values. For instance, the molecule Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2 has a property value of -298.59829737, and Nc1cccc2ccccc12 has a property value of -374.9548346. These examples suggest that nitrogen heterocycles contribute to negative property values.

Additionally, the presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) and hydrazide groups (NN) can also influence the property value. The molecule COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1, which contains nitrogen and carbonyl groups, has a property value of 414.64292392, indicating that these groups can contribute positively or negatively depending on the overall structure.

Considering these factors, the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is likely to have a negative property value due to the pyridine ring and the carbonyl group. However, the exact value will depend on the balance of these structural features.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be around -300. This value reflects the influence of the nitrogen heterocycle and the carbonyl group, similar to the examples provided.

Predicting the specific property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples. The examples provided show a range of property values associated with different functional groups and molecular structures.

The molecule in question, CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, contains several functional groups and structural features:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCCC)S)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)

From the examples, molecules with similar complex structures and functional groups, such as phosphorothioates and amides, tend to have higher property values. For instance, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1 has a property value of 914.1531578, and CN(C)C(=O)SCCCCOc1ccccc1 has a property value of 684.59309479.

Considering the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups in the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, it is reasonable to predict a relatively high property value. Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a predicted property value for this molecule could be approximately 950.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -653.4253948908391
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (n-octane), we can look at the trends in the provided examples. The examples show that alkanes (saturated hydrocarbons) tend to have negative property values, and the magnitude of these values seems to increase with the length of the carbon chain.

For instance:
- CCCCCC (hexane) has a property value of -634.46127758.
- CCCCCC1CCCC1 (a cycloalkane with a similar number of carbons) has a property value of -403.02595956.

Given that CCCCCCCC (octane) is a longer chain than hexane, we can expect its property value to be more negative than -634.46127758. However, it should not be as negative as the values for smaller alkanes like CCC(C)CO (-904.24796468) or CC(C)(C)CO (-904.24796468), which are branched and have different structural characteristics.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (octane) would be around -700 to -800, considering the trend of increasing negativity with longer chains.

Let's predict a specific value: -750.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbonyl group (C=O), similar to some of the examples. It also contains a triple bond (C#C), which is a unique feature compared to the examples.

Looking at the examples, molecules with complex polycyclic structures and multiple functional groups tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO has a property value of 2022.27500023, and it has a complex polycyclic structure with multiple functional groups.

Considering the complexity and the presence of functional groups in the given molecule, it is likely to have a relatively high property value. However, the presence of the triple bond might slightly lower the value compared to similar structures without it.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C would be around 1500.

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings. The presence of methoxy groups (OC) and hydroxyl groups (O) suggests some degree of polarity, but the overall structure is quite large and complex.

From the examples, we can observe that larger, more complex molecules with multiple rings and heteroatoms tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule with the highest property value in the examples is:

CC(C)C(Nc1ccc(cc1Cl)C(F)(F)F)C(=O)OC(C#N)c2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2, 3084.46752002

This molecule is also quite complex, with multiple aromatic rings and functional groups.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple rings and functional groups in the target molecule, it is reasonable to predict a relatively high property value. However, without a specific model or further context on what the property represents, this prediction is based on structural complexity and comparison to the provided examples.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a methylphenol, specifically p-cresol, which is a simple aromatic compound with a hydroxyl group and a methyl group attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that simple aromatic compounds with hydroxyl groups, such as phenol derivatives, tend to have negative property values. For instance, Oc1cccc(O)c1 has a property value of -693.04616736, and Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -414.18132269. The presence of additional functional groups, such as nitro groups, tends to increase the property value, but in the case of Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we only have a methyl group, which is less electron-withdrawing than a nitro group.

Considering the structure of Cc1cccc(C)c1O and comparing it to similar structures in the examples, we can predict that the property value will be negative and likely closer to the value of simple phenolic compounds. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be around -300 to -400.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 1056.0378366837056
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular size and complexity.

The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a dichlorinated biphenyl, which is similar in structure to the example Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 1718.53177246. The given molecule has four chlorine atoms and two phenyl rings, similar to the example, but with fewer chlorine atoms.

Considering the pattern in the examples, the property value seems to increase with the number of chlorine atoms and the complexity of the aromatic system. Since the given molecule has four chlorine atoms and two phenyl rings, it is less complex than the example with six chlorine atoms and two phenyl rings.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl would be somewhat lower than 1718.53177246, but still relatively high due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around 1200.0.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -1077.4926773095087
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the degree of unsaturation.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is 2-methyl-2-butene, a small hydrocarbon with a double bond, indicating some degree of unsaturation. In the examples, small hydrocarbons with unsaturation, such as CCCCCCCC=C, have negative property values. The presence of a double bond and the relatively small size of the molecule suggest that the property value will be negative and likely similar to other small hydrocarbons.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around -400, similar to other small unsaturated hydrocarbons in the examples. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC=C(C)C is approximately -400.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -935.1848639609483
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we need to consider the pattern in the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some form of energy or stability measure.

The molecule ClCCl is dichloromethane, a simple chlorinated hydrocarbon. In the examples, simpler molecules with fewer atoms and less complex structures tend to have more negative property values. For instance, ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of -157.18483641, and it is a more complex chlorinated compound than ClCCl.

Given this trend, we can predict that ClCCl, being a simpler molecule, will have a more negative property value than ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around -200.0.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 146.83727544392286
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we can see that the property values are influenced by the presence of chlorine atoms and aromatic rings. For instance, the molecule Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which is 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, has a property value of 146.83727544. The presence of an additional hydroxyl group in Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl (2,4,6-trichlorophenol) may slightly alter the property value due to the hydroxyl group's influence on the electronic structure and potential hydrogen bonding.

Considering these factors, the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is likely to be close to that of 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, but slightly adjusted due to the hydroxyl group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl would be approximately 150.0.

True Property: 3908.0602859864894
Predicted Property:
Predicting the specific property value for the given molecule based on the examples provided is a complex task, as it involves understanding the relationship between molecular structure and the property values, which are not explicitly defined in the examples. However, I can attempt to make an educated guess based on the patterns observed in the examples.

The molecule in question, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, including methoxy groups, carbonyls, and cyclic ethers. The presence of these groups suggests a relatively high level of complexity and potential for a high property value, similar to other complex polycyclic and oxygen-rich structures in the examples.

Based on the examples, complex molecules with multiple rings and oxygen functionalities tend to have higher property values. For instance, molecules like O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 have high property values (e.g., 1906.65350815). Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen atoms in the structure, I would predict a relatively high property value.

Therefore, my educated guess for the property value of the given molecule is approximately 1800.0.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 308.8400747188148
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C).

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with similar functional groups and structural complexity tend to have property values in a certain range. For instance, molecules with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups often have positive property values, while simpler aliphatic compounds tend to have negative values.

The molecule in question has a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen atoms, a sulfur atom, and a tert-butyl group, which adds steric bulk. This combination of features suggests a moderate to high property value, similar to other complex heterocyclic compounds in the examples.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be around 700 to 800. Given the specific examples and their values, a more precise estimate would be approximately 713.1, aligning it with similar complex heterocyclic structures.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -307.7533884836217
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is ethyl benzoate, which is an ester derived from benzoic acid and ethanol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with aromatic rings, such as benzene derivatives, tend to have property values that are less negative or even positive compared to aliphatic compounds.
2. Esters, such as CCOC(=O)OC, have a property value of -499.9910685.
3. The presence of an aromatic ring, as seen in compounds like CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O (-96.1284567) and Cc1cccc2c1Cc3ccccc32 (-18.55059954), tends to increase the property value compared to aliphatic chains.

Considering these observations, the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ester with an aromatic ring. The presence of the aromatic ring should increase the property value compared to a simple aliphatic ester. Therefore, the property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is likely to be less negative than -499.9910685 but not as high as the values for more complex aromatic systems.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -96.1284567, similar to the value for CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, which also contains an aromatic ring and a carbonyl group.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -29.600179043578155
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups and the overall size of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with seven carbon atoms and a bromine atom at the end. This structure is similar to the example Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which has a property value of 239.36908921. However, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is an aromatic compound, which typically has a different property value range compared to aliphatic compounds.

Another relevant example is CI, which has a property value of -386.97570004. This is a simple halogenated compound, and its property value is negative, likely due to its small size and lack of complex structure.

Considering the linear alkyl chain nature of CCCCCCCBr and the presence of a bromine atom, the property value is likely to be influenced by the size of the alkyl chain and the presence of the bromine atom. The property value for CCCCCCCBr should be more negative than Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 due to the lack of aromaticity and more negative than CI due to the larger size of the molecule.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around -500.

SMILES: CO
True Property: -1443.821338877742
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for carbon monoxide (CO) based on the examples provided is challenging without knowing the specific property being measured. However, given the context and the range of values, it seems likely that the property could be related to energy, such as enthalpy of formation or Gibbs free energy.

Carbon monoxide is a small, simple molecule, and based on the examples, smaller and simpler molecules tend to have more negative property values. For instance, simple hydrocarbons like CCC (propane) have a property value of -1327.89211264, and CC#C (propyne) has -1366.66661618. 

Given this trend, and considering that CO is even simpler and smaller, I would predict a property value for CO that is more negative than these hydrocarbons. A reasonable estimate might be around -1100, but without knowing the exact property, this is speculative. 

Therefore, my predicted property value for CO is approximately -1100.
