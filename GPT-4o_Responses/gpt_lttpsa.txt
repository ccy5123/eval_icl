SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it appears that the property value is related to the molecular structure, possibly involving factors such as molecular weight, functional groups, and overall molecular complexity. 

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a linear ester with a long carbon chain. Comparing it to the example CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which has a property value of 0.0, we can see that the only difference is the length of the carbon chain. The example molecule has 12 carbon atoms in the chain, while the molecule in question has 10 carbon atoms.

Given that the property value for the 12-carbon ester is 0.0, and considering the pattern that similar esters with varying chain lengths (e.g., CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC) also have a property value of 0.0, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC will also be 0.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is 0.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly involving factors like molecular weight, functional groups, and overall molecular complexity.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite, which contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have relatively high property values (e.g., 1407.7109425).

This molecule contains several key features:
1. A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring.
2. A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) attached to the aromatic ring.
3. An alkene group (C=C) attached to the nitrogen atom in the side chain.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings tend to have higher property values, often in the range of hundreds to over a thousand. The presence of a trifluoromethyl group can also contribute to a higher property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 950.69857239, which is similar to the example with a nitro group and an aromatic ring (Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O). However, due to the additional complexity of the structure, the value might be slightly higher.

Therefore, a predicted property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O could be approximately 950.69857239.

True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that molecules with similar structures or functional groups tend to have similar property values.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. In the provided examples, esters such as CCC(C)C1(CC=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O and CCC(C)(C)O have property values of 1255.88640652 and -155.67144145, respectively. However, the example CCC(C)(C)O, which is a simple alcohol, has a property value of -155.67144145, and the example CC(C)CCOC=O, which is a similar ester, has a property value of 0.0.

Given the structural similarity of CC(C)OC=O to CC(C)CCOC=O, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC(C)OC=O is also 0.0.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -155.6714414457389
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we need to analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might help us make an informed prediction.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a methylphenol, specifically a cresol. In the examples provided, we see that simple aromatic compounds with hydroxyl groups, such as phenol (c1ccccc1O), have a property value of -155.67144145. Additionally, other simple aromatic compounds with alkyl groups, such as toluene (Cc1ccccc1), also have a property value of -674.49075948.

Given that cresol is a combination of a methyl group and a hydroxyl group on a benzene ring, it is reasonable to assume that its property value might be influenced by both the presence of the hydroxyl group and the methyl group. However, the presence of the hydroxyl group seems to have a more significant impact on the property value, as seen in the case of phenol.

Therefore, based on the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is likely to be similar to that of phenol. Thus, the predicted property value is:

The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 contains a thiophosphate group (P(=S)(OC)O) and a substituted aromatic ring with a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) attached to it. 

From the examples, we notice that molecules with the thiophosphate group, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, have a property value of 35.64799071. These molecules have halogen substitutions on the aromatic ring.

The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has a similar thiophosphate group but with different substitutions on the aromatic ring (thiomethyl and methyl groups instead of halogens). However, the presence of the thiophosphate group suggests that the property value might be in a similar range.

Considering the structural similarities and the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be close to 35.64799071.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a nitroalkane, specifically nitropropane. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values, often around -674.49075948. However, molecules with nitro groups, such as nitrobenzene derivatives, tend to have positive property values, often in the range of hundreds to thousands.

Given that CCCN(=O)=O is a relatively simple nitroalkane, it is likely to have a property value that is positive but not as high as more complex aromatic nitro compounds. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 500.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with similar structural features, such as bicyclic systems and alcohol groups, tend to have property values that are not extremely high or low.
2. The presence of a tertiary alcohol group (C(O)C) in a bicyclic system is somewhat similar to the structure of CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO, which has a property value of 1757.52288011, but this example is much more complex.
3. Simpler bicyclic structures like CC1=C(CCCO1)C(=O)Nc2ccccc2 have a property value of 308.52181888.

Given the simplicity of the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 compared to the more complex examples, and considering the presence of a tertiary alcohol group, a reasonable prediction would be a property value that is moderate and not as high as the more complex structures.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 could be around 308.52181888, similar to the simpler bicyclic structures with functional groups.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC) and a cyclic imide structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O). This structure is similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 757.58391768. The main difference is the presence of a sulfur atom in the example, which is replaced by a nitrogen atom in the target molecule.

Considering the structural similarity and the fact that the sulfur atom is replaced by a nitrogen atom, which might slightly affect the property value, we can predict that the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O will be close to 757.58391768, but slightly lower due to the absence of sulfur.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is approximately 757.58391768.

Looking at the examples, we notice that molecules with aromatic rings and heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and oxygen) tend to have positive property values, often in the hundreds or thousands. For instance, the molecule CN2C(=C(O)c1ccccc1S2(=O)=O)C(=O)Nc3ccccn3 has a property value of 1879.85447413, and it contains aromatic rings and heteroatoms.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C has a similar complexity with aromatic rings and a heterocyclic structure, suggesting a positive property value. However, it is less complex than the example with a value of 1879.85447413, so we can expect a lower value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around 500.0.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)
- A thioester linkage (SC(CCl))
- A cyclic imide structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O)

From the examples, we notice that molecules with complex structures, especially those containing heteroatoms like nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus, tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule "COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1" has a property value of 319.80607493, and it contains a phosphorothioate group similar to the one in the molecule we are analyzing.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A tertiary amide group (CN(C)C(=O)N).
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1ccc(c(Cl)c1)).
- A heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen (n2nc(oc2=O)).
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C).

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have high positive property values.
- Molecules with multiple halogens, especially chlorines, often have negative property values.
- Molecules with aromatic rings and heterocycles can have varying property values depending on the presence of other functional groups.

The molecule in question has a combination of a tertiary amide, a chlorinated aromatic ring, and a heterocyclic ring with an oxygen and nitrogen, along with a tert-butyl group. This combination of functional groups is somewhat similar to the example molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of 431.87925436, due to the presence of a nitro group and chlorinated aromatic ring.

However, the molecule in question does not have a nitro group, which significantly contributes to high positive values. Instead, it has a tertiary amide and a heterocyclic ring, which might lower the property value compared to nitro-containing compounds.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C is likely to be positive but not as high as those with nitro groups. A reasonable estimate, considering the presence of the chlorinated aromatic ring and the heterocyclic structure, would be around 308.52181888, similar to the example with a tertiary amide and aromatic structure.

Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately 308.52181888.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group and an oxazole ring. The presence of these functional groups suggests that the property value might be influenced by the electronic effects and the overall molecular structure.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings and nitro groups tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 has a property value of 668.59217109, which is relatively high due to the presence of nitro groups and aromatic rings.

Considering the structure of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, it has a similar complexity and functional group presence as some of the higher-valued examples. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be relatively high.

The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is similar in that it is a cyclic structure with two amide groups. Given the pattern observed in the examples, we can infer that the property value for this molecule should be relatively high, similar to other cyclic amide-containing structures.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 would be around 1200.0.

Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are associated with the molecular structure, particularly focusing on the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular framework. The molecule in question, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is a chlorinated biphenyl, specifically 2,2',4-trichlorobiphenyl.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically a diethylbenzene.

Looking at the examples, we notice that simple hydrocarbons and alkyl-substituted benzenes tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) has a property value of -7.18089021, and Cc1ccccn1 (pyridine) has a property value of -343.91334922. The molecule CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 (a long-chain alkyl benzene) has a property value of -674.49075948.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a relatively simple hydrocarbon with two ethyl groups attached to a benzene ring, it is likely to have a negative property value, similar to other hydrocarbons and alkyl benzenes in the examples.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be around -343.91334922, similar to other simple aromatic hydrocarbons. However, since it is slightly more complex than pyridine but less so than long-chain alkyl benzenes, a more precise estimate might be slightly less negative, around -200 to -300.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 could be approximately -250.

Given the structural similarity and the presence of a benzene ring with a nitrogen-containing functional group, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O will be in a similar range to the nitrobenzene derivatives. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is approximately 1099.18912362.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), an amide linkage (C(=O)N), and an aromatic ring (c2ccccc2). These features are similar to some of the molecules in the examples, particularly those with sulfonyl and amide groups.

One example with a sulfonyl group is CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of 1142.01800454. Another example with an amide linkage is CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1, which has a property value of 71.80890215.

Considering the presence of both sulfonyl and amide groups, along with an aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be influenced by these functional groups. The presence of the sulfonyl group, which is a strong electron-withdrawing group, and the amide linkage, which can contribute to resonance stabilization, suggests a property value that is positive and possibly in the range of the examples with similar functional groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be around 800.0.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:
- An ester group (COC(=O))
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring
- A heterocyclic ring with nitrogen (NC)
- Multiple aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings tend to have higher property values. For instance:
- CCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a property value of 1621.34242639.
- CC2Cc1ccccc1N2NC(=O)c3ccc(Cl)c(c3)S(N)(=O)=O has a property value of 1697.76761511.

The presence of ester groups and aromatic rings also contributes to higher property values, as seen in:
- CNC(=O)Oc1cccc(N=CN(C)C)c1 with a property value of 708.599988.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values, the molecule COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C is likely to have a relatively high property value due to the combination of ester, nitro, and aromatic groups.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with similar cyclic structures and containing carbonyl groups (C=O) often have property values that are not extremely high or low. For instance, the molecule ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of 947.36458765, which is relatively high due to the presence of multiple carbonyl groups and aromatic rings.

However, the molecule in question, O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, lacks the extensive aromatic systems and halogen substitutions that contribute to higher property values in some examples. It is more similar to smaller, less complex structures.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be closer to the lower end of the spectrum, but not as low as the simplest aliphatic alcohols or hydrocarbons. A value around 0.0 could be a reasonable estimate, as it aligns with other small, non-aromatic, and non-halogenated structures in the examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately 0.0.

4. **Amide Linkage**: The molecule has an amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is also present in some of the examples.

By comparing with the examples:
- The molecule Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has a property value of 431.87925436.
- The molecule NC(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of 430.59695253.

Both of these examples have structural similarities with the molecule in question, particularly the presence of a nitro group and an amide linkage. Given these similarities, the property value for Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O is likely to be in a similar range.

True Property: 745.786740896555
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are similar to the phosphorothioate group in the example molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 319.80607493. Additionally, the molecule has aromatic rings with sulfur linkages, similar to the example Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, which has a property value of 1535.68466454.

Considering the presence of multiple phosphorothioate groups and aromatic rings, the property value is likely to be influenced by these features. The presence of two phosphorothioate groups suggests a higher property value compared to the example with one such group.

Based on these observations and the trend in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 would be around 1619.03428311, which is similar to the example with a complex sulfur and aromatic structure.

True Property: 950.6985723877332
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a nitrophenol, which is similar to some of the examples provided.

Looking at the examples, we have:
- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which is a nitrotoluene, with a property value of 431.87925436.
- Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2, which is a dinitrophenyl ether, with a property value of 668.59217109.

The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is a simple nitrophenol, which is structurally similar to nitrotoluene but with a hydroxyl group instead of a methyl group. The presence of the nitro group and the hydroxyl group suggests that the property value might be closer to that of nitrotoluene, but slightly different due to the hydroxyl group.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be around 431.87925436, similar to the nitrotoluene example, but potentially slightly adjusted due to the presence of the hydroxyl group. However, without more specific data or a clear pattern, a precise adjustment is challenging. Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately:

This molecule is a complex sugar, likely a polysaccharide or a derivative, given the multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic acetal structures. In the examples provided, the molecules with high property values tend to be larger, more complex structures, often with multiple rings and functional groups.

The highest property values in the examples are associated with complex organic molecules, often with multiple functional groups and rings, such as:

- NC(N)=NC#N, 1587.23319787

True Property: -674.4907594765953
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we need to analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that might help us make an educated guess.

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne. In the examples provided, we see a variety of molecules with different functional groups and structural complexities. The property values seem to be influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, molecular size, and possibly the degree of unsaturation or aromaticity.

For simpler aliphatic molecules, such as alkanes and small ketones, the property values tend to be negative. For example, CCC(=O)C (a ketone) has a property value of -236.71291673, and CCCCCCCCCC=O (a long-chain aldehyde) has a property value of -236.71291673 as well. The presence of a triple bond in CCC#C might influence the property value, but given the trend for small aliphatic molecules, it is likely to remain negative.

Considering the simplicity and small size of CCC#C compared to the other molecules, and the trend for small aliphatic molecules, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be in the negative range, similar to other small aliphatic compounds.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCC#C could be approximately -236.71291673, aligning it with other small aliphatic compounds in the dataset.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to analyze the given examples and identify any patterns or trends that might help us make an informed prediction.

The examples provided show a range of property values, some of which are negative and some positive. The negative values often correspond to simpler or more symmetrical molecules, while the positive values are associated with more complex or functionalized molecules.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 contains a pyridine ring (c1nccc1) with a carbonyl group (C=O) and a hydrazine moiety (NN) attached. This structure suggests a level of complexity and functionalization that might result in a positive property value, similar to other functionalized aromatic compounds in the examples.

Considering the examples with similar functional groups and complexity, such as those with amide or hydrazine functionalities, the property values tend to be positive and can vary significantly based on the specific structure and substituents.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be a positive value, likely in the lower to mid-hundreds range. A specific prediction could be around 200, considering the presence of the carbonyl and hydrazine groups, which add to the complexity and potential interactions of the molecule.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)

The molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C has a similar polycyclic structure with a hydroxyl group, like the first example, but also includes an alkyne group, which is not present in the examples. The presence of the alkyne group might slightly increase the property value compared to the first example.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is likely to be slightly higher than 282.1064013 but significantly lower than 1757.52288011. A reasonable estimate would be around 350.0.

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings. The examples provided show a range of property values, with some patterns based on structural features such as aromaticity, halogenation, and functional groups.

The molecule in question has several features that could influence its property value:
- Multiple aromatic rings, which in some examples are associated with negative property values.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that certain structural features or functional groups are associated with specific property values.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which contains a phenol group (similar to Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O with a property value of 950.69857239) and a chlorine substituent on the benzene ring. However, the presence of chlorine in other examples, such as Clc1ccccc1I and Clc1cccc2ccccc12, is associated with a property value of -674.49075948.

Given the presence of both a phenol group and a chlorine substituent, the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl might be expected to have a property value influenced by both features. However, the examples with chlorine substituents consistently show a property value of -674.49075948, which suggests that the chlorine's influence might dominate.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is -674.49075948.

- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C)
- An ester linkage (OC(=O))
- An amide linkage (NC(=O))
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substitutions often have a property value of -674.49075948.

The molecule in question has both an ester and an amide group, which are polar and can increase the property value compared to simple aromatic or halogenated compounds. However, it does not have the extensive functionalization or complexity seen in molecules with very high property values.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is higher than -674.49075948 but not as high as those with multiple polar or complex functional groups.

Based on the examples and the structure of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around 308.52181888, similar to other molecules with amide and aromatic structures.

True Property: 1218.1867328949913
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C).

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with similar functional groups and structural complexity tend to have property values in a certain range. For instance, the molecule CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a property value of 1109.44753821, and it contains a similar thiosemicarbazide moiety and a tert-butyl group.

Given the structural similarities and the complexity of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be around 1100. However, considering the specific differences in the molecular structure, a more precise prediction would be slightly lower than 1109.44753821.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we need to analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities. The molecule in question is ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ester group (CCOC(=O)) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1).

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with ester groups and aromatic rings tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 has a property value of 2602.81624256, and the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O has a property value of 757.58391768. These examples suggest that the presence of an ester group and an aromatic ring contributes to a positive property value.

Considering the structure of ethyl benzoate and the patterns observed in the examples, we can predict that the property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 will be positive. However, without additional specific examples that closely match ethyl benzoate, it is challenging to provide an exact numerical prediction. Based on the trend, a reasonable estimate for the property value could be around 200 to 800, given the presence of the ester group and the aromatic ring.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 could be approximately 500.
