SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 3.3001000000000023
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The molecule is a linear ester with a long carbon chain, similar to the example CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which has a property value of 4.0803. The given molecule has one less carbon in the chain, which suggests a slightly lower property value due to the reduced hydrophobic character and molecular size.

Considering the trend that longer carbon chains tend to increase the property value, I would predict the property value for CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC to be slightly less than 4.0803. A reasonable estimate would be around 3.8.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 1.7744999999999997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxygen and a nitrogen atom in a five-membered ring, which is similar to some of the structures in the examples.

The presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in several examples. The heterocyclic structure with an oxygen and nitrogen atom is somewhat similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)C(=O)N1, which has a property value of -1.6476, but the aromatic nature and the presence of chlorine in the target molecule will likely increase the property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is likely to be around 1.5.
==================================================
Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.6715
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite, which contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O).

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of nitro groups generally leads to lower property values, often negative, as seen in examples like Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F (-0.5088) and Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO (0.09202). The isopropyl group, on the other hand, is a small alkyl group that might slightly increase the property value, but not significantly.

Considering these factors, the presence of the nitro group is likely to have a more dominant effect, leading to a lower property value. Therefore, I would predict the property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O to be slightly positive, but close to zero, similar to the example with a nitro group.

Predicted property value: 0.1

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple rings and carbonyl groups. It resembles a steroid-like structure, which is similar to some of the larger, more complex molecules in the examples.

From the examples, we can observe that larger, more complex polycyclic structures with multiple rings and carbonyl groups tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C has a property value of 4.7235, which is relatively high due to its complex structure and multiple rings.

Given the structural complexity and the presence of multiple rings and carbonyl groups in the molecule CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, it is reasonable to predict a property value in a similar range to the complex polycyclic examples.

- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N) connecting to another benzene ring with a chlorine atom (similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 2.9934).

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like fluorine and chlorine, along with the amide linkage, suggests that the property value might be influenced by these features. The examples with similar functional groups and aromatic systems have property values in the range of 2.7 to 3.5.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be around 3.1.

- CCCC(C)(O)CC, which has a property value of 1.9475.
- CCC(C)CO, which has a property value of 1.4149.

Given that CCCOC(C)C is an ether with a similar structure to these examples, we can estimate its property value to be in a similar range. Considering the branching and the presence of the ether group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C would be around 1.4 to 1.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is approximately 1.45.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 3.353600000000002
Predicted Property:
The molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 represents biphenyl, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. Based on the examples provided, the property values seem to be related to the hydrophobicity or lipophilicity of the molecules, often represented by the logarithm of the partition coefficient (log P).

Biphenyl is a relatively non-polar, hydrophobic molecule due to its aromatic rings, similar to other aromatic compounds in the examples. Comparing it to similar structures, such as the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other aromatic compounds in the list, we can estimate its property value.

Given the examples, biphenyl is likely to have a property value slightly lower than the larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but higher than simpler aromatic compounds like benzene derivatives. A reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl would be around 3.9.
==================================================
Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 1.7163
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCCCS is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a sulfur atom at the end. This structure is similar to alkanes, which are generally characterized by their hydrophobic nature and relatively low polarity.

Looking at the examples, we can find similar linear or slightly branched alkanes and their property values:

- CCCCCCC=C (3.5329)
- CCCCCC(C)C (3.2227)
- CCC1CCCCC1 (2.9767)
- CCCCC(=C)C (2.3626)

These examples suggest that linear alkanes with a similar number of carbon atoms have property values in the range of approximately 2.3 to 3.5. The presence of sulfur, which is more polarizable than carbon, might slightly increase the property value compared to a purely hydrocarbon chain.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be around 2.8.

Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1.8050000000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples. The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with a tertiary carbon attached to an alcohol group. 

Looking at the examples, we have:
- CCC(C)(C)C with a property value of 2.4425
- CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O with a property value of 2.4395
- CCCC(C)(O)CC with a property value of 1.9475

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is similar to these examples, particularly CCC(C)(C)C and CCCC(C)(O)CC, as it has a similar branched structure and an alcohol group. The presence of the alcohol group generally decreases the property value compared to a hydrocarbon of similar size due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO would likely be slightly lower than that of CCC(C)(C)C and closer to CCCC(C)(O)CC. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO is approximately 2.0.

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 3.148220000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the examples provided. This molecule is known as 1-methyl-9H-fluorene, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a methyl group attached.

From the examples, we have:

- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 with a property value of 4.30142
- Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 with a property value of 3.45664

Both of these molecules are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with methyl groups, similar to the target molecule. The structure Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is a simpler version of these examples, lacking additional substituents or rings.

Given the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is likely to be slightly lower than 3.45664, as it is less complex than Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately 3.2.

SMILES: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C
True Property: 1.3510999999999993
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the examples provided.

The given molecule is a cyclic compound with a diketopiperazine core (a six-membered ring with two amide groups) and additional alkyl and alkenyl substituents. In the examples, a similar compound, O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, has a property value of -0.0652. The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the given molecule.

The addition of an alkyl chain generally increases the hydrophobicity and molecular size, which can affect the property value. However, since the base structure is quite similar, the change might not be drastic.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is likely to be slightly higher than -0.0652 due to the increased hydrophobicity from the additional alkyl chain. A reasonable estimate would be around 0.1.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 2.705400000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have higher property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of 2.9446, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 7.274. The presence of multiple halogens, especially fluorine, which is highly electronegative, can significantly influence the property value.

Considering the examples and the structure of trifluoromethylbenzene, we can predict that the property value will be relatively high due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the trifluoromethyl group, which increases the overall hydrophobicity and possibly the molecular weight contribution.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around 3.0.

Predicted Property:
The molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a sugar, specifically a form of glucose. Sugars typically have multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups, which contribute to their high polarity and ability to form hydrogen bonds. This generally results in a low or negative property value similar to the examples provided, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, which has a property value of -3.5854.

Given the structural similarity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O would likely be in the same range. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately -3.5.

This molecule is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. It resembles some of the more complex cyclic structures in the examples, such as:

- CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of 4.8401.
- CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C, which has a property value of 4.2693.

The presence of multiple rings and carbonyl groups suggests a relatively high property value, similar to the examples above. Given the structural complexity and the presence of similar functional groups, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be in the range of these examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C is approximately 4.5.

This molecule is a polycyclic compound with multiple cyclohexane rings and a hydroxyl group, similar to some of the examples given.

The molecule resembles a steroid-like structure, which typically has a moderate to high property value due to its hydrophobic nature and multiple ring systems. In the examples, similar complex polycyclic structures with hydroxyl groups, such as CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O, have a property value of 3.6092.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of a hydroxyl group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O would be around 3.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an acetanilide derivative with a nitro group attached to the aromatic ring. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to increase the property value, as seen in molecules like O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (1.5948) and COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (1.6034).
- The presence of an amide group (C(=O)N) is also present in some examples, such as CNC(=O)C=C(C)OP(=O)(OC)OC (1.0537) and CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1 (2.3705), which suggests a moderate influence on the property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has both a nitro group and an amide group, which suggests a property value in the range of 1.5 to 2.0. Given the influence of the nitro group and the aromatic ring, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 1.7. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is approximately 1.7.

True Property: 4.236100000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Molecular Complexity**: The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), an ester linkage (OCC), a thioether linkage (SC), and a chlorinated aromatic ring. These features suggest a moderate level of complexity.

2. **Functional Groups**: The presence of a phosphorothioate group and a chlorinated aromatic ring can increase the property value, as seen in molecules with halogens and complex functional groups.

3. **Aromaticity and Halogens**: The presence of an aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent is similar to other molecules in the examples that have higher property values, such as Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (3.4932) and Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl (4.6604).

4. **Comparison with Examples**: The molecule has some similarity to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (2.9934) in terms of having a chlorinated aromatic ring, but it also has additional complexity due to the phosphorothioate and ester groups.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 is likely to be in the range of 3.0 to 4.0. Given the additional complexity compared to simpler chlorinated aromatics, a reasonable estimate would be:

SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 1.0248
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples. The molecule CC(C)(C)CO is tert-butanol, which is a tertiary alcohol with a branched structure.

From the examples, we have:
- CC(C)CO (isobutanol) with a property value of 0.6347.
- CCC (propane) with a property value of 1.4163.
- CCCCCCC(C)O (2-octanol) with a property value of 2.7277.
- CCCCC(CC)CO (2-nonanol) with a property value of 2.1951.
- CCCCO (butanol) with a property value of 1.9475.

Tert-butanol is more branched than isobutanol, which typically results in a lower property value due to decreased surface area and different intermolecular interactions. Given that isobutanol has a property value of 0.6347, we can expect tert-butanol to have a slightly lower value due to its increased branching.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO (tert-butanol) would be around 0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a bicyclic compound with two nitrogen-containing rings, specifically a purine-like structure.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with nitrogen-containing heterocycles, such as Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F (-0.5088) and Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1 (-0.6479), tend to have negative property values. These examples suggest that the presence of nitrogen atoms in a heterocyclic structure contributes to a lower property value, likely due to increased polarity or hydrogen bonding potential.

Given the structural similarity of O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 to these examples, particularly the presence of multiple nitrogen atoms and the potential for hydrogen bonding, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Considering the examples provided, a value slightly more negative than -0.5088 but close to -0.6479 seems appropriate.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is approximately -0.6.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl acetate, which is an ester. 

Looking at the examples, we can see that esters generally have property values around 1.5 to 2.0. For instance, the molecule CCOP(=O)(OCC)OCC, which is a similar ester, has a property value of 2.204. Another example is CCCOC(C)C, which is an ether with a property value of 1.8214.

Considering the structure of isopropyl acetate, which is relatively small and has a similar functional group to the examples, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be around 1.8.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O is approximately 1.8.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a symmetrical urea derivative with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. 

Looking at the examples, we can see that aromatic rings, such as phenyl groups, tend to increase the property value. For instance, the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1 has a property value of 1.9648, and Clc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 4.9536. The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro or halogens tends to increase the property value further.

The molecule in question, O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, does not have any additional electron-withdrawing or donating groups beyond the phenyl rings. It is similar to the molecule NC(=O)c1cccnc1, which has a property value of 0.1805, but with an additional phenyl group.

Considering the influence of the two phenyl groups and the urea linkage, the property value is likely to be higher than that of NC(=O)c1cccnc1 but lower than those with additional electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 would be around 1.5.

Predicted Property:
The molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon known as triphenylene. Based on the examples provided, the property values seem to be related to the hydrophobicity or logP (partition coefficient) of the molecules, which is influenced by the size, aromaticity, and presence of polar or non-polar groups.

Triphenylene is a large, fully aromatic hydrocarbon with no polar functional groups, similar to the example c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1, which has a property value of 5.1462. Given that triphenylene is also a large, planar aromatic system, it is expected to have a similar or slightly higher property value due to its extended conjugated system.

Therefore, the predicted property value for C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (triphenylene) is approximately 5.2.

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -0.5594299999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule contains a sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N), an aromatic ring with an amine substituent, and a guanidine group (NC(=N)N).

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro or sulfonyl) tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms, especially in functional groups like guanidine, can influence the property value, often lowering it due to increased polarity or hydrogen bonding potential.

Considering these factors, the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 has features that could lead to a moderate property value. The sulfonamide and guanidine groups may lower the property value compared to simple aromatic compounds, but the presence of the aromatic ring and the amine group could balance this effect.

Based on these considerations and the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 would be around 1.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which tends to lower the property value, as seen in examples like Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (1.3004).
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) attached to the aromatic ring, which can increase the property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature, similar to halogens.
- An alkylamine group (CCN(CC(C)=C)), which can increase the property value, as seen in examples like CCN(CC)c1ccccc1 (2.5328).

Considering these features, the molecule has both electron-withdrawing groups (nitro and trifluoromethyl) and an alkylamine group, which can have opposing effects on the property value. The presence of two nitro groups suggests a significant electron-withdrawing effect, which might lower the property value compared to molecules with only one nitro group.

Based on the balance of these structural features and comparing with the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 2.0.

- CCC(C)(C)O (1.1673): This is a tertiary alcohol with a similar carbon backbone.

Considering the structural similarities and the functional group, the property value for CC(C)OC=O is likely to be close to these examples. Given that CC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of 1.2055 and CCC(C)(C)O has a value of 1.1673, the property value for CC(C)OC=O should be slightly lower than 1.2055 due to its smaller size and similar to 1.1673.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O is approximately 1.1.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: 2.0090399999999997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a simple aromatic compound with a hydroxyl group and two methyl groups attached to the benzene ring. The presence of the hydroxyl group suggests some degree of polarity, while the methyl groups contribute to hydrophobicity.

Looking at the examples, the molecule c1ccccc1O (phenol) has a property value of 1.3922. The addition of methyl groups generally increases the hydrophobicity and can increase the property value slightly. For instance, the molecule Cc1cccc(N)c1 (aniline with a methyl group) has a property value of 1.57722.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would likely be slightly higher than that of phenol due to the additional methyl groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is approximately 1.6.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 3.6130200000000023
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)O), which is similar to the phosphorothioate groups in the examples COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl (4.652), COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl (4.4941), and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (4.5429). These examples have relatively high property values, likely due to the presence of halogens which increase the property value.

In the target molecule, instead of halogens, there is a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) attached to the aromatic ring. The presence of a thiomethyl group can increase the property value, but likely not as much as halogens do. The methyl group is a common substituent that can slightly increase the property value.

Considering these factors, the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is expected to be lower than those of the halogenated examples but still relatively high due to the phosphorothioate group. A reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 4.0.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 6.620600000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with multiple chlorine atoms attached to two fused benzene rings, similar to some of the examples given.

From the examples, we can observe that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 7.274, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 7.9274. These examples suggest that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms significantly increases the property value.

Given the structure of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, which is a highly chlorinated biphenyl, we can predict that its property value will be relatively high, similar to the other highly chlorinated compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 7.0.

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.6731
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group attached to the terminal carbon. 

Looking at the examples, we can see that the presence of nitro groups generally increases the property value, as seen in molecules like CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, which has a high property value of 4.1482. However, the complexity and size of the molecule also play a significant role. 

In this case, CCCN(=O)=O is a relatively small and simple molecule compared to the larger aromatic and polycyclic structures with higher property values. The closest comparison might be to smaller aliphatic molecules with functional groups, such as CCC, which has a property value of 1.4163.

Considering these factors, the presence of the nitro group will increase the property value compared to a simple alkane like CCC, but not to the extent seen in larger, more complex molecules. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be slightly higher than that of CCC, but not excessively so.

A predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O could be approximately 1.8.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: 2.5882000000000005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule consists of a benzene ring with a fluorine (F) and a bromine (Br) substituent. 

Looking at the examples, we have:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 with a property value of 3.1025, which is a benzene ring with chlorine and bromine substituents.
- c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12 with a property value of 3.6023, which is a naphthalene structure with a bromine substituent.

The presence of halogens like chlorine and bromine tends to increase the property value. Fluorine is less bulky and less polarizable than chlorine, but it is highly electronegative, which can also influence the property value.

Considering these factors, the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is likely to be slightly lower than Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 due to the substitution of chlorine with fluorine. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be around 3.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. This molecule is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group, which is somewhat similar to some of the examples given.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic structure with a tertiary alcohol group. In the examples, molecules with similar complexity and functional groups, such as CC1CCCO1 (1.1853) and CC(C)(C)CO (1.0248), have property values around 1.0 to 1.2. The presence of the tertiary alcohol group and the bicyclic structure might increase the property value slightly compared to simpler cyclic alcohols.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 would be around 1.2.

True Property: 2.5801000000000007
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC) and a cyclic amide (lactam) structure with a benzene ring, similar to the structure of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 3.8782.

The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of a sulfur atom in the side chain of the example molecule, which is not present in the molecule we are predicting. This could slightly affect the property value, but the overall structure and functional groups are quite similar.

Considering these similarities, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is likely to be close to 3.8782. Given the absence of the sulfur atom in the side chain, a slightly lower value might be expected. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 3.7.

To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we can analyze its structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzoyl group attached to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, specifically a methylated benzotriazole. This structure is somewhat similar to other aromatic and heterocyclic compounds in the examples, such as Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O (3.00254) and CNc1ccccc1 (1.7283).

Considering the aromatic nature and the presence of nitrogen in the heterocycle, the property value is likely to be influenced by these features. The presence of the carbonyl group and the methyl groups also contribute to the overall property.

Based on the examples and the structural features, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around 2.5.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 2.1298000000000004
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which consists of a heptanoic acid moiety (CCCCCCC(=O)O) and an ethyl group (CC).

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Linear alkanes like CCCCC (pentane) have a property value of 2.1965.
- Esters such as CCOC(=O)N have a property value of 0.1016, and CC(C)OC(=O)C has a property value of 0.9579.
- Longer chain esters like CCCCCCCC(=O)OC have a property value of 2.91.

Considering the structure of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, it is similar to the longer chain ester example, CCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which has a property value of 2.91. The additional carbon in the chain of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC compared to CCCCCCCC(=O)OC might slightly increase the property value due to increased hydrophobicity and molecular size.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be slightly higher than 2.91, but not significantly so. A predicted value could be around 3.0.
==================================================
Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 1.4732
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is methyl benzoate, which consists of a benzene ring with a methoxycarbonyl group attached.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 with a property value of 1.5689
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 with a property value of 1.8633

The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, but without the ethyl group. The removal of the ethyl group would likely decrease the property value slightly due to the reduction in hydrophobic character and molecular size.

Given this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be slightly less than 1.8633. Therefore, a predicted property value could be approximately 1.7.
==================================================
Iteration: 37
SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: 1.7485
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear chain with two double bonds, making it a conjugated diene. 

Looking at the examples, we have:
- CC/C=C/C with a property value of 1.9725, which is a linear alkene with one double bond.
- C=Cc1ccccc1 with a property value of 2.3296, which is a styrene-like structure with a double bond conjugated to an aromatic ring.

The molecule C=CCC=C is similar to these in that it is a small hydrocarbon with conjugated double bonds, but it lacks the aromatic component of C=Cc1ccccc1. Given that conjugation generally increases the property value compared to a single double bond, we can expect the property value of C=CCC=C to be slightly higher than that of CC/C=C/C but lower than C=Cc1ccccc1.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C would be around 2.1.

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 2.4547
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a physicochemical property such as hydrophobicity, solubility, or a similar characteristic.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is tribromomethane, also known as bromoform. It is a small, highly halogenated compound. In the examples, highly halogenated aromatic compounds like Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl have high property values (6.6206), while simpler halogenated compounds like FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br have moderate values (2.5085).

Given that BrC(Br)Br is a small, non-aromatic, highly halogenated compound, we can expect its property value to be relatively high, but not as high as the large aromatic halogenated compounds. It should be higher than simpler non-aromatic compounds with fewer halogens.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around 3.5 to 4.0. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 4.3319.
- An amide linkage (N-C=O) within a cyclic structure, similar to the example CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O with a property value of 2.64.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is a feature in several examples with varying contributions to the property value.

Considering these features and their contributions in the examples, the molecule is likely to have a property value influenced by the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the cyclic amide structure. The presence of the chlorinated carbon may slightly increase the property value.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 3.8.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we can analyze its structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Functional Groups and Structural Features:**
   - The molecule contains an amide group (N(C)C(=O)N), which is present in several examples with varying property values.
   - It has a chloro-substituted aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 (4.6604) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (4.3002).
   - The molecule also contains a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen atoms, which can influence the property value.
   - The presence of a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C) can increase the hydrophobicity, similar to other alkyl groups in the examples.

2. **Comparison with Examples:**
   - The presence of a chloro-substituted aromatic ring suggests a higher property value, as seen in examples with multiple chloro groups.
   - The amide group is present in examples with lower property values, such as CN(C)C(=O)C (0.0945) and CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C (0.2296).
   - The heterocyclic structure with nitrogen and oxygen might contribute to a moderate property value, as seen in other heterocyclic examples.

3. **Prediction:**
   - Considering the combination of a chloro-substituted aromatic ring, an amide group, and a heterocyclic structure, the property value is likely to be moderate.
   - The tert-butyl group may slightly increase the property value compared to similar structures without it.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be around 2.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples. This molecule is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which is similar to other chlorinated aromatic compounds in the list.

From the examples, we have:
- Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl with a property value of 2.699
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 with a property value of 4.6604
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl with a property value of 4.0058

The target molecule has two chlorinated phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, which is somewhat similar to the structure of Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2, but with an ether linkage instead of a direct bond between the rings. The presence of the ether linkage might slightly reduce the property value compared to a direct biphenyl linkage.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be around 3.5.
==================================================
Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: 1.9725
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC/C=C\C, we can look at the examples provided and identify the most similar structure. The molecule CC/C=C\C is a linear alkene with four carbon atoms, also known as 2-butene. 

In the examples, the molecule CC/C=C/C, which is also 2-butene but with a different stereochemistry (trans-2-butene), has a property value of 1.9725. Since the stereochemistry (cis vs. trans) can affect the property value, but the core structure is the same, we can reasonably predict that the property value for CC/C=C\C (cis-2-butene) will be very close to that of trans-2-butene.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C is approximately 1.9725.

Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 1.4329
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCOCC is a linear chain with an ether functional group (R-O-R') and a total of 5 carbon atoms.

Looking at the examples, we can find similar structures:

1. CCC(O)CC has a property value of 1.1673. This molecule is similar in size and has an alcohol group, which is somewhat comparable to an ether in terms of polarity and molecular interactions.

2. C1CCCCCC1 (cyclohexane) has a property value of 2.7307. This molecule is a saturated hydrocarbon with 6 carbon atoms, which is slightly larger than CCCOCC.

3. CCCCNC(=O)n1c(NC(=O)OC)nc2ccccc12 has a property value of 2.5724. This molecule is more complex and has additional functional groups, making it less directly comparable.

Considering the linear structure and the presence of an ether group, CCCOCC is likely to have a property value between those of simple hydrocarbons and alcohols. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be around 1.2 to 1.5.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCOCC could be approximately 1.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a tertiary amide with two phenyl rings and a tert-butyl group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 3.3381. Both molecules contain a tertiary amide and two phenyl rings, although the example has an additional heterocyclic component.

The presence of the tert-butyl group in the molecule of interest may increase the property value slightly due to its hydrophobic nature, but the overall structure is still dominated by the aromatic rings and the amide linkage.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be slightly higher than 3.3381, but not significantly so. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 3.4.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an acetanilide derivative with a bromine substituent on the phenyl ring.

1. **Structural Analysis**: 
   - The molecule has an acetamide group (CC(=O)N-) attached to a brominated phenyl ring (c1ccc(Br)cc1).
   - The presence of a bromine atom on the aromatic ring generally increases the property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature and increased molecular weight.

2. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 has a property value of 2.5882. This molecule is similar in that it has a halogenated phenyl ring, but it also has a fluorine atom, which is more electronegative than the acetamide group.
   - The molecule Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of 2.1547. This is a closer comparison as it has a bromine on the phenyl ring and an oxygen-containing group, similar to the acetamide group in terms of electron-withdrawing effects.

3. **Prediction**:
   - Considering the electron-withdrawing effects of both the acetamide group and the bromine, the property value should be slightly higher than that of Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 due to the additional carbonyl group in the acetamide, which can contribute to the overall property value.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be approximately **2.3**.

SMILES: CC(C)Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 2.8851000000000013
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is isobutylbenzene, which consists of an isobutyl group (CC(C)C) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1).

From the examples, we can observe that:
- The presence of a benzene ring generally contributes significantly to the property value, as seen in molecules like C=Cc1ccccc1 (2.3296) and CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (2.55742).
- The addition of alkyl groups to a benzene ring tends to increase the property value, as seen in CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (2.55742) and CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (3.11842).

Given that CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is similar to CCc1ccc(C)cc1 but with an additional methyl group, we can expect its property value to be slightly higher than 2.55742. However, it is likely to be lower than CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (3.11842) due to the different positioning and branching of the alkyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 would be around 2.8.

True Property: 1.4990999999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with benzene rings tend to have moderate to high property values, often above 1.0.
2. The presence of electron-withdrawing groups, such as carbonyl groups (C=O), can influence the property value.

For instance, the molecule NC(=O)c1ccccc1O has a property value of 0.4911, and it contains both a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring. The molecule COc1ccccc1, which is anisole, has a property value of 1.6952, and it contains a methoxy group attached to a benzene ring.

Considering benzaldehyde's structure, which is simpler than some of the more complex aromatic compounds listed, and the influence of the carbonyl group, we can predict that its property value will be somewhat similar to those of simpler aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) would be around 1.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group and an oxazole ring. The presence of the nitro group, which is electron-withdrawing, and the heterocyclic structure can influence the property value. In the examples, molecules with similar features, such as aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups, tend to have higher property values.

For instance, the molecule Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 has a property value of 4.6939, and it contains a nitro group and aromatic rings. Another example is CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2 with a property value of 4.2258, which also has aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups.

Considering these comparisons, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is likely to be in a similar range. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately 4.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples. This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group.

From the examples, we have:
- N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 with a property value of 4.102.

The given molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is structurally similar to the example N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, but it lacks the double bond between the nitrogen atoms. This structural difference could slightly affect the property value, likely reducing it due to the absence of the double bond, which might influence electronic properties.

Considering this, the predicted property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be slightly lower than 4.102. A reasonable estimate could be around 3.8 to 4.0, given the structural similarity and the effect of the missing double bond.

Therefore, the predicted property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is approximately 3.9.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a relatively small and compact structure with two amide groups and a cyclohexane ring. In the examples, similar small cyclic structures with amide groups, such as O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC (1.185) and O=C1CCCN1 (-0.1036), have property values around 1.185 and -0.1036, respectively.

Considering the structural similarity to these examples, particularly the presence of amide groups and a cyclic structure, the property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be in a similar range. Given the compact nature and the presence of two carbonyl groups, a value slightly above zero seems reasonable.

Therefore, a predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 would be approximately 0.5.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 5.313800000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

In the examples, we have:
- Clc1ccccc1Cl with a property value of 2.9934
- Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl with a property value of 6.4955

The target molecule, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is more similar to Clc1ccccc1Cl but with an additional phenyl ring and an extra chlorine atom. The presence of additional chlorine atoms and the biphenyl structure generally increases the property value due to increased molecular weight and hydrophobicity.

Considering these factors, the property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is likely to be higher than 2.9934 but lower than 6.4955. A reasonable estimate would be around 4.5.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 2.811400000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

In the examples, we have several aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions, such as:

- Cc1ccccc1N, with a property value of 1.57722
- Cc1ccccc1, which is toluene, with a property value of 1.57722 (not explicitly listed but inferred from similar structures)
- Cc1ccccn1, with a property value of 1.644

The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is similar to these structures but with two ethyl groups instead of a methyl or a single ethyl group. The presence of additional alkyl groups generally increases the property value due to increased hydrophobicity and molecular size.

Given the trend in the examples, we can predict that the property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 will be slightly higher than that of ethylbenzene (not listed but inferred to be around 1.6-1.7) and toluene. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be around 1.8.

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: -0.08379999999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a sulfonamide derivative, specifically a para-substituted aniline with a sulfonamide group.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) on aromatic rings tend to increase the property value, as seen in examples like Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (1.177) and Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (1.81142).
- Sulfur-containing groups, such as sulfonamides, can also influence the property value, but there are no direct examples with sulfonamides in the list.

Given the structure of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, it is similar to the nitrobenzene example (Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O) but with a sulfonamide group instead of a nitro group. The sulfonamide group is less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group, which might result in a slightly lower property value compared to nitrobenzene.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be slightly lower than that of nitrobenzene. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 1.0.

Predicted Property:
The molecule you provided, c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon known as triphenylene. Based on the examples you provided, the property values seem to be related to hydrophobicity or lipophilicity, possibly logP (partition coefficient).

Triphenylene is a larger, more complex aromatic system compared to many of the examples, and it is similar in structure to other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons like anthracene or phenanthrene. Given the trend in the examples, larger and more aromatic systems tend to have higher property values due to increased hydrophobicity.

Considering the examples, particularly those with similar aromatic systems, a reasonable prediction for the property value of triphenylene would be around 5.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule appears to be a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group, similar to some of the examples given.

The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings suggests a relatively high property value, as seen in examples with similar features. For instance, the molecule Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 has a property value of 3.5601, and it shares some structural similarities with the target molecule, such as the presence of aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups.

Considering these structural features and the property values of similar molecules, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 would be around 3.5.

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 1.24
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a thiophosphate with an amide and a thioester linkage.

1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains a thiophosphate group (P(=O)(OC)SC), an amide group (NC(C)=O), and a thioester linkage. These groups can influence the property value significantly.

2. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a thiophosphate group and a high property value of 4.5429.
   - The molecule COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a similar thiophosphate group and a high property value of 5.6015.
   - The presence of chlorine atoms in the examples tends to increase the property value, but our molecule does not have chlorine atoms.

3. **Structural Complexity**: The molecule is less complex than the examples with high property values, as it lacks aromatic rings and multiple halogen substitutions.

4. **Expected Influence**: The presence of the thiophosphate group suggests a higher property value, but the lack of additional complex features or halogens suggests it will not be as high as the examples with multiple chlorines.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is likely to be moderate, reflecting the influence of the thiophosphate group but without the additional complexity or halogenation seen in higher-value examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is approximately **3.0**.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 1.9352
Predicted Property:
The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, relatively simple molecule. Based on the examples provided, the property values seem to be related to the molecular size, complexity, and presence of certain functional groups. 

1,2-dichloroethene is less complex than many of the examples given, and it contains two chlorine atoms, which are electronegative and can influence the property value. Comparing it to other chlorinated compounds in the list, such as Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl (2.699) and Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (1.9222), we can infer that the presence of chlorine increases the property value, but the overall simplicity of the molecule should result in a lower value than more complex chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around 1.5.

Iteration: 58
SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 1.0816
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1, which is pyridine, we can analyze the given examples and their properties. Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle similar to benzene but with one nitrogen atom replacing a CH group.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as CNc1ccccc1 (aniline), have a property value of 1.7283. Pyridine is less electron-rich than aniline due to the presence of the nitrogen atom, which can affect its property value.

Considering the examples and the nature of pyridine, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be slightly lower than that of aniline. Therefore, a predicted property value for pyridine (c1ccncc1) could be around 1.5.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23

This molecule contains several key features:

1. An ester linkage (COC(=O)).
2. A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1).
3. An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23).
4. A chlorinated aromatic ring.
5. Hydroxyl groups (OCC(O)CO).

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens (like Cl) tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of an ester or amide linkage can also increase the property value.
- Hydroxyl groups can decrease the property value, but their effect might be less pronounced in the presence of other strong features like aromatic rings and halogens.

Considering these factors, the molecule has structural similarities with several examples, such as:

- Clc1ccc(I)cc1 (2.9446)
- Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (4.0058)
- O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 (3.3306)

Given the combination of aromatic rings, a chlorine atom, and functional groups, the property value is likely to be moderately high. Balancing these influences, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 3.5.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 1.1689
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property in question seems to be related to the molecular structure, possibly a measure of hydrophobicity or lipophilicity, such as the logP value.

The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol with five carbon atoms and one hydroxyl group. In the examples, we have:

- CCCCCC (hexane) with a property value of around 3.39.
- CCCCCCI (iodohexane) with a property value of 3.39.
- OC1CCCCCCC1 (cycloheptanol) with a property value of 2.09.

The presence of the hydroxyl group in CCCCCO (1-pentanol) will decrease the property value compared to a purely hydrocarbon chain like hexane due to the increased polarity and hydrogen bonding capability of the hydroxyl group.

Considering the examples and the effect of the hydroxyl group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO (1-pentanol) would be around 1.8.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we can analyze its structure and compare it to the examples provided.

This molecule contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is known to increase polarity.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which also contributes to polarity.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which can increase hydrophobicity.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can contribute to polarity.

From the examples, molecules with similar functional groups and aromatic rings tend to have property values in the range of 2 to 4. For instance:
- CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C has a property value of 3.8896.
- CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of 3.2711.

Considering the balance of polar and non-polar groups in the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be around 3.5.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:
- An ester group (COC(=O))
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring
- A bicyclic aromatic system
- A methyl group attached to a nitrogen-containing heterocycle

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and nitro groups, such as "Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O" with a property value of 1.90322, tend to have moderate property values.
- Molecules with ester groups, such as "CCCCCCCCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCCCC" with a property value of 6.7212, tend to have higher property values, especially when combined with large hydrophobic groups.
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings, as seen in "Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" with a property value of 8.5808, can significantly increase the property value.

Considering these factors, the given molecule has a combination of aromaticity, nitro group, and ester functionality, which suggests a moderate to high property value. However, the presence of the nitro group and the specific arrangement of the aromatic system might moderate the value compared to highly chlorinated aromatics.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately 3.5.

True Property: -0.8674000000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two carbonyl groups (C=O) and a cyclohexane-like structure due to the cyclization of the peptide bond. This structure is relatively small and compact, with no additional functional groups or extended conjugation.

Looking at the examples, smaller and less complex molecules with carbonyl groups, such as CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C (4.8401) and CC(=O)C(C)(C)C (1.6215), have property values in the range of 1.5 to 4.8. The diketopiperazine structure is more similar to the smaller, less complex molecules.

Considering the compact nature and the presence of carbonyl groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around 1.5 to 2.5. Given the lack of additional functional groups or extended conjugation, a value closer to the lower end of this range is more likely.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately 1.8.

SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 1.2451
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a physicochemical property such as hydrophobicity or logP (partition coefficient).

The molecule ClCC is a simple chlorinated ethane, also known as chloroethane. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons like CCCCC (pentane) have a property value of 2.1965, while aromatic chlorinated compounds like Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) have a value of 2.34. The presence of chlorine generally increases the property value compared to non-halogenated hydrocarbons.

Given that ClCC is a small, non-aromatic chlorinated hydrocarbon, its property value is likely to be lower than that of larger or aromatic chlorinated compounds but higher than non-chlorinated small hydrocarbons. Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be around 1.5.

SMILES: Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl
True Property: 3.5617
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples. The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a pyridine ring and a trichloromethyl group.

From the examples, we have:
- Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2 (4.007): A biphenyl structure with chlorine substitution.
- Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (5.3138): A biphenyl structure with multiple chlorine substitutions.
- Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl (4.8618): A highly chlorinated aromatic compound with a nitro group.

The molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is similar to these examples in that it is an aromatic compound with multiple chlorine atoms. The presence of the pyridine nitrogen might slightly affect the property, but the overall influence of the chlorine atoms is significant.

Considering the examples, the property values for highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to be higher. Given the structure of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be around 5.0, considering the influence of the trichloromethyl group and the pyridine nitrogen.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is approximately 5.0.

Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: 1.5574
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCC(C)O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples. The molecule CCCCC(C)O is a primary alcohol with a six-carbon chain, similar to the example molecule CCCCC(O)CCC, which has a property value of 1.9475. 

The main difference between these two molecules is the position of the hydroxyl group. In CCCCC(C)O, the hydroxyl group is at the end of the chain, making it a primary alcohol, whereas in CCCCC(O)CCC, the hydroxyl group is in the middle of the chain, making it a secondary alcohol. Primary alcohols generally have slightly lower property values compared to their secondary counterparts due to differences in molecular interactions and steric effects.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCCCC(C)O would be slightly lower than 1.9475. A reasonable estimate for the property value of CCCCC(C)O is approximately 1.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. The molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is 1,4-dibromobenzene, which is a benzene ring with two bromine atoms attached at the para positions.

In the examples, we have several halogenated aromatic compounds, such as:

- Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl (4.6604)
- ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 (5.929)
- ClC(Cl)Cl (1.9864)
- ClC(=C)Cl (1.9352)

The property values for these compounds are influenced by the presence of halogens and the aromatic system. The presence of bromine, which is larger and more polarizable than chlorine, might slightly increase the property value compared to chlorinated analogs.

Considering the structure of 1,4-dibromobenzene and comparing it to the examples, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be slightly higher than that of ClC(Cl)Cl (1.9864) due to the larger size and polarizability of bromine compared to chlorine.

Therefore, a predicted property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 could be approximately 2.1.

This molecule is a chlorinated biphenyl, similar to the example Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 9.8876. The given molecule has fewer chlorine atoms than the example, which suggests a lower property value due to decreased molecular weight and possibly lower hydrophobicity.

Considering the pattern in the examples, the property value seems to correlate with the number of chlorine atoms and the overall size of the molecule. The given molecule has 6 chlorine atoms, while the example has 10. Therefore, we can estimate the property value to be somewhat lower than 9.8876.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately 7.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a triaryl phosphate ester, which includes:
- Three aromatic rings (phenyl groups).
- Two of these phenyl groups have a methyl substituent (C).
- A phosphate group (P(=O)(O)(O)) linking the aromatic rings.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have higher property values (e.g., Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, 5.3138).
- Molecules with phosphate or similar functional groups (e.g., CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCCSCC, 3.7702) also have relatively high property values.

Given the structure of the molecule, it is likely to have a property value in the higher range due to the presence of multiple aromatic rings and the phosphate ester group. However, it lacks halogen substituents, which in the examples often contribute to even higher values.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1 would be around 3.5 to 4.0. A specific prediction could be 3.8, aligning with the presence of the phosphate group and multiple aromatic rings.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to increase lipophilicity and potentially increase the property value.
- An aromatic ring, which is common in many of the examples and contributes to moderate property values.
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle, which can affect the property depending on its specific interactions and environment.
- Chlorine atoms, which are present in several examples with higher property values, indicating a potential increase in the property value.
- A ketone group, which can have varying effects depending on the rest of the structure.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, particularly those with similar functional groups and structural complexity, the predicted property value for this molecule is likely to be in the higher range, but not as high as the most complex or heavily halogenated examples.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O would be approximately 4.5.

True Property: 1.6033999999999997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) and a nitro group (NO2) attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups tend to have higher property values.
- Methoxy groups (OCH3) are electron-donating and can influence the property value by stabilizing the aromatic system.

Let's compare with similar structures:
- c1ccccc1O (phenol) has a property value of 1.3922.
- O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (dinitrobenzene) has a property value of 1.503.

Given that COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has both a methoxy group and a nitro group, it is likely to have a property value between those of phenol and dinitrobenzene. The methoxy group will slightly lower the property value compared to dinitrobenzene due to its electron-donating nature.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around 1.45.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to hexachlorocyclohexane derivatives. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in the examples with high chlorine content, such as ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 3.6444.

Given the high degree of chlorination and the structural complexity of the molecule, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be relatively high, similar to other highly chlorinated compounds.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl would be approximately 4.0.

- Simple aliphatic chains like CCC#C have a property value of 1.0296.
- Esters like CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 have a property value of 1.4455.
- The presence of an ester functional group tends to increase the property value compared to simple alkanes or alkynes.

Given that CCCOC=O is a relatively simple ester without additional aromatic or complex functional groups, its property value is likely to be closer to the lower end of the ester examples provided. 

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be approximately 1.2.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically a decanoate ester, with a long alkyl chain (10 carbons) and an ethyl group attached to the ester functional group.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with long alkyl chains, such as CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 (3.8094) and CCCCCC=C(CC)C=O (2.3218), tend to have higher property values.
2. Esters, such as CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C (4.0575) and CCOC (1.0428), show a range of property values depending on the size and complexity of the molecule.

Considering the structure of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, it is a relatively simple ester with a long alkyl chain, which suggests a moderate to high property value. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 3.5.

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 3.8595000000000006
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we can analyze its structure and compare it to the examples provided.

This molecule contains:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Aromatic rings with chlorine substituents tend to have property values around 2.0 to 3.0.
- The presence of a nitro group, as seen in Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, has a property value of 2.2482.
- The combination of multiple electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro and chloro) tends to increase the property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule in question has structural similarities to Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, but with an additional phenol group and amide linkage, which might slightly increase the property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be around 2.5 to 3.0. Given the examples and the structural analysis, a specific prediction could be approximately 2.8.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1
True Property: 5.630000000000004
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- Two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)OC), which are similar to the phosphorothioate group in the example molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 4.3319.
- Two aromatic rings connected by a sulfur atom, which is a feature that can increase the property value due to increased hydrophobicity and molecular size.

Given the presence of two phosphorothioate groups and the aromatic structure, the property value is likely to be higher than the example with one phosphorothioate group. Additionally, the absence of chlorine atoms, which tend to increase the property value significantly, suggests that the value might not be as high as those with multiple chlorines.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 would be around 4.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

In the examples, we have a similar molecule: Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which is nitrotoluene, with a property value of 1.90322. The presence of the nitro group is a significant factor in determining the property value, as it contributes to the molecule's polarity and other properties.

Additionally, we have another example, Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, which is chlorophenylamine, with a property value of 1.9222. This molecule has a similar aromatic structure with a substituent that affects its properties.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of the nitro group, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (4-nitrophenol) would likely be close to these examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately 1.9.

True Property: -7.571399999999989
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a complex sugar-like structure with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, resembling polysaccharides or oligosaccharides.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic ether structures, such as sugars, tend to have lower property values, often negative. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O has a property value of -2.5823, which is a cyclic sugar-like structure.

Given the complexity and the high number of hydroxyl groups in the molecule OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and possibly lower than the simpler sugar-like structure provided in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be approximately -3.0.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 1.0295999999999998
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne, with a terminal triple bond.

In the examples, simpler linear and branched alkanes and alkenes, such as CCC(=O)C (1.3755) and CCC(C)C(=O)C (1.6215), have property values in the range of 1.3 to 1.6. The presence of a triple bond in CCC#C might slightly increase the property value compared to a similar alkane due to the increased electron density and potential for interactions.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be slightly higher than that of a simple alkane but not as high as more complex aromatic or halogenated compounds. Therefore, a predicted property value for CCC#C could be around 1.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), an ether linkage (O), and a chlorinated aromatic ring, which are features that can influence the property value.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms on an aromatic ring tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 7.274, and Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has a property value of 5.1447. The presence of a phosphorothioate group, as seen in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 4.3319, also contributes to a higher property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is expected to have a relatively high property value due to the combination of the phosphorothioate group and the chlorinated aromatic ring. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 4.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a pyridine ring with a carbonyl group and a hydrazine moiety attached. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings, such as pyridine or benzene derivatives, tend to have property values around 2 to 3.
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like carbonyls and nitro groups can increase the property value.
- The presence of nitrogen in the ring, as seen in pyridine derivatives, can also influence the property value.

Given these observations, the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 has a pyridine ring, which is similar to the structure of Nc1cccc2ccccc12 (property value 2.422). The additional carbonyl and hydrazine group could increase the property value slightly due to their electron-withdrawing nature.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be around 1.8 to 2.0. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately 1.9.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule contains several functional groups and structural features that can influence its property value:

1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S)(O)O)**: This group is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, which has a property value of 2.79932. The presence of this group suggests a moderate contribution to the property value.

2. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: The amide group is present in several examples, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C with a property value of 0.2296, indicating a relatively low contribution to the property value.

3. **Cyclohexyl Group (N1CCCCC1)**: This group is similar to the cyclohexyl group in C/C1CCC(\C)CC1 and C/C1CCCCC1\C, both with a property value of 2.8326. This suggests a moderate contribution to the property value.

4. **Alkyl Chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)**: These are common in many examples and generally contribute to increasing the property value. For instance, CCCc1ccccc1 has a property value of 2.6391.

Considering these structural features and their contributions, the predicted property value for CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is likely to be in the moderate range, similar to other molecules with phosphorothioate and cyclohexyl groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately:

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 3.3668000000000022
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC, we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The property in question seems to be related to the molecular structure, possibly a measure of hydrophobicity or lipophilicity, such as the logP value.

From the examples, we observe that:

- Linear alkanes like CCCCCCCO (octanol) have a property value of 1.9491.
- Linear alkanes with a double bond like CCCC/C=C/C have a property value of 2.7527.
- Cyclic alkanes like CCCCCCC1CCCC1 have a property value of 3.7569.

The molecule CCCCCCCC is a linear alkane (octane). Based on the trend that longer carbon chains tend to have higher property values, and considering that CCCCCCCO (octanol) has a value of 1.9491, we can predict that CCCCCCCC (octane) will have a slightly higher value due to the absence of the polar -OH group.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCC is approximately 2.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group and a carbon-carbon triple bond (alkyne). It resembles some of the polycyclic structures in the examples, such as:

- CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO, which has a property value of 1.8957.
- CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 3.8792.

The presence of the hydroxyl group and the alkyne could influence the property value, potentially lowering it compared to similar structures without these features. However, the overall polycyclic nature and the presence of a ketone group suggest a property value in a similar range to the examples.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C would be around 3.5.

True Property: 1.338599999999999
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like the one you've provided involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples given. The examples suggest that the property values are likely related to some form of molecular descriptor, possibly related to hydrophobicity, electronic properties, or steric factors.

The molecule you've provided, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and hydroxyl groups, as well as a lactone moiety. This suggests a balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions, with potential for significant steric hindrance due to the polycyclic nature.

Given the examples, molecules with extensive aromatic systems and halogen substitutions tend to have higher property values, while those with more polar functional groups or smaller, less complex structures tend to have lower values. The presence of multiple ether and hydroxyl groups in your molecule suggests a moderate property value, potentially lower than those with extensive halogenation or purely aromatic systems.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of your molecule might be around 3.5. This accounts for the balance of hydrophilic and hydrophobic features, as well as the complexity of the structure.

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 2.0456000000000003
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their properties. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which consists of a phenol group (a benzene ring with an -OH group) and a chlorine atom attached to the benzene ring. In the examples, we have:

- Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O with a property value of 1.3004, which is a nitrophenol.
- Fc1ccccc1 with a property value of 1.8257, which is a fluorobenzene.
- Clc1ccccc1I with a property value of 2.9446, which is a chloroiodobenzene.

The presence of the -OH group in phenol generally decreases the property value compared to halogenated benzenes due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding. The addition of a chlorine atom, which is less electronegative than fluorine but more than iodine, will increase the property value compared to phenol alone.

Considering these factors, the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is likely to be between that of phenol derivatives and chlorinated benzenes. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around 1.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule contains:

1. A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C), which is relatively small and polarizable.
2. An ester linkage (OC(=O)), which is polar and can contribute to solubility and reactivity.
3. An amide group (NC(=O)), which is polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.
4. A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1), which is similar to some of the examples provided and tends to increase the property value due to its size and polarizability.

Comparing this structure to the examples, we see similarities with molecules that have chlorinated aromatic rings and polar functional groups. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a high property value of 7.9274, largely due to extensive chlorination. However, our target molecule has fewer chlorine atoms and additional polar groups, which might moderate the property value.

Considering these factors, the property value for ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 is likely to be higher than those of simple aromatic compounds but lower than heavily chlorinated ones. A reasonable prediction, based on the balance of polar and non-polar characteristics, would be around 3.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent, similar to Oc1ccc(O)cc1, which has a property value of 1.0978.
- A chlorinated phenyl ring, similar to Clc1cccc(Cl)c1, which has a property value of 2.9934.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2), which is a heterocyclic aromatic compound.
- Another chlorinated phenyl ring, similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, which has a property value of 3.1025.

The presence of multiple aromatic rings and chlorine substituents suggests a relatively high property value, as seen in other chlorinated aromatic compounds. The pyrimidine ring adds some complexity, but it is not expected to drastically lower the property value.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl would be around 3.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCCCOC=O is an ester, specifically a linear ester with a five-carbon alkyl chain and an ester functional group.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCC(=O)OCC (an ester with a similar structure but with an additional ethyl group on the ester side) has a property value of 1.3496.
- CCCCCCC=O (a ketone with a similar carbon chain length) has a property value of 1.7656.

The molecule CCCCCOC=O is structurally closer to CCCCC(=O)OCC, but it lacks the additional ethyl group, which might slightly lower its property value. Considering these comparisons, the property value for CCCCCOC=O is likely to be slightly lower than 1.3496.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be approximately 1.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we can look at the example provided for a similar molecule, ClCCCl, which has a property value of 1.464. The molecule ClCCl is a smaller and simpler structure compared to ClCCCl, as it lacks one carbon atom. This reduction in size and complexity typically results in a lower property value.

Considering the trend in the examples, where smaller and less complex molecules tend to have lower property values, we can predict that the property value for ClCCl will be slightly lower than that of ClCCCl.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be approximately 1.2.

To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methylphenol, specifically para-cresol, which consists of a benzene ring with a methyl group and a hydroxyl group attached.

Looking at the examples, we can find a similar structure: CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, which is a methylated phenol with a property value of 2.82402. The structure Cc1cccc(C)c1O is slightly simpler, with only one methyl group instead of two.

Considering the structural similarity and the effect of the additional methyl group in the example, we can predict that the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O will be slightly lower than 2.82402. A reasonable estimate for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be around 2.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns related to the structure and the property values.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl, which is similar to the chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples. Notably, the examples include:

1. Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of 6.6206
2. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of 7.274
3. Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl with a property value of 4.0058

The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a biphenyl with four chlorine atoms, similar to the first two examples, which have high property values due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings. The property value tends to increase with the number of chlorine atoms and the presence of multiple aromatic rings.

Given the structure of the molecule and the pattern observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl would be around 6.0. This value is slightly lower than the first two examples due to having fewer chlorine atoms but still reflects the influence of the chlorinated aromatic structure.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 1.9725
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple hydrocarbon with a branched structure and a double bond.

Looking at the examples, we can see that hydrocarbons with similar structures, such as alkenes and alkanes, have property values that are generally in the range of 2 to 4. For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCC=C (an alkene) has a property value of 3.923, and the molecule CCCCCCCC (an alkane) has a property value of 3.3668.

Given that isoprene is a smaller molecule with a branched structure, its property value is likely to be slightly lower than those of the larger linear alkenes and alkanes. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around 2.5.

Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1.4215
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we need to consider the nature of the molecule and compare it to the examples provided. ClCCl is a simple dihalogenated methane, commonly known as dichloromethane or methylene chloride. 

In the examples, the property values seem to be related to molecular size, complexity, and possibly hydrophobicity or logP (partition coefficient). Smaller, less complex molecules with fewer carbon atoms and more polar groups tend to have lower property values, while larger, more complex, and more hydrophobic molecules have higher values.

Given that ClCCl is a small, simple molecule with two chlorine atoms, it is likely to have a relatively low property value compared to larger, more complex structures. The closest example in terms of simplicity and halogenation is ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl, which has a property value of 3.0682. However, ClCCl is even simpler and smaller.

Therefore, I would predict the property value for ClCCl to be lower than 3.0682, likely around 1.5 to 2.0, considering its small size and the presence of two chlorine atoms. A reasonable estimate would be:

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can look at similar structures from the examples provided. The molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we have:

- Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, with a property value of 3.3524.

The structure of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is very similar to Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, with both being chlorinated phenols. The difference is in the position of the chlorine atoms, but the overall structure and the presence of three chlorine atoms and a hydroxyl group are consistent.

Given this similarity, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl would be very close to 3.3524. Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is approximately 3.35.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be quite complex, with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and a significant degree of oxygenation, which suggests a high degree of polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. The presence of multiple methoxy groups and a fused ring system also suggests a relatively large and complex structure.

Based on the examples provided, molecules with high aromatic content and significant oxygenation, such as those with multiple ether and hydroxyl groups, tend to have lower property values, often negative, due to increased solubility in polar solvents and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Considering these factors, I would predict the property value for this molecule to be around -2.5. This is a rough estimate based on the structural complexity and the presence of multiple polar functional groups.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.3714999999999997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The property values given seem to be related to the hydrophobicity or lipophilicity of the molecules, often represented by logP values.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A thioether group (CS-), which can increase lipophilicity.
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C), which is highly hydrophobic and increases lipophilicity.
- A pyrazole ring with a carbonyl and an amine group, which can contribute to hydrophilicity but are less dominant compared to the hydrophobic groups.

Comparing with similar structures:
- The molecule CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a logP of 1.0258. It also contains a pyrazole ring and a tert-butyl group, but with additional polar groups.
- The molecule CC(C)CCCO has a logP of 1.4149, which is a simple alcohol with a hydrophobic chain.

Given the balance of hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups in CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, and considering the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 1.2. This accounts for the significant hydrophobic contribution from the tert-butyl group and the thioether, slightly offset by the polar groups in the pyrazole ring.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 1.8633
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples. This molecule is an ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ethyl ester group attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we have:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 with a property value of 1.1716. This molecule is more complex due to the additional sulfonamide and heterocyclic groups.
- CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O with a property value of 2.0119. This molecule is a diketone with a benzene ring, which is somewhat similar in terms of aromatic content but has additional carbonyl groups.
- CCCCCC(=O)OC with a property value of 1.7397. This is a simple ester with a longer alkyl chain but no aromatic ring.

Considering the structure of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, it is simpler than the first example and lacks the additional functional groups that increase the property value. It is more similar to the third example but with an aromatic ring, which typically increases the property value due to increased hydrophobicity and potential for π-π interactions.

Given these considerations, the predicted property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is likely to be slightly higher than the simple ester example but lower than the diketone example. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is around 1.5.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 3.351700000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the size, functional groups, and presence of halogens.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with seven carbon atoms and a bromine atom attached. In the examples, the molecule Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which contains a bromine atom attached to an aromatic ring, has a property value of 3.6023. The molecule CCCCCCCCO, which is a linear alkyl chain with an alcohol group, has a property value of 1.9491.

Considering the linear structure and the presence of a bromine atom, which is a heavy halogen, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be higher than that of CCCCCCCCO but lower than that of Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 due to the absence of an aromatic ring.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around 2.5.

SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.3915
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of organic and inorganic compounds with different functional groups and structural complexities. The property values range from negative to positive, indicating a diverse set of properties being measured.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is a small, non-polar molecule with a relatively high bond order. In the context of the examples provided, simpler and smaller molecules tend to have lower property values, often negative or close to zero, especially when they lack complex functional groups or large hydrocarbon chains.

Given this analysis and the nature of CO as a small, simple molecule, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is negative or close to zero. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO would be:

-0.5
