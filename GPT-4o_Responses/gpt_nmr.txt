SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.23719983601726377
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The molecule is a long-chain ester, similar to the example CCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which has a property value of 0.59608356. The additional carbon in the chain might slightly affect the property, but based on the trend that longer carbon chains in esters tend to have slightly higher property values, we can predict a similar or slightly higher value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be approximately 0.65.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.2595513665007123
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a fused heterocyclic structure, specifically a chlorinated benzoxazole. The presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in several examples. The heterocyclic structure with an oxygen and nitrogen atom can also influence the property, potentially increasing it due to the presence of electronegative atoms and aromatic stabilization.

Comparing with similar structures:
- The molecule Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 0.18009869, which is a chlorinated aromatic compound.
- The molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 has a property value of -0.40404929, which is a less chlorinated aromatic compound.

Considering these comparisons and the structural features, the predicted property value for Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would likely be slightly positive, reflecting the influence of the chlorine atom and the heterocyclic structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is approximately 0.1.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.0257568566934232
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have negative property values. Additionally, smaller aliphatic molecules with halogens or simple functional groups tend to have negative values, such as ClCC and CCCCCBr.

Considering these observations, the presence of the nitro group, and the relatively small size of the molecule, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O. Based on the trends in the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.5. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.5.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO

This molecule appears to be a polycyclic compound with multiple rings and carbonyl groups, similar to some of the examples provided. Notably, it resembles the structure of steroids or terpenes, which are often complex polycyclic compounds.

From the examples, we can observe that complex polycyclic structures with multiple rings and carbonyl groups tend to have higher property values. For instance:

- CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C has a property value of 1.64626737.
- C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13 has a property value of 0.91983291.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple rings and carbonyl groups in the molecule CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, it is reasonable to predict a relatively high property value, similar to the examples with complex polycyclic structures.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A difluorobenzene moiety (Fc1cccc(F)c1), which is similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 with a property value of -0.66377944.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N), which is a common feature in several molecules with negative property values.
- A chlorobenzene moiety (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), which is similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of -0.46875252.

Considering these components, the molecule has structural similarities to other molecules with negative property values. The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like fluorine and chlorine, along with the amide linkage, suggests a negative property value.

Based on these observations and the trends in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be approximately -0.5.

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.6663056919756145
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with an alkyl chain. It is similar in structure to other small aliphatic ethers and alcohols in the examples, such as CCCCCO (-0.85162402) and CCCCCC(O)CC (-0.31415346). These molecules have negative property values, likely due to their non-polar, hydrophobic nature and lack of significant functional groups that would contribute to a positive property value.

Given the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that CCCOC(C)C will also have a negative property value. Considering the examples, a value around -0.7 to -0.8 seems plausible.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is approximately -0.75.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Alkyl Chain**: The presence of a propyl group (CCC(C)) is similar to other alkyl chains in the examples, which generally contribute to a negative property value.

2. **Pyrrole Ring**: The pyrrole ring is a five-membered aromatic heterocycle, which can contribute to a slightly positive or neutral property value, depending on the substitution.

3. **Carbonyl Groups**: The presence of two carbonyl groups (C=O) on the pyrrole ring can increase the electron-withdrawing nature, potentially leading to a more positive property value.

4. **Bromine Substitution**: The presence of a bromine atom (Br) is similar to other halogen substitutions in the examples, which can have varying effects but often contribute to a slightly positive property value.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.00300041) and other halogenated aromatic compounds, the property value is likely to be slightly positive or close to neutral.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O would be approximately **0.05**.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.13039753073381044
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a physicochemical property such as hydrophobicity or electronic characteristics.

Biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic compound consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples, similar aromatic compounds with multiple benzene rings tend to have positive property values. For instance:

- Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34 has a property value of 1.35444212.
- c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67 has a property value of 2.19640806.

These examples suggest that the presence of multiple aromatic rings contributes to a higher property value. Given that biphenyl is less complex than the examples with higher values but still consists of two aromatic rings, we can expect its property value to be positive but lower than those of more complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around 0.5.

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.7680554864559923
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the examples provided and identify patterns or trends in the data. The examples include a variety of molecular structures with different functional groups and their corresponding property values.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear alkane chain with a sulfur atom at the end. In the examples, linear alkanes and similar structures tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCCCCCC=C has a property value of -0.19238018, and CCCCCCC(C)O has a property value of -0.1347116. These examples suggest that linear alkanes and similar structures generally have negative property values.

Considering the presence of sulfur, which is less common in the examples, we can look at the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C)C=O, which has a property value of 0.43032235. However, this molecule is more complex and contains additional functional groups that likely contribute to its positive property value.

Given the simplicity of CCCCCS and its similarity to linear alkanes, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value, but slightly adjusted due to the presence of sulfur. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be around -0.2.

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.49546086898980596
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol, specifically 2-methyl-2-pentanol. In the examples, we have several aliphatic and alcohol-containing molecules:

1. CCC(C)(C)C: -0.729773
2. CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O: -0.04559308
3. CCCC(C)(O)CC: -0.49359533
4. CC(C)CC(C)O: -0.67575777

The presence of the alcohol group (OH) generally increases the property value compared to similar hydrocarbons without the OH group. Comparing the examples, the presence of the OH group in a similar branched structure (example 3) results in a property value of -0.49359533, which is higher than the corresponding hydrocarbon (example 1).

Considering the structural similarity and the effect of the alcohol group, the predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is likely to be slightly higher than -0.49359533 but still negative, as the examples with alcohol groups tend to have negative values.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO is approximately -0.45.

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: 0.006300092316756332
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a naphthalene derivative, specifically 1-methyl-naphthalene.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a property value of 0.68667897.
- Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (another naphthalene derivative) has a property value of 0.19040581.

The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is similar to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, but without the additional methyl group on the second ring. Given the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, we can predict that the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 will be close to that of Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, but slightly lower due to the absence of the additional methyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately 0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a cyclic compound with a diketopiperazine core, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -0.15237207. The main difference is the presence of a longer alkyl side chain (C(C)CCC) in the new molecule, which could slightly increase the hydrophobicity and potentially the property value.

Considering the structural similarity and the effect of the additional alkyl chain, the property value is likely to be slightly higher than -0.15237207. However, it is still expected to be negative due to the presence of the polar diketopiperazine core.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be around -0.1.

True Property: -0.6637794365740766
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have property values around the range of -0.5 to 1.0. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of -0.16921636, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1.29869349. The presence of multiple halogens tends to increase the property value.

Considering the trifluoromethyl group, which is electron-withdrawing and increases the overall electron density of the aromatic ring, we can expect the property value to be slightly positive but not as high as those with multiple halogens.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around 0.2.

The molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a sugar alcohol, specifically a form of glucose, which is a polyol with multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups. In the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a property value of -0.40125098. This suggests that the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups tends to result in a negative property value, likely due to increased hydrophilicity and hydrogen bonding potential.

Given the structural similarity to the example with a similar polyol structure, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O will also be negative and close to the example provided.

Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately -0.401.

CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C

This molecule contains several key features:

1. **Ester Groups**: The presence of ester groups (CC(=O)O) is similar to the ester group in CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of 1.87946017.

2. **Multiple Rings and Carbonyls**: The structure has multiple rings and carbonyl groups, similar to the example CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C.

3. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (C3(O) and C(O)) can influence the property, as seen in other molecules with hydroxyl groups.

4. **Complex Polycyclic Structure**: The complex polycyclic structure is similar to other molecules with high property values.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, particularly the one with a similar ester and polycyclic structure, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be close to that of CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which is 1.87946017.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C is approximately **1.879**.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with multiple fused rings and an alcohol group. It resembles some of the more complex structures in the examples, such as CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 1.17403639. This suggests that the presence of multiple rings and an alcohol group tends to increase the property value.

Given the structural complexity and the presence of an alcohol group, the property value is likely to be positive and relatively high, similar to other polycyclic compounds with alcohol groups in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O would be approximately 1.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is an acetanilide derivative with a nitro group attached to the aromatic ring. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those containing aromatic rings with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (-0.59955814) and COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (-0.34491159).

The presence of the nitro group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, generally contributes to a more negative property value. The acetamide group (CC(=O)N-) is also present, which can have a stabilizing effect but is less electron-withdrawing compared to the nitro group.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is likely to be in the range of the examples with nitro groups on aromatic rings. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.4.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)SC), which is not directly represented in the examples but can be considered similar to other sulfur-containing groups.
- An aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent, similar to Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (0.01691037) and Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl (0.51982952).
- An amide-like linkage (n1c(=O)oc2), which is somewhat similar to the amide groups in CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 (1.41641699) and COC(=O)Nc2nc1ccc(cc1[nH]2)C(=O)c3ccccc3 (1.3009438).

Considering these features, the presence of the phosphorothioate group might lower the property value compared to the examples with amide linkages and aromatic rings. The chlorine substituent on the aromatic ring could contribute to a moderate increase in the property value, as seen in the examples with chlorinated aromatic rings.

Balancing these factors, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 is likely to be around 0.3.

SMILES: CC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.8543445978789622
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CC(C)(C)CO is a simple alcohol with a tertiary butyl group, also known as tert-butanol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Simple alcohols like CCC(C)O (isobutanol) have a property value of -1.03378646.
2. Longer chain alcohols like CCCCCCCC(C)O (nonanol) have a property value of -0.1347116.
3. The presence of branching, as seen in isobutanol, tends to result in more negative property values compared to linear alcohols.

Given that tert-butanol is a branched alcohol similar to isobutanol, we can expect its property value to be in a similar range. However, tert-butanol is slightly more branched than isobutanol, which might make its property value slightly more negative.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO (tert-butanol) would be slightly more negative than -1.03378646. Therefore, a predicted property value could be approximately:

Both of these examples contain nitrogen heterocycles with carbonyl groups and have negative property values.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of nitrogen heterocycles and carbonyl groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 will also be negative and in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is approximately -0.75.

For instance, CC(C)O (isopropanol) has a property value of -1.21136278, and CCC(C)(C)C (2,2-dimethylpropane) has a property value of -0.729773. Esters like CCC(=O)CC (pentan-2-one) have a property value of -0.71189489.

Given the structural similarity of CC(C)OC=O to these small esters and alcohols, we can predict that its property value will also be negative and likely closer to the values of small esters.

Looking at the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and amide or urea linkages tend to have property values around neutral or slightly positive. For instance, the molecule CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1 has a property value of 0.09626199, and it contains an amide linkage and aromatic rings. Similarly, the molecule c3ccc2nc1ccccc1cc2c3, which is a polycyclic aromatic compound, has a property value of 0.41687489.

Given the structure of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, which is a symmetrical molecule with two phenyl rings and a central urea linkage, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly positive, reflecting the influence of the aromatic rings and the urea linkage.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 would be approximately 0.1.

The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the aromaticity, size, and presence of functional groups.

Triphenylene is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a planar structure and high aromaticity, similar to the example c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1, which has a property value of 1.18295213. Given that triphenylene is also a highly aromatic compound with a similar structure, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be in a similar range.

- An aniline moiety (c1ccc(N)cc1), which is a phenyl group with an amino substituent, contributing to aromaticity and potential hydrogen bonding.
- A guanidine group (NC(=N)N), which is highly polar and basic, contributing to hydrogen bonding and solubility.

From the examples, molecules with polar functional groups and aromatic systems tend to have positive property values, especially when they can engage in hydrogen bonding or have significant aromatic character. For instance, molecules like Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O (1.19136261) and CCN(CC)c1nc(Cl)nc(n1)N(CC)CC (0.91085499) have positive values due to their polar and aromatic nature.

Considering these factors, the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is likely to have a positive property value due to its polar functional groups and aromatic character. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.5. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is approximately 0.5.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.1244129599436081
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with positive property values.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which is an electron-withdrawing group and can influence the property value.
- An alkene group (CC(C)=C), which can also affect the property value.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (-0.53485491) and Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O (1.36655648), show a range of property values depending on the overall structure.
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like trifluoromethyl can increase the property value, as seen in some examples with halogens and other electron-withdrawing groups.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a positive property value, but not extremely high due to the balance of electron-withdrawing and donating effects.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O would be around 0.8.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -1.0197482553845363
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl acetate, an ester. Esters in the examples tend to have negative property values, likely due to their polar nature and the presence of the carbonyl group. For instance, CCC(C)(C)O has a property value of -0.85247906, and CCC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of -0.66273007. Both of these molecules contain ester or similar functional groups.

Given the structural similarity of CC(C)OC=O to these examples, particularly CCC(C)CCOC=O, we can infer that the property value for CC(C)OC=O will also be negative and likely in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O is approximately -0.7.

True Property: -0.4252698342947853
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is structurally similar to c1ccccc1O (phenol), which has a property value of -0.79348128. The presence of additional methyl groups in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 could slightly alter the property value, but it is likely to remain in a similar range due to the aromatic nature and the presence of the hydroxyl group.

Considering the examples and the structural similarity, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be slightly less negative than that of phenol due to the electron-donating effect of the methyl groups. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.6.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S) with methoxy groups (OC) and a substituted aromatic ring. The examples provided show that molecules with similar phosphorothioate groups and halogenated aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, often above 0.8. However, the molecule in question has a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) on the aromatic ring, which could influence the property value.

Considering the examples:
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl has a property value of 0.95492843.
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl has a property value of 1.14991648.
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of 0.85038032.

These examples have halogen substituents, which are generally more electronegative and can increase the property value. The presence of a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) might lower the property value compared to halogenated analogs.

Given these considerations, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be slightly lower than the halogenated examples but still positive. A reasonable estimate would be around 0.7.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples given.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with multiple chlorine atoms attached to the aromatic rings. In the examples, highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1.29869349, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1.49340948.

Given the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is likely to be in a similar range. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately 1.3 for this molecule.

True Property: -1.024901816403672
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a nitroalkane, specifically a nitropropane. 

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to have positive property values, indicating a certain level of electron-withdrawing effect or polarity. For instance, the molecule CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a property value of 1.12806631, and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.0823054. However, these examples are more complex than CCCN(=O)=O.

Considering the simpler structure of CCCN(=O)=O and its similarity to other nitroalkanes, we can expect a property value that is slightly positive but not as high as the more complex nitro compounds. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 0.1.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.560552754320492
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent. 

Looking at the examples, we have:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 with a property value of -0.36420441
- c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12 with a property value of 0.12145847

Both examples contain a bromine atom attached to an aromatic ring. The first example, Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, is a chlorobenzene with a bromine substituent, similar to our target molecule, but with chlorine instead of fluorine. The second example, c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12, is a naphthalene derivative with a bromine substituent, which is more complex than our target molecule.

Considering the electronegativity and the effect of fluorine compared to chlorine, fluorine is more electronegative, which might slightly lower the property value compared to the chlorobenzene example. However, the presence of bromine, which is a common feature, should have a similar effect.

Given these considerations, the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is likely to be slightly lower than -0.36420441 due to the higher electronegativity of fluorine compared to chlorine. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be approximately -0.40.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with an additional methyl group and a hydroxyl group. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with bicyclic or polycyclic frameworks and alcohol functionalities.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with polycyclic structures and alcohol groups tend to have property values that are slightly positive or close to zero. For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCC(C)O has a property value of 0.22417213, and CCCCCC(=O)C has a property value of -0.53245302. The presence of the alcohol group in the target molecule may slightly increase the property value compared to a similar structure without it.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 would be slightly positive, reflecting the influence of the alcohol group and the bicyclic structure. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately 0.1.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 1.86768394. The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of the SC(CCl) group in the example, which is replaced by a simpler structure in the molecule we are predicting.

Given that the example molecule has a relatively high property value and the structural difference involves removing a chlorine-containing group, which might contribute to a decrease in the property value, we can expect the property value of the molecule in question to be slightly lower than 1.86768394.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 1.5.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule CNc1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.48714755, and the molecule O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 0.30290191.

The presence of the carbonyl group and the nitrogen heterocycle in Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C suggests it might have a property value closer to the positive range, similar to the example with the carbonyl group and aromatic rings.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around 0.3.

2. CCCCCCCCI, a linear alkane with an iodine atom, has a property value of -0.03408113.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar to the first example but with one less carbon in the chain, which might slightly decrease the property value. Considering the trend in the examples, the property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is likely to be slightly lower than 0.05775797.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be approximately 0.05.

Looking at the examples, simple hydrocarbons and small molecules with few functional groups tend to have negative property values. For instance, CC/C=C/C (a linear hydrocarbon with a double bond) has a property value of -0.91014764, and C1CCCC1 (cyclopentane, a simple cyclic hydrocarbon) has a property value of -0.98865588.

Given that C=CCC=C is a simple linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value, similar to other small hydrocarbons in the examples.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is a simple compound with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. This structure is similar to other halogenated compounds in the examples, such as FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br, which has a property value of -0.92888079. The presence of multiple halogen atoms, especially bromine, tends to result in a negative property value, likely due to the high electronegativity and polarizability of bromine.

Considering the simplicity of BrC(Br)Br compared to more complex halogenated structures, we can expect its property value to be negative and possibly more negative than those of more complex structures with additional functional groups or rings.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be approximately -1.0.

- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is a feature in several examples with positive property values.
- A phenyl group (c1ccccc1), which is common in many examples with positive property values.

Considering these features and their presence in examples with positive property values, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for this molecule will also be positive and likely in a similar range to the example with the phosphorothioate group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is approximately 1.8.

   - The presence of a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C) is similar to CCC(C)C, which has a property value of -0.90921487.

3. **Overall Consideration**:
   - The combination of electron-withdrawing groups (such as the chloro and nitro groups) and the electron-donating tert-butyl group can influence the overall property.
   - The presence of both electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups suggests a balance that might lead to a property value closer to neutral or slightly positive.

Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings and heteroatoms like oxygen and nitrogen can also influence the property value.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2, have a positive property value (0.82043059).
- Molecules with heterocyclic structures and aromatic rings, such as CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, also tend to have positive property values (1.33393281).

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is likely to be positive and in the range of similar structures with nitro groups and aromatic rings. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.8.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.4510920510452662
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group (N-N linkage).

Looking at the examples, we have a similar structure: N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 0.33179838. The main difference between the two structures is the presence of a double bond in the example molecule, which is absent in the target molecule. The double bond in the example molecule contributes to a slightly higher electron density and potential resonance stabilization, which might slightly increase the property value.

Given that the target molecule lacks this double bond, we can expect its property value to be slightly lower than 0.33179838. However, the overall structure and aromaticity are quite similar, so the difference might not be substantial.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be slightly below 0.33179838. A predicted value could be around 0.30.

True Property: -0.23088031096664938
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a relatively small and compact structure with two amide groups and a cyclohexane ring. In the examples, similar cyclic structures with amide groups, such as C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1, have a property value of -0.00705408. Another example, O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, has a property value of 0.3868863, but it is larger and more complex due to additional alkyl groups.

Considering the size and functional groups of the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, it is likely to have a property value closer to the smaller cyclic amide example. Therefore, I would predict the property value to be slightly negative or close to zero.

True Property: 0.7145455105046593
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, tend to have higher property values (1.41913757).
- Simple chlorinated benzenes like Clc1ccccc1Cl have lower property values (-0.46875252).
- The presence of additional aromatic rings or complex structures tends to increase the property value.

Given that Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a more complex structure with multiple chlorine atoms and two aromatic rings, we can expect its property value to be higher than simple chlorinated benzenes but potentially lower than the highly chlorinated and complex structures.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 0.5 to 1.0. However, given the complexity and the presence of three chlorine atoms, a more specific prediction would be approximately:

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.12922379360878902
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

In the examples, we have several aromatic compounds and alkyl chains. For instance, Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) has a property value of -0.5025888, and Cc1ccccn1 (pyridine) has a property value of -0.57940251. These values are negative, likely due to the presence of polar functional groups or heteroatoms.

The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 lacks such polar functional groups or heteroatoms, consisting only of carbon and hydrogen. This suggests it might have a property value closer to neutral or slightly negative, similar to other hydrocarbons like CCCCCCCCCCCCCC (a long alkane) with a property value of 0.76335276, or CCCCCCC=C (an alkene) with -0.19238018.

Considering the structure of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, which is a non-polar hydrocarbon, the property value is likely to be slightly negative, reflecting its non-polar nature and similarity to other hydrocarbons.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is approximately -0.3.

To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a sulfonamide derivative, which is similar to some of the nitrobenzene derivatives in the examples.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O consists of a benzene ring with a sulfonamide group attached. In the examples, nitrobenzene derivatives such as Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O have a property value of -0.42806815. The sulfonamide group is somewhat similar in electronic nature to the nitro group, as both are electron-withdrawing groups, although the sulfonamide is generally less electron-withdrawing than the nitro group.

Considering the structural similarity and the electronic effects, the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is likely to be in the same range as the nitrobenzene derivatives, but slightly less negative due to the less electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonamide group compared to the nitro group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be around -0.35.

Based on the examples provided, the property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of aromatic rings, substituents, and overall molecular complexity. The molecule you provided, c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with three fused benzene rings, also known as triphenylene.

From the examples, molecules with multiple aromatic rings and complex structures tend to have higher property values.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the other polycyclic aromatic compounds in the examples, particularly those with multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings, which tend to have higher property values.

For instance, the molecule Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 has a property value of 1.53247317, and it shares some structural similarities with the given molecule, such as the presence of multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups.

Considering these structural similarities and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 is likely to be in the higher range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 1.5.

True Property: -0.2555676560598258
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)O), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (property value: 0.85038032) and CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C (property value: 1.77739946).
- An amide group (NC(C)=O), which is present in several molecules with varying property values, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (-0.10754852) and CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCCCC2 (0.48323379).
- A thioester linkage (SC), which is not directly present in the examples but can be considered similar to other sulfur-containing groups.

Considering the presence of the phosphorothioate group, which tends to increase the property value, and the amide group, which can have a neutral to slightly positive effect, the predicted property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is likely to be positive but not as high as the more complex phosphorothioate-containing molecules.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is approximately 0.5.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -1.0756756634277997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular structure.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, symmetrical molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. In the examples, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly chlorine, tend to have positive property values, especially when they are part of aromatic or complex structures. However, smaller and simpler molecules with halogens, like CCBr, have negative property values.

Considering the simplicity and symmetry of Cl\C=C/Cl, along with the presence of two chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly negative, similar to other small halogenated compounds.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl is approximately -0.5.

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.9438828624029861
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and their properties. Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle similar to benzene but with a nitrogen atom replacing one of the carbon atoms in the ring. 

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23, have a positive property value (0.33117654). However, simpler aromatic compounds like CNc1ccccc1 (aniline) have a negative property value (-0.48714755). 

Considering pyridine's structure, which is less complex than the polycyclic aromatic compounds with positive values but more similar to aniline, we can infer that its property value might be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the nitrogen atom and the aromaticity.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of pyridine (c1ccncc1) would be around -0.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has several key features:
1. An ester linkage (COC(=O)).
2. A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1).
3. An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23).
4. A pyridine-like structure (ccnc).
5. A chlorine substituent on an aromatic ring.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and amide linkages, such as CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2 (0.29723532) and O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 (0.66081011), tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of chlorine on an aromatic ring, as seen in Clc1ccc(I)cc1 (-0.16921636) and Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl (1.1039775), can either slightly decrease or increase the property value depending on the overall structure.
- The presence of an ester linkage, as in CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC (0.38212917), tends to contribute to a positive property value.

Considering these observations, the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 has features that are associated with positive property values, such as the amide linkage, aromatic rings, and ester group. The chlorine substituent may slightly modulate this value.

Based on these structural considerations and the trends from the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.5.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.8516240151388451
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the trends in the given examples. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol with a five-carbon chain and an alcohol group at the end. 

From the examples, we observe that:
- Linear alkanes and simple alcohols tend to have negative property values. For instance, OC1CCCCCCC1 has a property value of -0.39631506, and CCCCCC has a property value of -0.31426229.
- The presence of an alcohol group (OH) in a linear chain seems to slightly increase the property value compared to a similar alkane without the OH group.

Given these observations, CCCCCO, being a simple linear alcohol, is expected to have a property value slightly higher than a similar alkane but still negative. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be around -0.3 to -0.4.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value for CCCCCO to be approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a sulfonamide with a cyclic structure, which includes a benzene ring and a sulfonyl group. The presence of the sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) and the amide linkage (C(=O)N) are significant features that can influence the property value.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with similar functional groups and aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, especially when they contain sulfonyl or carbonyl groups. For instance, the molecule CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C has a property value of 1.68214797, and it contains a sulfonyl group and aromatic rings.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is likely to be positive and in the range of similar structures with sulfonyl and aromatic features.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 1.5.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:

1. **Aromatic Ring**: The presence of a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) is a common feature in several examples, often contributing to a positive property value due to its stability and electron delocalization.

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The nitro group is an electron-withdrawing group, which can influence the electronic properties of the molecule. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have positive property values.

3. **Ester Groups (C(=O)OC)**: The presence of ester groups can also contribute to the overall property value. In the examples, esters are associated with positive property values.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring**: The molecule contains a heterocyclic ring with a nitrogen atom, which can affect the electronic distribution and potentially increase the property value.

5. **Substituents**: The presence of methyl groups (C) can slightly increase the property value due to their electron-donating nature.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule has similarities with those having positive property values, particularly due to the presence of aromatic and nitro groups, as well as ester functionalities.

Based on these observations, I would predict a positive property value for this molecule. Given the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value would be around 0.8 to 1.2. Therefore, a specific prediction could be:

True Property: -0.5897640398558062
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two amide groups and a cyclohexane-like structure due to the cyclization of the peptide bond. This structure is relatively small and lacks significant functional groups that would contribute to a high property value, such as extensive aromatic systems or multiple halogen substitutions.

Looking at the examples, smaller molecules with amide groups and without extensive aromatic systems or halogenation tend to have lower property values. For instance, molecules like CC(=O)C(C)(C)C (-0.71461547) and OCc1ccccc1 (-0.62799211) have negative property values.

Given the structural simplicity and the presence of amide groups, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be negative and closer to the lower end of the spectrum provided by the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately -0.7.

SMILES: ClCC
True Property: -1.2487047256992443
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the trends and characteristics of the given examples. The property values seem to be influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the degree of saturation or aromaticity.

In the given examples, small, simple, and saturated hydrocarbons like CCCCC have negative property values, while more complex or aromatic structures tend to have positive values. Halogenated compounds, such as Clc1ccccc1 and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, have property values that are generally negative or slightly positive, depending on the complexity and number of halogen atoms.

ClCC is a small, simple molecule with a halogen (chlorine) attached to a short carbon chain. Based on the examples, small molecules with halogens tend to have negative property values. For instance, Clc1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.66346851, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a value of -0.07932053.

Considering these trends, ClCC is likely to have a negative property value, but not as negative as the smallest hydrocarbons like CC#N, which has a value of -1.44719067. A reasonable prediction for ClCC would be a value slightly less negative than Clc1ccccc1, given its smaller size and simpler structure.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCC is approximately -0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a pyridine ring and a trichloromethyl group.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values, as seen in Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (0.71454551) and Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2 (0.32511352).
- The presence of multiple chlorine atoms, especially in a trichloromethyl group, tends to increase the property value, as seen in Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (1.41913757).

Considering these observations, the presence of a pyridine ring (which is similar to benzene in terms of aromaticity) and the trichloromethyl group, we can expect the property value to be positive and likely higher than the simpler chlorinated aromatics but potentially lower than the highly chlorinated examples.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl would be around 0.8.

The molecule CCCCC(C)O is a primary alcohol with a five-carbon chain and a hydroxyl group attached to the second carbon. This structure is similar to the example molecule CCC(C)CCO, which has a property value of -0.67490273. Both molecules are alcohols with similar carbon chain lengths, and the presence of the hydroxyl group is a significant factor in determining the property value.

Given the similarity in structure, particularly the presence of the hydroxyl group and the comparable carbon chain length, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CCCCC(C)O will be close to that of CCC(C)CCO.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCC(C)O is approximately -0.67490273.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Simple halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have negative property values. For instance, ClCCl (dichloromethane) has a property value of -1.24174781, and ClC(Cl)Cl (chloroform) has a property value of -1.05620406.
- The presence of multiple halogen atoms generally results in a more negative property value. For example, ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl (carbon tetrachloride) has a property value of -0.68150209.
- The presence of bromine, which is less electronegative than chlorine, might result in a slightly less negative value compared to similar chlorinated compounds.

Considering these observations, we can predict that the property value for 1,4-dibromobenzene (Brc1ccc(Br)cc1) will be negative, but not as negative as the highly chlorinated compounds. A reasonable estimate, considering the trends, would be around -0.8 to -1.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately -0.9.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a chlorinated biphenyl, similar to the example Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 2.07755746. The given molecule has a similar structure but with fewer chlorine atoms.

Considering the pattern from the examples, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and the biphenyl structure tends to increase the property value. However, since the molecule in question has fewer chlorine atoms than the example with a value of 2.07755746, we can expect the property value to be slightly lower.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be around 1.8.

Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1

This molecule contains:

1. Aromatic rings: Three phenyl rings, which are common in the examples with positive property values.
2. Phosphate ester group: The presence of a phosphate group (P(=O)(O)O) is a significant feature that can influence the property value.
3. Alkyl groups: Methyl groups attached to the aromatic rings, which can affect the overall property.

Comparing with the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and additional functional groups like carbonyls, phosphates, or halogens tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule with a similar complexity and aromatic content, such as "Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1" has a property value of 1.79514932.

Given the structural complexity and the presence of the phosphate ester group, which is not directly represented in the examples but can be considered similar to other polar functional groups, the property value is likely to be positive and in the range of other complex aromatic systems.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately:

To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to be electron-withdrawing and can increase lipophilicity.
- An aromatic ring, which is common in many of the examples.
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle, which can influence the electronic properties.
- Multiple chlorine atoms, which are also electron-withdrawing and can increase lipophilicity.

Looking at the examples, molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro, chloro, and trifluoromethyl tend to have positive property values, especially when combined with aromatic systems. For instance, molecules with multiple chloro groups and aromatic systems, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, have high positive values.

Considering these factors, the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O is likely to have a positive property value due to the presence of the trifluoromethyl group, multiple chlorine atoms, and the aromatic system.

True Property: -0.34491159324527004
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring, and a nitro group (NO2) also attached to the benzene ring. 

From the examples, we can observe the following:
- Aromatic compounds with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.34093177.
- Aromatic compounds with methoxy groups, such as CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2, have a property value of 1.24955588.
- The presence of both electron-withdrawing (NO2) and electron-donating (OCH3) groups on the benzene ring can influence the property value.

Considering the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group and the electron-donating nature of the methoxy group, the property value is likely to be influenced by both. The nitro group tends to lower the property value, while the methoxy group tends to increase it.

Given these considerations, the predicted property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is likely to be around the average of the values for similar functional groups, slightly leaning towards the influence of the nitro group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately:

0.1

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 0.36234664. The given molecule has even more chlorine atoms and a more complex structure, which could potentially increase the property value due to increased molecular weight and potential for interactions.

Considering the trend that more chlorination and complex structures tend to increase the property value, I would predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is slightly higher than 0.36234664.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 0.45.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -1.0188932150947851
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. Esters generally have moderate to low polarity and are often less polar than alcohols or acids.

Looking at the examples, we can find some similar structures:

1. CCCCCC=C, which is a simple alkene, has a property value of -0.01293831.
2. CCC#C, which is a simple alkyne, has a property value of -1.142602.
3. CCCCCC#C, which is a longer alkyne, has a property value of -0.42483454.
4. CCCCCc1ccccc1, which is a simple alkyl benzene, has a property value of 0.04462144.

The molecule CCCOC=O is more polar than simple alkanes or alkenes due to the presence of the ester functional group, but it is not as polar as molecules with multiple electronegative atoms or groups like nitro groups.

Considering the examples and the nature of the ester group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be slightly negative, reflecting its moderate polarity. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.2.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.41664170046184207
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a simple ester, specifically decanoate ester, with a long alkyl chain. 

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with long alkyl chains, such as CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 (0.22406331) and CCCCC=C(CC)C=O (-0.35666451), tend to have property values around the range of -0.3 to 0.2.
2. Esters, such as CCCOC (-1.02433438), tend to have negative property values, but this example is a much smaller ester compared to the one we are predicting.
3. The presence of an ester functional group (C=O)O tends to lower the property value compared to simple hydrocarbons.

Considering these points, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is likely to be slightly negative, but not as negative as smaller esters due to the longer alkyl chain, which tends to increase the property value. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around -0.2.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.40484214.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, have a property value of -0.52713234.
- Molecules with phenol groups, such as Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1, have a property value of -0.1131024.
- Molecules with chlorine atoms on aromatic rings, such as COc1ccc(Cl)cc1, have a property value of -0.40882197.

Considering these structural features and their associated property values, the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O is likely to have a property value that is influenced by the presence of the nitro group, the amide linkage, and the chlorine atoms. These features tend to contribute to a negative property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.4 to -0.5. Given the specific structural features and their influence, a predicted property value could be approximately:

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule contains multiple phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are known to contribute to higher property values in the examples. Additionally, the presence of aromatic rings and sulfur atoms can also influence the property value.

Based on the examples, molecules with similar complex structures and functional groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, have relatively high property values. Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be in the higher range.

True Property: -0.5348549070667006
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. The molecule in question is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

In the examples, we have the following similar structures:
- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, with a property value of -0.41545242. This is nitrotoluene, which has a nitro group attached to a methyl-substituted benzene ring.
- Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, with a property value of -0.49197852. This is chlorophenylamine, which has an amine group attached to a chlorinated benzene ring.
- Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, with a property value of -0.42526983. This is a methylphenol (cresol), which has a hydroxyl group and a methyl group attached to a benzene ring.

The presence of the nitro group generally increases the electron-withdrawing character, which can affect the property value. The hydroxyl group also contributes to the overall property, but in the context of the examples, the nitro group seems to have a more significant impact.

Given the structural similarities and the influence of the nitro group, the property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is likely to be in the range of the nitrotoluene example, which is -0.41545242. Considering the additional electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group on the phenol, the property value might be slightly more negative.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.45.

True Property: 2.0502272664054444
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a complex sugar, specifically a polysaccharide, which is characterized by multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups and ether linkages.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, such as sugars and sugar-like structures, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, which is a sugar-like structure, has a property value of -0.72070957.

Given the complexity and the number of hydroxyl groups in the provided molecule, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and likely more negative than simpler sugar structures due to the increased number of hydroxyl groups and the overall complexity.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, would be approximately -0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCC#C is a simple alkyne, specifically 1-butyne, with a terminal triple bond.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with simple linear or branched alkane chains, such as CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO (1.48112022) and CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO (0.94279463), tend to have positive property values.
2. Molecules with carbonyl groups or other polar functional groups, such as CCC(C)C(=O)C (-0.71461547) and CCC(=O)C (-0.89133675), tend to have negative property values.
3. The presence of triple bonds, as seen in N#Cc1ccccc1C#N (-0.49168315), can contribute to a negative property value, likely due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the cyano group.

Considering the structure of CCC#C, it is a small alkyne with a terminal triple bond. The triple bond can have an electron-withdrawing effect, similar to the cyano group, but less pronounced since it is not as electronegative as a cyano group.

Based on these observations, we can predict that the property value for CCC#C will be slightly negative, but not as negative as molecules with strong electron-withdrawing groups like cyano. A reasonable estimate for the property value of CCC#C would be around -0.5, considering the examples provided.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCC#C is approximately:

- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 1.29869349.

Considering these structural similarities, particularly the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the chlorinated aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be positive and relatively high, similar to the examples with similar features.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl would be around 1.5.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is a pyridine ring with a carbonyl group (C=O) and a hydrazine group (NN) attached. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2, which has a pyrimidine ring with a carbonyl group and an amine group, and has a property value of -0.37315124. 

The presence of the carbonyl group and the nitrogen atoms in the ring suggests that the property value might be slightly negative, as seen in other nitrogen-containing heterocycles and carbonyl-containing compounds in the examples.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be around -0.35.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)(O)), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, which has a property value of 0.70896443.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is present in several molecules with varying property values.
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1), which is a saturated nitrogen-containing ring.

The presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a positive contribution to the property value, as seen in the example with a similar group. The amide linkage and piperidine ring are common in molecules with moderate property values.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, the predicted property value for CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is likely to be moderately positive. A reasonable estimate for the property value would be around 0.6.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.3681686891265001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (n-octane), we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The examples suggest that aliphatic hydrocarbons, particularly linear alkanes, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the property values for similar linear alkanes like CCCCCC (hexane) and CCCCCCCO (heptanol) are -0.49274029 and -0.55126391, respectively.

Given that CCCCCCCC is a longer linear alkane than those examples, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and likely slightly more negative than hexane due to the increased chain length. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (n-octane) would be approximately -0.6.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as the presence of functional groups, the degree of saturation, aromaticity, and overall molecular complexity. The examples provided suggest that the property values are influenced by these structural features.

The molecule in question, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, contains several notable features:
- It has a polycyclic structure with multiple rings, which often contributes to a higher property value.
- There is a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbonyl group (C=O), both of which can influence the property value.
- The presence of a triple bond (C#C) adds to the unsaturation and may affect the property value.

Based on the examples, molecules with complex polycyclic structures and functional groups like carbonyls and hydroxyls tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO has a property value of 1.99852065, which is quite high due to its complexity and functional groups.

Considering these factors, I would predict that the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is likely to be relatively high. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around 1.8.

Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 requires analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. This molecule appears to be a polycyclic compound with multiple ether and hydroxyl groups, similar to some of the more complex structures in the examples.

Given the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (methoxy, hydroxyl, and ether linkages) and the polycyclic aromatic structure, the molecule is likely to have a relatively high property value, similar to other complex polycyclic structures with multiple functional groups.

Based on the examples, particularly those with high property values like C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21 (2.70021335) and CC(C)C(Nc1ccc(cc1Cl)C(F)(F)F)C(=O)OC(C#N)c2cccc(Oc3ccccc3)c2 (3.01533067), the predicted property value for this molecule is likely to be in the higher range.

Therefore, I would predict the property value for COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 to be approximately 2.5.

- Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (a nitrophenol) with a property value of -0.53485491.
- Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) with a property value of -0.85981686.
- Clc1ccccc1I (iodobenzene) with a property value of -0.16921636.

The presence of a chlorine atom generally tends to increase the property value compared to fluorine, as seen in the examples. However, the presence of a hydroxyl group (as in phenol) tends to decrease the property value, as seen in the nitrophenol example.

Considering these factors, the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is likely to be between the values for phenol derivatives and chlorobenzene derivatives. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around -0.5. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is approximately -0.5.

- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1), which is similar to some of the examples provided and tends to increase the property value due to the presence of chlorine atoms.

Comparing with similar structures:
- Molecules with chlorinated aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (1.49340948) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (1.29869349), have relatively high property values.

Considering these factors, the presence of both polar functional groups and chlorinated aromatic rings suggests a property value that is likely positive and moderate. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around 0.3 to 0.5.

Let's choose a specific value within this range: 0.35.

- The presence of heterocyclic rings like pyrimidine can also contribute to a positive property value, as seen in some examples with nitrogen-containing rings.

Considering these observations, the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl has multiple aromatic rings, chlorine substituents, and a pyrimidine ring, which are features associated with positive property values in the examples.

Therefore, I would predict a positive property value for this molecule, likely in the range of 1.0 to 1.5. A reasonable specific prediction could be around 1.2.

The structure of CCCCCOC=O is similar to CCCCCCC=O, but with one fewer carbon in the chain. The presence of the ester functional group (OC=O) is a key feature, and the overall structure is a simple linear chain with an ester group, which tends to have negative property values in the examples provided.

Given the similarity to CCCCCCC=O and considering the trend that longer carbon chains with similar functional groups tend to have slightly less negative values, I would predict that CCCCCOC=O will have a property value slightly more negative than -0.71189489, but not as negative as the shorter chain CCCCC=O, which is -0.71189489.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be approximately -0.730.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is 2-methyl-1-butene, which is a small, branched alkene. In the examples, small alkanes and alkenes tend to have negative property values. For instance, the linear alkene CCCCCCCCC=C has a property value of -0.01293831, and the linear alkane CCCCCCCC has a property value of -0.36816869. The presence of a double bond and branching in CC=C(C)C might slightly increase the property value compared to a straight-chain alkane of similar size.

Considering these factors, the property value for CC=C(C)C is likely to be slightly negative, similar to other small hydrocarbons. A reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around -0.1.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -1.241747806978088
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane), we can analyze the trends in the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

In the examples, molecules with more complex structures and larger sizes tend to have higher property values, while smaller and simpler molecules, especially those with halogens, tend to have lower or negative values. For instance, ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of -0.7028781, and Oc1cccc(Cl)c1 has a value of -0.59876528. These examples suggest that the presence of chlorine atoms in relatively simple structures tends to result in negative property values.

Given that ClCCl is a small and simple molecule with two chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be approximately -0.7.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.20933329566492248
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol. In the examples, we have a similar structure: Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which is 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, with a property value of -0.2093333.

Given the structural similarity, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl will be very close to -0.2093333. Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is approximately -0.2093333.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 3.490993473916635
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known molecules.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, aromatic rings, and several hydroxyl groups. The presence of these functional groups and the overall complexity suggest that the molecule might have a relatively high property value, similar to other complex polycyclic structures in the examples.

Given the examples, particularly those with high property values like O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (2.16168954) and c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5cccc6c(c1)c2c3c4c56 (1.85858942), the molecule in question is likely to have a property value in a similar range.

Therefore, I would predict the property value for COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 to be approximately 1.9.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.3264893615479044
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A thiomethyl group (CS-)
- A pyrazole ring (1,2,4-triazole-like structure)
- A carbonyl group (=O)
- An amine group (N)
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of halogens (Cl, Br) often results in negative property values, unless they are part of a larger aromatic system.
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings or complex structures tend to have higher positive values.

The molecule in question has a heterocyclic aromatic ring with a carbonyl group and a tert-butyl group, which could contribute to a positive property value. However, the presence of sulfur and the relatively simple structure compared to some of the more complex examples might moderate this effect.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be around 0.5, as it shares some structural features with molecules like CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C, which has a property value of 0.64508515. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.23802767047961354
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ethyl benzoate, which is an ester formed from benzoic acid and ethanol. 

Looking at the examples, we have:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 with a property value of 1.80079647. This molecule is more complex due to the presence of additional functional groups like sulfonamide and a heterocyclic ring.
- CCCCCC(=O)OC with a property value of -0.48056762. This is a simple ester with a longer alkyl chain.
- CCCCC(=O)OCC with a property value of -0.48056762. This is another simple ester with a similar structure to the target molecule but with a longer alkyl chain.

The target molecule, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, is simpler than the first example and more similar to the last two examples, which are simple esters. Given the similarity in structure to CCCCC(=O)OCC, it is reasonable to predict a similar property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.48056762.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.23202295571749862
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached, making it a bromoalkane. In the examples, we have a similar structure, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which is a brominated aromatic compound with a property value of 0.12145847. However, CCCCCCCBr is a simpler, non-aromatic structure.

Looking at other linear alkyl chains in the examples:
- CCCCCCCCO has a property value of -0.49274029.
- CCCCCCC(=O)C has a property value of -0.53245302.

These examples suggest that linear alkyl chains without additional complex functional groups tend to have negative property values. The presence of a bromine atom, which is more electronegative than carbon, might slightly increase the property value compared to a simple alkane.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be slightly negative, similar to other linear alkyl chains, but possibly closer to zero due to the presence of bromine. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr is approximately:

-0.3

SMILES: CO
True Property: -1.5693914729171572
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for carbon monoxide (CO), we can analyze the examples provided and consider the structural and chemical characteristics of CO. The examples include a range of organic and inorganic molecules with varying complexity, functional groups, and molecular weights. 

Carbon monoxide is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is a small, non-polar molecule with no additional functional groups or complex structures. In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules, especially those with fewer functional groups and lower molecular weights, tend to have more negative property values. For instance, simple hydrocarbons like CCC (propane) have a property value of -1.26537801, and CC#C (propyne) has a value of -1.32204386.

Given the simplicity and small size of CO, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would be in the negative range, similar to other small, simple molecules. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO would be approximately -1.3.
