Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a cyclic compound with a structure similar to that of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of 2.10974558. The main difference is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) attached to the cyclic structure.

The presence of additional alkyl groups generally increases the hydrophobicity and can influence the property value. However, the examples suggest that the property values are not solely determined by hydrophobicity but also by the presence of specific functional groups and overall molecular structure.

Given the similarity to the example with a property value of 2.10974558 and considering the potential influence of the additional alkyl chain, the predicted property value for O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is likely to be slightly higher than 2.10974558.

In the examples, aromatic compounds with halogen substituents, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1 and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1, have a property value of -0.09270983. These examples suggest that the presence of halogen atoms on an aromatic ring tends to result in a similar property value.

Given that trifluoromethyl is a strong electron-withdrawing group and considering the examples with halogenated aromatic compounds, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 will be similar to those examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is -0.09270983.

True Property: 3.224553167474091
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)O) attached to an aromatic ring, which also has a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) as substituents. This structure is somewhat similar to the examples with phosphorothioate groups and aromatic rings, such as:

- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, with a property value of -1.38003182
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, with a property value of -1.38003182
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, with a property value of -1.38003182

These examples have halogen substituents on the aromatic ring, which are electron-withdrawing groups. In contrast, the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has a thiomethyl group, which is less electron-withdrawing compared to halogens, and a methyl group, which is electron-donating.

Given the structural similarity to the examples with phosphorothioate groups and the presence of less electron-withdrawing substituents, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be similar to those examples but slightly less negative due to the presence of the electron-donating methyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is approximately -1.38003182, slightly adjusted for the less electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents. However, without exact calculations or more specific data, the prediction remains an approximation.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to the end. 

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.09270983. Additionally, simple aliphatic chains like CCC have a property value of 0.0.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.09270983452046574
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and structural features. Molecules with halogens, particularly chlorines, often have negative or near-zero property values, especially when they are aromatic or have simple structures. 

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is a simple alkene with two chlorine atoms attached to the double-bonded carbons. This structure is relatively simple and does not have complex functional groups or aromatic systems that might significantly alter the property value.

Given the examples, particularly those with chlorinated aromatic systems or simple chlorinated alkenes, the property value for Cl\C=C/Cl is likely to be close to zero or slightly negative. 

Therefore, I predict the property value for Cl\C=C/Cl to be approximately -0.09270983.

SMILES: OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23
True Property: 2.822496293632006
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- An ester group (COC(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)
- An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23)
- A pyridine-like structure (ccnc)
- A chlorine substituent on an aromatic ring

From the examples, we observe:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents often have negative or near-zero property values, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1 (-0.09270983) and Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (-0.09270983).
- Molecules with ester groups and aromatic rings can have positive values, such as CCCOC(=O)CC (2.35770279) and CC(=O)c1ccccc1 (3.85648129).
- Molecules with amide linkages and aromatic rings can have negative values, such as O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 (-0.09270983).

Considering these observations, the presence of both an ester and an amide linkage, along with the aromatic and halogenated features, suggests a balance between positive and negative influences on the property value. The presence of the ester and aromatic rings might contribute to a positive value, while the amide and halogenated aromatic rings might contribute to a negative or near-zero value.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 would be slightly positive, but not as high as the purely ester-aromatic examples. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.5.

Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a terminal hydroxyl group, making it a primary alcohol (1-pentanol).

From the examples, we can observe that simple linear alkanes and alcohols tend to have property values around 0.0. For instance, OC1CCCCCCC1 (a cyclic alcohol) has a property value of 0.0, and CCCCCC (a linear alkane) would likely have a similar value if it were listed. Additionally, simple halogenated alkanes like CCC(C)Cl also have a property value of 0.0.

Given this pattern, it is reasonable to predict that CCCCCO, being a simple linear alcohol, would also have a property value close to 0.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCO is 0.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is often associated with polar and electron-withdrawing characteristics.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is also polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which is common in many of the examples with a property value of around -0.09270983.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can contribute to polarity.

From the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and polar functional groups like nitro, amide, or sulfonyl groups tend to have property values around -0.09270983. Given the presence of these groups in the molecule, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be similar to those examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is approximately -0.09270983.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several functional groups and structural features that can influence its property value:

1. **Ester Groups**: The presence of ester groups (COC(=O)) is a common feature in several molecules with positive property values, such as CCCCCC(=O)OC (2.35770279) and CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC (3.64730687).

2. **Nitro Group**: The nitro group (N(=O)=O) is present in molecules with both positive and negative property values. For example, CCCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a positive value (0.37961624), while Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a positive value (3.40264009).

3. **Aromatic Ring**: The presence of an aromatic ring is common in many molecules with both positive and negative property values. However, the combination of aromatic rings with other functional groups like esters and nitro groups tends to result in positive values.

4. **Overall Structure**: The molecule has a complex structure with multiple functional groups that are typically associated with positive property values.

Considering these factors and comparing with the examples, the molecule COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C is likely to have a positive property value. Given the presence of ester groups and the nitro group, a reasonable prediction would be a value similar to other ester-containing molecules with positive values.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule is approximately:

In the examples, small, non-polar molecules like CCCCC and CCC(C)(C)CC have a property value of 0.0. However, molecules with chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccccc1 and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, tend to have property values around -0.09270983. This suggests that the presence of chlorine might slightly decrease the property value compared to non-chlorinated hydrocarbons.

Given this pattern, it is reasonable to predict that ClCC would have a property value similar to other chlorinated compounds, likely around -0.09270983. Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCC is:

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings and nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.09270983. Additionally, molecules with methoxy groups attached to aromatic rings, such as COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC, have a property value of 0.68041532.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of both the methoxy and nitro groups, the property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is likely to be influenced by the presence of the nitro group, which tends to lower the property value.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, which is similar in nature to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 0.0. Both molecules are heavily chlorinated and lack functional groups that would significantly alter their electronic properties, such as nitro groups or carbonyls, which are present in other examples with non-zero property values.

Given the similarity in structure and the absence of functional groups that would suggest a deviation from the property value of 0.0, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is also 0.0.

Additionally, the presence of a triple bond in N#Cc1ccccc1C#N, which is a dicyano compound, has a property value of -0.09270983.

Considering the simplicity of the structure and the presence of a terminal alkyne, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CCC#C would be similar to those of simple hydrocarbons or slightly influenced by the presence of the triple bond.

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 3.744202980887865
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbonyl group (C=O), as well as an alkyne group (C#C). The presence of these functional groups and the overall structure can influence the property value.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with polycyclic structures and carbonyl groups, such as CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, have property values around 1.9.
- The presence of a hydroxyl group (O) in a polycyclic structure, as seen in CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, contributes to a property value of 1.91653536.
- The addition of an alkyne group (C#C) is not directly represented in the examples, but it can be considered to slightly increase the property value due to its influence on molecular polarity and potential interactions.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is likely to be slightly higher than 1.91653536 due to the additional alkyne group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately:

True Property: -0.2709121252514741
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule based on the examples provided involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, aromatic systems, and possibly the overall molecular complexity or size.

The given molecule, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, appears to be a complex structure with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and possibly a sugar-like moiety. This complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups suggest that the property value might be influenced by these features.

Based on the examples, molecules with complex structures and multiple functional groups, especially those with oxygen atoms, tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O has a property value of 0.0, while more complex structures with additional functional groups or aromatic systems have higher values.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be positive and relatively high due to its complexity and functional group content. A reasonable prediction, based on the trend observed in the examples, would be around 3.0. However, without a precise model or additional context, this remains an estimation.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 is approximately:

True Property: -1.4973570159207048
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of a sulfur atom and a tert-butyl group suggests that the molecule might have a property value that is influenced by these features.

Looking at the examples, we notice that molecules with similar heterocyclic structures and functional groups tend to have negative property values, especially when they contain nitrogen and sulfur atoms in a heterocyclic ring. For instance, the molecule CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a property value of 1.71219525, but it also contains an additional oxygen and a more complex structure.

Given the presence of the thiosemicarbazide moiety and the tert-butyl group, the property value is likely to be negative, but not as low as those with multiple halogens or highly aromatic systems. Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be around -0.5.

Based on the examples provided, the property values seem to be influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecules. The molecule in question, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, is an ethyl benzoate, which is an ester derived from benzoic acid and ethanol.

Looking at the examples, esters like CCCCCC(=O)OC and CCCCC(=O)OCC have property values of 1.11974769. The presence of the ester functional group (C(=O)OC) in these examples seems to contribute to a positive property value. Additionally, the aromatic ring (c1ccccc1) in the molecule is similar to other aromatic compounds in the examples, which often have property values around -0.09270983, but the ester functionality seems to dominate the property value.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is likely to be similar to the other esters provided. Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately:

True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached to the end. In the examples, linear alkyl chains such as CCCCCCCCO have a property value of 0.0. The presence of a halogen, such as bromine, might slightly alter this value, but in the examples, aromatic compounds with halogens like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 have a property value of -0.09270983, which is close to 0.0.

Considering the linear nature of the alkyl chain and the presence of a single bromine atom, the property value is likely to be close to 0.0, with a slight negative shift due to the bromine. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be approximately -0.09270983.
