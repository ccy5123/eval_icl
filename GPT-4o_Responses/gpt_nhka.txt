SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.36534916138315576
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the patterns and trends from the given examples. The molecule in question is a linear aliphatic ester, specifically a decanoate ester.

From the examples, we observe that:

1. Linear aliphatic alcohols and esters tend to have positive property values. For instance:
   - CCCCCCC(C)O has a property value of 0.82437759.
   - CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of 0.36534916.

2. The property value for esters seems to be lower than that for alcohols, likely due to the presence of the carbonyl group, which introduces some degree of polarity and potential for negative interactions.

Given that CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a longer chain ester than CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can expect its property value to be slightly higher due to increased hydrophobic interactions from the longer carbon chain, but still within the range of esters.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be slightly higher than 0.36534916, but still positive. A predicted value could be around 0.4.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.2810378164485809
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a lactam (cyclic amide) structure. It resembles some of the aromatic and heterocyclic compounds in the examples, particularly those with nitrogen and oxygen heteroatoms and chlorine substituents.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with chlorine substituents, such as Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, tend to have higher property values.
- Compounds with nitrogen heteroatoms, such as c1cncnc1, have lower property values.
- The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) in cyclic structures, such as O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1, tends to lower the property value.

Considering these observations, the presence of both chlorine and a lactam structure in Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 suggests a balance between the increasing effect of chlorine and the decreasing effect of the lactam. The molecule is likely to have a property value that is not extremely high or low, but rather moderate.

Based on the structural analysis and comparison with similar compounds, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is approximately -0.1.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.2997736708784867
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an isopropyl group (CC(C)). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have negative property values. This suggests that the presence of a nitro group tends to lower the property value.

Additionally, the examples show that small hydrocarbons like CCC(C)CC have positive property values, but the presence of electronegative or electron-withdrawing groups like nitro tends to decrease the property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative, similar to other nitro-containing compounds in the examples. A reasonable estimate, based on the trend observed, would be around -0.5. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.5.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO

This molecule is a polycyclic compound with multiple rings and carbonyl groups. It resembles some of the complex polycyclic structures in the examples, such as:

- Cc1cc2c3ccccc3ccc2c4ccccc14, with a property value of -1.33024566
- C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13, with a property value of -1.08667956
- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC, with a property value of -0.44029258

The presence of carbonyl groups and the polycyclic nature suggest that the property value might be negative, as seen in similar structures. However, the specific arrangement and functional groups can influence the exact value.

Considering the complexity and the presence of carbonyl groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.5 to -1.0. Given the examples, a more precise estimate would be:

-0.44029258

This value aligns with the presence of carbonyl groups and the polycyclic structure, similar to the example with a known property value of -0.44029258.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A difluorobenzene moiety (Fc1cccc(F)c1), which is similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 with a property value of -0.06557549.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N), which is a common feature in several molecules with varying property values.
- A chlorobenzene moiety (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), which is similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 0.67449076.

The presence of both electron-withdrawing groups (fluorine and chlorine) and the amide linkage suggests a balance between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects. The examples with similar features tend to have property values around the range of -0.1 to 0.7.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 is approximately 0.1.

SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: 0.8243775949158385
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with a linear chain and a branching methyl group. 

Looking at the examples, we notice that simple linear and branched alkanes and ethers tend to have positive property values. For instance, CCCCCCC(O)CC has a property value of 0.82437759, and CCC1(CCC(=O)NC1=O)c2ccccc2 has a property value of -0.67449076, which is slightly negative due to the presence of a carbonyl group and an aromatic ring.

Given that CCCOC(C)C is a relatively simple ether without any strongly electronegative atoms or aromatic rings, it is likely to have a positive property value similar to other simple ethers and alkanes. 

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C would be around 0.82437759, similar to other simple aliphatic ethers and alkanes in the examples.

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 0.07494341771962174
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Alkyl Chain**: The molecule has a propyl group (CCC(C)) attached to the pyrrole ring. Alkyl chains generally increase hydrophobicity, which can increase the property value.

2. **Pyrrole Ring**: The presence of a pyrrole ring, which is a five-membered aromatic heterocycle, can contribute to aromaticity and potential electron delocalization.

3. **Carbonyl Groups**: The molecule has two carbonyl groups (C=O), which are polar and can decrease the property value due to increased hydrophilicity.

4. **Bromine Atom**: The presence of a bromine atom (Br) can increase the property value due to its size and polarizability, which can enhance hydrophobic interactions.

Comparing with the examples:

- Molecules with halogens like Cl or Br tend to have higher property values, as seen in examples like Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (1.03047199) and CCCCCCCBr (1.31150981).
- Molecules with carbonyl groups tend to have lower property values, as seen in examples like CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (0.08431134).

Considering these factors, the presence of both hydrophobic (alkyl chain, bromine) and hydrophilic (carbonyl groups) features suggests a balance between increasing and decreasing the property value. However, the presence of two carbonyl groups might have a more significant impact in reducing the property value compared to the single bromine atom's effect in increasing it.

Based on this analysis, the predicted property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O is likely to be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the carbonyl groups.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule, c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, is biphenyl, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. This structure is similar to the first example, Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1, which is a naphthalene derivative with a property value of -0.84311345. However, biphenyl is a simpler structure with only two phenyl rings and no additional substituents or fused rings.

Considering the examples, simpler aromatic hydrocarbons like C1CCc2ccccc2C1 (a cyclohexylbenzene) have a property value of 0.13115098. Biphenyl is more similar to this example in terms of aromatic content and lack of additional functional groups.

Therefore, based on the structural similarity to simpler aromatic hydrocarbons and the lack of additional functional groups, the predicted property value for biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) is likely to be close to 0.13115098. However, given that biphenyl is slightly more complex than a single benzene ring but less complex than the naphthalene derivative, a reasonable prediction would be slightly lower than 0.13115098, but not as low as -0.84311345.

Thus, a reasonable predicted property value for biphenyl could be approximately 0.0.

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 1.1897267562989942
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and shape of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a sulfur atom at the end. This structure is similar to the linear alkanes and alkenes in the examples, such as CCCCCCC=C (0.6182832) and CCCCCCC(C)C (0.8618493). The presence of sulfur, which is less electronegative than oxygen and nitrogen, might slightly alter the property value compared to a simple alkane.

Considering the examples and the structure of CCCCCS, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around the values for similar linear hydrocarbons. Therefore, I would predict the property value for CCCCCS to be approximately 0.6182832.

Looking at the examples:
- CCC(C)(C)C has a property value of 0.8618493.
- CCCC(C)(O)CC has a property value of 0.82437759.
- CC(C)CC(C)O has a property value of 0.82437759.

These examples suggest that branched alkanes and alcohols tend to have positive property values around 0.8 to 0.86. Given that CCCC(C)(C)CO is a similar structure, it is reasonable to predict a property value in this range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is approximately 0.82437759.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a property value of -0.84311345.
- Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (another naphthalene derivative) has a property value of -0.35598123.

The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is similar to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, which is also a naphthalene derivative. Given the structural similarity, we can expect the property value to be close to that of Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately -0.35598123.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic imide, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -0.68385869. The main difference is the substitution of a (C(C)CCC) group instead of a (C) group. This substitution introduces additional alkyl chains, which generally increase hydrophobicity and might slightly increase the property value due to increased non-polar character.

Considering the structural similarity and the effect of the additional alkyl chain, the predicted property value for O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be slightly higher than -0.68385869. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.65.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group is known to be electron-withdrawing due to the high electronegativity of fluorine atoms. This can influence the molecule's properties, such as its polarity and reactivity.

Looking at the examples, molecules with halogen substituents on aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1 and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, have positive property values (1.08667956 and 1.03047199, respectively). These examples suggest that halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values.

Given the electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group and the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 will also have a positive property value. However, the exact value will depend on the specific influence of the trifluoromethyl group compared to other halogens.

Based on the examples and the structural considerations, I would predict a property value of approximately 1.0 for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a property value of 0.63701905. This suggests that the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups contributes positively to the property value.

Given that OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is similar in structure to the example with a property value of 0.63701905, we can predict that the property value for this molecule will be close to this value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately 0.63701905.

This molecule is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Presence of Ketone Groups**: The molecule contains multiple ketone groups (C=O), which are polar and can influence the property value. In the examples, molecules with ketone groups tend to have negative property values, such as:
   - CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCCCC2, with a property value of -0.68385869.
   - CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, with a property value of -0.73069832.

2. **Presence of Ester Group**: The ester group (CC(=O)O) is also present, which can contribute to a more negative property value due to its polar nature. In the examples, esters like CCOC(=O)C have a property value of 0.36534916, but this is a simpler structure.

3. **Complex Cyclic Structure**: The molecule has a complex polycyclic structure, similar to some of the examples with negative property values, such as:
   - CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, with a property value of -0.18735854.

4. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (C3(O) and C(O)) can also influence the property value, potentially making it more negative due to increased polarity.

Considering these factors, the molecule's complex structure, multiple ketone and ester groups, and hydroxyl groups suggest a negative property value. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.5 to -0.7.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C is approximately:

Both molecules have multiple fused rings and an oxygen-containing functional group.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of multiple cyclohexane rings and a ketone group, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O would be close to that of the similar example.

Looking at the examples:
- O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.43092465.
- O=N(=O)c1cccc2ccccc12 has a property value of -0.91805687.
- COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.6182832.

These examples suggest that the presence of a nitro group on an aromatic ring tends to result in a negative property value. The molecule in question also has an acetamide group (CC(=O)N), which is less influential compared to the nitro group but still contributes to the overall property.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative and in the range of the examples with nitro groups on aromatic rings. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.5 to -0.7.

- Chlorinated aromatic compounds like Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl have a property value of -0.05620756.
- Compounds with sulfur linkages like CSSC have a high positive value of 1.51760421, but this is a disulfide, which is different from a thioether.
- Compounds with carbonyls and esters, such as CCC(=O)OC, have a property value of 0.36534916.

Considering these observations, the presence of a chlorine-substituted aromatic ring and the phosphorothioate group might suggest a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero, as seen in some of the chlorinated aromatic compounds and carbonyl-containing compounds.

Given the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for triphenylene (C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13) will also be negative and likely in a similar range to other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 is approximately -1.3.

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -0.7869058860560272
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N), which is often associated with polar and electron-withdrawing characteristics.
- An aromatic ring (phenyl group) with an amine substituent, which can contribute to electron-donating effects.
- A guanidine group (NC(=N)N), which is highly polar and basic.

From the examples, molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (N(=O)=O) and halogens (Cl, Br) tend to have more positive property values, while those with electron-donating groups or more complex aromatic systems tend to have more negative values.

Given the presence of both electron-withdrawing (sulfonamide) and electron-donating (amine) groups, along with the polar guanidine group, the property value is likely to be negative, reflecting the overall polar and potentially electron-donating nature of the molecule.

Based on these considerations and the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 would be around -0.5.

SMILES: CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.6206514081868193
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several molecules with negative property values.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) attached to the aromatic ring, which can also contribute to a negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
- An alkylamine group (CCN(CC(C)=C)), which is present in some molecules with slightly negative or near-zero property values.

Based on the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O and Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O, have negative property values.
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro and trifluoromethyl tends to lower the property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative. Given the strong electron-withdrawing effects and the structural similarity to other molecules with negative values, a reasonable prediction would be around -1.0 to -1.5.

Therefore, the predicted specific property value is approximately -1.2.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.36534916138315576
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. In the examples, we have several esters and similar structures:

1. CC(C)CCOC=O (0.36534916)
2. CCCCCOC(=O)C (0.36534916)
3. CCC(C)(C)O (0.82437759)
4. CC(=O)N (0.36534916)

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is structurally similar to CC(C)CCOC=O and CCCCCOC(=O)C, both of which have a property value of 0.36534916. The presence of the ester functional group and the small alkyl chain suggests that the property value should be similar to these examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O is approximately 0.36534916.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.0562075632897162
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples.

Looking at the examples, we see that simple aromatic compounds with hydroxyl groups, such as phenol (c1ccccc1O), have a property value of -0.05620756. The presence of additional methyl groups, as in Cc1cccc(C)c1 (toluene), also has a property value of -0.05620756.

Given that Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a combination of these features (a phenol with an additional methyl group), it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar to these examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is approximately -0.05620756.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate groups in the examples with high property values (e.g., COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl with a property value of 1.47076457 and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl with a property value of 1.70496275). These examples suggest that the presence of the phosphorothioate group contributes significantly to a higher property value.

Additionally, the molecule has a methoxy group (OC) and a thiomethyl group (SC) attached to the aromatic ring. The presence of these groups, along with the methyl group (C), can influence the property value, but the phosphorothioate group is likely the dominant factor.

Considering the structural similarities to the examples with high property values, particularly the presence of the phosphorothioate group, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be in the higher range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 1.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we can observe that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have higher property values. For instance:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1.03047199.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1.30214188.
- ClC(Cl)Cl has a property value of 1.67685897.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is similar to these examples, with multiple chlorine atoms attached to an aromatic system. Given the trend that more chlorination tends to increase the property value, and considering the structure of the molecule, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is relatively high, similar to the examples with multiple chlorines.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 1.30214188, as it is similar in structure to the example with a similar level of chlorination.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.2997736708784867
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group attached to the terminal carbon. The presence of the nitro group (N(=O)=O) is a significant factor, as it is known to be an electron-withdrawing group, which generally contributes to a more negative property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, have negative property values. The presence of multiple nitro groups tends to make the property value more negative.

Given that CCCN(=O)=O has a single nitro group and a relatively simple structure, we can expect its property value to be negative, but not as negative as those with multiple nitro groups or additional electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around -0.5.

True Property: 0.5152359968223991
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, which can be compared to similar structures in the examples.

1. **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1** has a property value of 0.85248138. This molecule is a chlorobenzene with a bromine substituent.
2. **c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12** has a property value of 0.09367927. This is a biphenyl structure with a bromine substituent.

The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, F) generally increases the property value, as seen in the examples. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which might slightly increase the property value compared to chlorobenzene with bromine.

Considering these factors, the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is likely to be slightly higher than that of Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 due to the presence of fluorine. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be around 0.9.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. This molecule is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group, similar to some of the examples given.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar structural features, such as cyclic structures and alcohol groups, tend to have property values around 0.8. For instance, CCC(C)(C)O and CC1CCCO1 both have property values of 0.82437759. These examples suggest that the presence of a tertiary alcohol group and a cyclic structure contribute to a positive property value.

Given the structural similarities, I would predict that the property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is approximately 0.82437759.

True Property: -0.14051890822429056
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), an amide linkage, and a phenyl ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 0.45902843. The main difference is the presence of a thioether linkage (SC) in the example, which is replaced by an amide linkage in the target molecule.

The presence of the amide group, which is generally more polar than a thioether, might slightly decrease the property value due to increased polarity and potential hydrogen bonding. However, the overall structural similarity suggests that the property value will be in a similar range.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be slightly lower than 0.45902843, but still positive. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.35.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzamide structure with an additional methyl group on the nitrogen. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of -1.40518908. Both molecules contain a benzene ring and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, but the example molecule is more complex with additional aromatic rings and a ketone group.

Given the structural similarities and the presence of aromatic and heterocyclic components, we can infer that the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is likely to be in the negative range, similar to other aromatic and heterocyclic compounds in the examples.

Considering the complexity and the presence of the carbonyl group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around -1.2. This is slightly less negative than the example with a more complex structure, reflecting the simpler nature of the molecule in question.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.36534916138315576

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which is a linear chain with a total of 9 carbon atoms.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCC, a linear alkane with 5 carbon atoms, has a property value of 0.8618493.
- CCCCCCCCI, a linear alkane with 8 carbon atoms and an iodine atom, has a property value of 1.54570799.
- CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, a linear ester with 10 carbon atoms, has a property value of 0.36534916.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar to the last example, CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, but with one less carbon in the chain. The property value for the 10-carbon ester is 0.36534916. Given that the property values for similar linear esters and alkanes tend to decrease slightly with shorter chain lengths, we can predict that the property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC will be slightly higher than 0.36534916 but still in the same range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 0.36534916.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is methyl benzoate, which is an ester derived from benzoic acid.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Esters like CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 have a property value of -0.36534916.
- Aromatic compounds with ester groups tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of an aromatic ring (phenyl group) and an ester functional group in the molecule suggests a property value similar to other aromatic esters.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is likely to be close to -0.36534916. Therefore, the predicted specific property value for methyl benzoate is:

-0.36534916

True Property: 0.3747170885981085
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and structural features.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, also known as 1,3-butadiene. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons and alkenes tend to have positive property values. For instance, CC/C=C/C (a linear alkene) has a property value of 0.6182832, and CCC(C)(C)CC (a branched alkane) has a property value of 0.8618493.

Given that C=CCC=C is a simple linear diene, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value, likely in the range of other simple hydrocarbons and alkenes. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C would be around 0.6 to 0.8.

Therefore, the predicted property value for C=CCC=C is approximately 0.7.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular size and complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is tribromomethane, also known as bromoform. It is a small, simple molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples provided, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly bromine, tend to have positive property values. For instance, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of 0.09367927, and FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br has a property value of 1.38645323.

Given that BrC(Br)Br is a small molecule with three bromine atoms, it is likely to have a positive property value. However, it is less complex than the other bromine-containing examples, which might result in a lower positive value.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around 1.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 0.76817003.
- An amide linkage (N-C=O) within a cyclic structure, similar to the example CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O, which has a property value of -0.13115098.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is a feature in several examples with positive property values, such as ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl (1.70496275) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (1.21783054).

Considering these features, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the chlorinated carbon suggests a positive contribution to the property value. However, the cyclic amide structure might slightly reduce the overall value, as seen in some examples with similar features.

Balancing these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is likely to be moderately positive. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A dimethylamino group (CN(C)C(=O)), which is similar to the structure in CN(C)C(=O)C, which has a property value of 0.36534916.
- A chloro-substituted aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of -0.15925476.
- A heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen, similar to structures like Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2, which has a property value of -0.74943418.
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C), which is a bulky group that can influence the property value.

Considering these features and the examples provided, the molecule has a mix of electron-withdrawing groups (like the chloro and nitro groups) and electron-donating groups (like the dimethylamino group). The presence of the heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen also suggests a more negative property value.

Based on these considerations and the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be around -0.5. This accounts for the electron-withdrawing effects and the structural complexity of the molecule.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with chlorine atoms attached to each ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a property value of 0.48713222. However, the presence of an additional phenyl ring and ether linkage in the target molecule could influence the property value.

Another relevant example is Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -0.05620756. This molecule also contains two phenyl rings with chlorine substituents, but without the ether linkage.

Considering these examples, the ether linkage in the target molecule might slightly increase the property value compared to Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2, but it is unlikely to reach the value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl due to the additional complexity and potential for electron delocalization across the biphenyl ether structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the additional phenyl ring and ether linkage. A predicted value could be around -0.1.

The molecule CC/C=C\C is a linear alkene with four carbon atoms, similar to the example CC/C=C/C, which has a property value of 0.6182832.

Given the structural similarity, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC/C=C\C will be very close to that of CC/C=C/C. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C is approximately 0.6182832.

SMILES: CCCOCC
True Property: 0.8243775949158385
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCOCC is a linear chain of carbon atoms with an ether functional group (an oxygen atom connecting two carbon chains).

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with simple linear or branched alkanes, such as C (0.8618493), CCC(O)CC (0.82437759), and C1CCCCCC1 (0.8618493), tend to have positive property values.
- Molecules with ether groups, such as CC(C)COC(=O)C (0.36534916) and CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (-0.36534916), show a range of property values, but the presence of additional functional groups like carbonyls or aromatic rings can influence the value significantly.

Given that CCCOCC is a simple ether without additional complex functional groups, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is positive but potentially lower than those of simple alkanes due to the presence of the ether group.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be around 0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a tertiary amide with two phenyl rings and a tert-butyl group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of -1.38645323. Both molecules contain amide linkages and phenyl rings, which contribute to their electronic properties.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of the amide group and phenyl rings, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 will also be negative and in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is approximately -1.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-), which is a polar functional group.
- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1), which is similar to the structure of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 with a property value of 0.515236.

The presence of the acetamide group introduces polarity and potential hydrogen bonding, which could lower the property value compared to a simple bromobenzene. However, the bromine atom contributes to the property value due to its electronegativity and size.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be slightly lower than that of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 due to the additional polar acetamide group. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.3.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with alkyl chains or alcohol groups, such as CC(C)CO, CCCCC(O)CC, and CC(C)CCO, tend to have higher property values around 0.82437759.
- Molecules with aromatic rings and additional substituents, such as Cc1ccccc1N and Cc1cccc2ccccc12, tend to have lower or negative property values.
- The presence of a benzene ring with alkyl substituents, as seen in CCc1ccc(C)cc1 and CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1, results in property values around 0.13115098.

Given that CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is similar in structure to CCc1ccc(C)cc1 and CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1, both of which have property values of 0.13115098, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 will be similar.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.1779906170841014
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with benzene rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro groups) tend to have more negative property values.
- Molecules with halogens attached to benzene rings tend to have positive property values.
- Simple hydrocarbons or those with alkyl groups tend to have positive property values.

Benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, attached to a benzene ring. This is somewhat similar to the molecule NC(=O)c1ccccc1O, which has a property value of -0.55270771. However, benzaldehyde is less complex and has fewer electron-withdrawing groups than some of the more negative examples.

Considering these factors, benzaldehyde is likely to have a negative property value, but not as negative as molecules with multiple electron-withdrawing groups. A reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 would be around -0.3.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -1.6768589714765347
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with negative property values.
- An aromatic ring with a heteroatom (oxygen), similar to some examples with negative property values.
- A cyclic urea structure (O=C2CN...C(=O)N2), which is not directly present in the examples but can be considered similar to amide or lactam structures, often associated with negative property values.

Based on these observations and the trends in the examples, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value. Considering the structural complexity and the presence of electron-withdrawing groups, a reasonable prediction would be a property value around -1.0 to -1.5.

Therefore, a specific predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 could be approximately -1.2.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.9742644303550811
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diarylamine, specifically a diphenylamine derivative, which is similar to the example N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 with a property value of -0.97426443. The key difference is that the example has a diazo group (N=N) connecting the two phenyl rings, whereas the target molecule has an amine group (N-N).

The presence of the amine group instead of the diazo group could potentially make the molecule less electron-withdrawing and slightly less negative in property value compared to the diazo compound. However, the overall aromatic character and the presence of two phenyl rings remain similar.

Considering these structural similarities and differences, the predicted property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would likely be slightly less negative than -0.97426443. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around -0.9.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has a similar structure to some of the examples provided, particularly the cyclic amide structures. Let's compare it to the example O=C1N(COC(=O)CC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of -2.08904777. This example has a more complex structure with additional aromatic rings, which likely contributes to its more negative property value.

Another example, C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1, has a property value of -0.31850953. This molecule is also a cyclic amide but with a simpler structure compared to the previous example.

The target molecule, O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, is structurally more similar to the second example, as it is a simple cyclic dipeptide without additional aromatic or complex substituents.

Considering these comparisons, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be close to -0.31850953, but slightly more negative due to the presence of two carbonyl groups in a small ring, which might increase the electron-withdrawing effect. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.4.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have positive property values. For instance, Clc1ccccc1Cl has a property value of 0.67449076, and Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a property value of 0.7588021.
- The presence of additional chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in ClC(Br)Br with a property value of 2.03284021.

Given that Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has three chlorine atoms and a biphenyl structure, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. Considering the examples and the structural similarity to other chlorinated compounds, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.8 to 1.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately 0.9.

The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is similar to CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 in that it is an alkyl-substituted benzene, but with shorter alkyl chains. Given that the property value for CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 is 0.13115098, and considering the shorter alkyl chains in CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can expect a slightly lower property value due to the reduced hydrophobic character.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be slightly lower than 0.13115098, but still positive. A predicted value could be around 0.06557549, similar to the pyridine example, which also has a small alkyl group attached to an aromatic ring.

The sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is electron-withdrawing, similar to the nitro group (N(=O)=O), and both are para-substituted on an aniline ring.

Given the similarity in structure and the electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O will be in a similar range to the nitroaniline example. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is approximately -0.6182832.

In the examples, similar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 and c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54, have property values of -1.33024566 and -1.57381177, respectively.

Considering the structural similarity and the aromatic nature of the molecule, we can predict that the property value for c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 will be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately -1.5.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the more complex aromatic structures in the examples, particularly those with multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings, which tend to have negative property values.

For instance, the molecule Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 has a property value of -2.2014629, and it shares some structural similarities with the given molecule, such as the presence of multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups.

Considering these structural similarities and the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for the given molecule will also be negative and likely in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 is approximately -2.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)O)
- An amide linkage (NC(C)=O)
- A thioester linkage (SC)

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, have relatively high property values (1.29277396).
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1, have lower property values (-0.09367927).
- Molecules with thioester linkages are not directly present in the examples, but sulfur-containing groups like thiophosphates tend to have higher values.

Considering these observations, the presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a higher property value, while the amide linkage might lower it slightly. The overall structure is relatively simple compared to some of the more complex examples with high values.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around 0.5.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is a simple alkene with two chlorine atoms attached to the carbon-carbon double bond. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, tend to have higher property values. This suggests that the presence of chlorine atoms may increase the property value.

Given this pattern, and considering the simplicity of the molecule compared to more complex structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around 0.9. This is based on the trend that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have higher property values, and the simplicity of the structure suggests it would not reach the highest values seen in more complex chlorinated compounds.

- A chlorine atom attached to an aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(I)cc1 with a property value of 1.08667956.

Considering these structural features, the molecule has characteristics of both polar and non-polar groups, with a significant presence of aromatic and halogenated components. The presence of the amide and ether groups suggests a tendency towards a negative property value, as seen in similar structures.

Based on these observations and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 would be around -1.0. This accounts for the negative influence of the amide and ether groups, balanced by the presence of the aromatic and halogenated components.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 0.8243775949158385
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the trends and patterns from the given examples. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol with a five-carbon chain, also known as pentanol.

From the examples, we observe that:

1. Linear alkanes and alcohols tend to have positive property values. For instance, OC1CCCCCCC1 (a cyclic alcohol) has a property value of 0.82437759, and CCCCCC (a linear alkane) would likely have a similar positive value.

2. The presence of an alcohol group (OH) in a linear chain seems to contribute positively to the property value, as seen in OC1CCCCCCC1.

3. The property values for linear alkanes and alcohols are generally positive and increase with the length of the carbon chain.

Given these observations, CCCCCO, being a linear alcohol with a five-carbon chain, is expected to have a positive property value. Based on the trend, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be around 0.82437759, similar to other alcohols in the examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCO is approximately 0.82437759.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is a strong electron-withdrawing group.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is also electron-withdrawing.
- An aromatic ring (phenyl group), which can contribute to resonance stabilization.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which is relatively neutral but can affect solubility and polarity.

From the examples:
- Molecules with strong electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups (N(=O)=O), tend to have negative property values (e.g., Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, -0.99300028).
- Molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups, like amides, also tend to have negative property values (e.g., CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1, -0.43092465).

Considering these factors, the presence of both the sulfonyl and amide groups, along with the aromatic ring, suggests that the property value is likely to be negative. The combination of these features is similar to other molecules with negative values in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be around -0.5.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several functional groups and structural features that can influence its property value:

1. **Ester Groups (COC(=O))**: Esters are present in the molecule, which can contribute to a positive property value due to their electron-withdrawing nature.

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The presence of a nitro group is significant as it is a strong electron-withdrawing group, often associated with negative property values in the examples.

3. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: Aromatic rings are common in the examples and can contribute to both positive and negative property values depending on the substituents attached.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring (C1=C(C)NC)**: The presence of a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen can influence the property value, often seen in examples with negative values.

5. **Ketone Groups (C(=O))**: Ketones are also electron-withdrawing and can contribute to a negative property value.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, particularly those with nitro groups and aromatic rings, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value. The presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups (nitro, ester, ketone) suggests a more negative value.

Based on the analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -1.0, considering the influence of the nitro group and other electron-withdrawing groups.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two amide groups and a cyclohexane-like structure due to the cyclization of the peptide bond. This structure is relatively small and contains polar functional groups (carbonyl and amide), which can influence its property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with polar functional groups and cyclic structures, such as OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O (-1.1709909) and CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (-0.28103782), tend to have negative property values. However, the diketopiperazine structure is more compact and less aromatic than these examples, which might result in a less negative value.

Considering these factors, I would predict the property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 to be around -0.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure with a chlorine atom attached to a two-carbon chain. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons like CCCCC and CCC(C)(C)CC have positive property values around 0.8618493. The presence of a chlorine atom, as seen in Clc1ccccc1, results in a property value of 0.40282087, which is slightly lower than the hydrocarbons without chlorine.

Considering the simplicity of ClCC and the influence of the chlorine atom, we can predict that the property value for ClCC will be positive but lower than that of the simple hydrocarbons without chlorine. A reasonable estimate, based on the examples, would be around 0.4.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCC is approximately 0.4.

- Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 0.92742479.
- Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.21546233.

Given the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and the aromatic nature of the compound, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. Considering the examples, a value around 0.7588021 (similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl) seems appropriate.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is approximately 0.7588021.

- CCC(C)CCO has a property value of 0.82437759.
- CCC(CC)CO has a property value of 0.82437759.

These examples are all alcohols with similar carbon chain lengths and structures. The consistent property value for these alcohols suggests that the property value for CCCCC(C)O would be similar.

To predict the property value for the molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the given examples and their properties. The molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is 1,4-dibromobenzene, which is an aromatic compound with two bromine atoms attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values. For instance:
   - ClCCl (1,2-dichloroethane) has a property value of 1.40518908.
   - ClC(Cl)Cl (chloroform) has a property value of 1.67685897.
   - ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl (carbon tetrachloride) has a property value of 1.94852886.
   - CI (iodomethane) has a property value of 1.54570799.

2. The presence of multiple halogen atoms, especially heavier halogens like bromine, tends to increase the property value.

Given these observations, and considering that 1,4-dibromobenzene is a simple aromatic compound with two bromine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. The presence of two bromine atoms, which are heavier than chlorine, suggests a property value that is likely to be positive and potentially higher than those of similar chlorinated compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 (1,4-dibromobenzene) would be around 1.5 to 2.0. However, without exact calibration, a specific prediction could be:

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl has a similar structure but with fewer chlorine atoms compared to the example. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in the examples. Given that the structure is less chlorinated than the example with a value of 2.11715155, we can expect the property value to be slightly lower.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be around 2.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a triaryl phosphate ester, which includes:
- Aromatic rings (phenyl groups)
- Phosphate ester linkage

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro or carbonyl groups) tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with alkyl chains or less polar functional groups tend to have positive property values.

The given molecule has three aromatic rings and a phosphate group, which is somewhat polar but not as electron-withdrawing as nitro groups. The presence of methyl groups on the aromatic rings may slightly increase the property value compared to a similar structure without them.

Considering these factors, the property value for this molecule is likely to be slightly negative, as the polar phosphate group and multiple aromatic rings suggest a tendency towards a negative value, but not as strongly negative as molecules with more electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1 would be around -0.2.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: -0.018735854429905434
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to be electron-withdrawing.
- An aromatic ring, which is common in many of the examples.
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle, specifically a piperidine-like structure with a ketone group.

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (NO2) or trifluoromethyl (CF3) tend to have negative property values.
- Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing substituents also tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of halogens (Cl, F) can influence the property value, often making it more positive, but this depends on the overall structure.

Given these observations, the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O has a combination of electron-withdrawing groups and halogens, which suggests a balance between negative and positive influences. However, the presence of the trifluoromethyl group and the ketone in the heterocycle likely shifts the property value towards the negative side.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.5.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6182831961868788
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (CO) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) also attached to the ring.

From the examples, we can identify some relevant patterns:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, tend to have negative property values. The example given has a property value of -0.99300028.
- Molecules with methoxy groups attached to aromatic rings, such as COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC, have a negative property value of -0.8618493.

Considering these observations, the presence of both a methoxy group and a nitro group on the benzene ring suggests that the property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is likely to be negative. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.9, as the influence of the nitro group is quite significant in lowering the property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is approximately -0.9.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated compound, similar to ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 2.49186864. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in the examples with high chlorine content.

Given the high degree of chlorination and the structural complexity of the molecule, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be quite high, similar to the highly chlorinated example provided.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is approximately 2.49186864.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.36534916138315576
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with halogens, especially multiple halogens, tend to have higher property values.
- Molecules with nitro groups (NO2) or other electron-withdrawing groups tend to have lower property values.
- Simple hydrocarbons and alcohols tend to have positive property values.

The molecule CCCOC=O does not contain any halogens or nitro groups, and it is a relatively simple ester. Esters in the examples tend to have negative property values, but the presence of a simple alkyl chain (propyl group) might offset this slightly.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be slightly negative, but not as low as those with strong electron-withdrawing groups. A value around -0.1 to -0.3 seems plausible.

Therefore, I would predict the property value for CCCOC=O to be approximately -0.2.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: 0.36534916138315576
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a long-chain ester, specifically a decanoate ester, which is similar in structure to other aliphatic esters and alcohols in the examples.

Looking at the examples, we see that aliphatic esters and alcohols tend to have positive property values. For instance, CCCCOC has a property value of 0.82437759, and CCCCC(CC)C=O has a property value of 0.55270771. These examples suggest that the presence of an ester group in a relatively simple aliphatic chain tends to result in a positive property value.

Given the structure of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, which is a decanoate ester, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be positive and likely in a similar range to the other aliphatic esters and alcohols. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be approximately 0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to the aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, also tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of chlorine atoms in aromatic rings, as seen in Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, also contributes to negative property values.

Given these observations, the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O is likely to have a negative property value due to the combination of these functional groups.

Based on the trends from the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.15925476, similar to the example with a nitro group and chlorine-substituted aromatic ring.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to analyze its structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- Two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are similar to the phosphorothioate group in the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 0.76817003.
- Aromatic rings with ether linkages, similar to the structure in the example CC(C)(C)C(=O)C(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)n2cncn2 with a property value of -0.89932101.
- Sulfur linkages, which are present in the example CCSSCC with a property value of 1.51760421.

The presence of multiple phosphorothioate groups and aromatic rings with ether linkages suggests a complex balance of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects. The sulfur linkages may contribute to a higher property value, as seen in the example with CCSSCC.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 is likely to be positive but not as high as the example with CCSSCC. A reasonable estimate, taking into account the balance of structural features, would be around 0.9.

True Property: -0.6182831961868788
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can see that molecules with nitro groups attached to aromatic rings tend to have negative property values. For instance, Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.43092465, and Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 has a property value of -0.80564174. The presence of the nitro group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, generally contributes to a more negative property value.

Given this pattern, and considering the structural similarity of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O to the example Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O will also be negative and close to -0.43092465.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.43092465.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O

This molecule is a complex sugar-like structure, likely a polysaccharide or a similar carbohydrate. It contains multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups and ether linkages, which are characteristic of sugars.

From the examples provided, we can observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, such as carbohydrates, tend to have property values that are positive and relatively high. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, which is a simple sugar-like structure, has a property value of 0.67449076.

Given the complexity and the number of hydroxyl groups in the molecule OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar to or slightly higher than that of simpler sugar structures due to the increased number of hydroxyl groups and the overall size of the molecule.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.7 to 0.8. Based on the trend observed, I would predict a specific property value of approximately:

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.4496605063177302
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne. In the examples, linear alkanes and simple alkene structures tend to have positive property values, such as CCCCCCCCCC=O (0.55270771) and CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO (0.82437759). However, the presence of a triple bond (alkyne) might influence the property differently compared to alkanes and alkenes.

Given the examples, the presence of a nitrile group (C#N) in N#Cc1ccccc1C#N results in a negative property value (-0.82437759). However, the nitrile group is different from an alkyne, and the aromatic ring in that example also influences the property.

Considering the linear structure and the presence of the alkyne, the property value for CCC#C is likely to be slightly positive, similar to simple alkanes and alkenes, but potentially lower due to the presence of the triple bond.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C is around 0.36534916, similar to CC(C)OC=O, which is a simple ester with a positive property value.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 0.76817003.
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl, which has a property value of 0.94616065, and Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, which has a property value of 1.30214188.

Considering these structural similarities, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in the examples. The phosphorothioate group also contributes positively to the property value.

Based on these observations, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to the examples with similar functional groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.9.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is a pyridine derivative with a carbonyl group (C=O) and a hydrazine moiety (NN) attached to the pyridine ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2, which has a pyrimidine ring with carbonyl and amine groups, and has a property value of -0.87121723.

Considering the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl group and the potential electron-donating effect of the hydrazine moiety, the property value is likely to be negative, similar to other nitrogen-containing heterocycles with carbonyl groups in the examples.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be approximately -0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Several alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with sulfur-containing groups (e.g., CCS, CCBr) tend to have positive property values.
- Molecules with amide linkages (e.g., CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C) have slightly positive property values.
- Molecules with larger, more complex structures, especially those with aromatic rings, tend to have negative property values.

Given the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage, along with the absence of aromatic rings, the property value is likely to be slightly positive. However, the complexity of the structure and the presence of the piperidine ring might slightly reduce this value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around 0.15.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.8618493037756494
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a physicochemical property such as hydrophobicity or solubility. Linear alkanes, such as the ones in the examples, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule "CCCCCCCO" has a property value of 0.82437759, and "CCCC/C=C/C" has a value of 0.6182832. 

The molecule "CCCCCCCC" is a linear alkane (octane), similar in structure to "CCCCCCCO" but without the terminal alcohol group. Given the trend that longer carbon chains tend to have higher positive values, I would predict that "CCCCCCCC" would have a property value slightly higher than "CCCCCCCO" due to the absence of the polar alcohol group, which might slightly lower the value.

Therefore, I predict the property value for "CCCCCCCC" to be approximately 0.9.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbonyl group (C=O), as well as an alkyne group (C#C). The presence of these functional groups and the overall structure can influence the property value.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Polycyclic structures with carbonyl groups, such as CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCC3CCC2C3, tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of a hydroxyl group (O) in a polycyclic structure, as seen in CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, results in a positive property value.
- The presence of an alkyne group (C#C) is not directly represented in the examples, but it can contribute to a more negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

Considering these factors, the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative due to the combination of the carbonyl and alkyne groups, but the hydroxyl group may mitigate this effect somewhat.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.3.

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups. Based on the examples provided, molecules with complex polycyclic structures and multiple oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have negative property values. For instance, molecules like "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC=C)c1ccccc1" and "CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2" have negative property values.

Considering the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen atoms, which often contribute to a more negative property value, I would predict that the property value for this molecule is likely to be negative. Given the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value might be around -1.5. However, without a precise model or additional context, this is a qualitative prediction based on structural similarity to the examples provided.

True Property: 0.2154623259439123
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's consider the following relevant examples:
- Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (a nitrophenol) has a property value of -0.6182832.
- Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (another nitrophenol) also has a property value of -0.6182832.
- Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) has a property value of 0.06557549.
- Clc1ccccc1I (iodochlorobenzene) has a property value of 1.08667956.
- Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (dichlorobiphenyl) has a property value of -0.08431134.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is a phenol with a chlorine substituent. The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) typically contributes to a negative property value, as seen in the nitrophenol examples. However, the chlorine substituent can increase the property value, as seen in the chlorinated examples.

Considering the balance between the hydroxyl group and the chlorine substituent, the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is likely to be slightly negative, but not as negative as the nitrophenol examples. It is also likely to be less positive than the chlorinated examples without the hydroxyl group.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl is approximately -0.1.

To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 contains:
- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C)
- An ester linkage (OC(=O))
- An amide group (NC(=O))
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)

From the examples, we observe:
- Molecules with chlorinated aromatic rings tend to have negative property values, e.g., Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (-0.08431134) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (1.03047199).
- Molecules with ester and amide groups also tend to have negative property values, e.g., COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC (-0.8618493) and CCC(C)C1(CC(Br)=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O (-0.23419818).

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values, the presence of multiple electronegative atoms (Cl, O, N) and the aromatic ring suggests a negative property value. The combination of these features in the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 is likely to result in a property value similar to other chlorinated aromatic compounds with ester and amide functionalities.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be approximately -0.5.

True Property: -0.9555285759251757
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2) attached to the central carbon.
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have positive property values, especially when multiple chlorines are present (e.g., ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc2Cl).
- The presence of heterocycles like pyrimidine (c2cncnc2) can influence the property value, often leading to more negative values when combined with other electron-withdrawing groups.

Considering these factors, the molecule has a combination of features that suggest a balance between positive contributions from the chlorines and potential negative contributions from the pyrimidine and phenol groups. The presence of multiple chlorines and aromatic rings suggests a property value that is likely positive but not as high as those with more extensive halogenation.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl would be around 0.5.

The molecule CCCCCOC=O is an ester, specifically a linear alkyl ester. In the examples, we have similar structures:

1. CCCCCCC=O (hexanal) with a property value of 0.55270771.
2. CCCCCCCCC(=O)C (nonan-2-one) with a property value of 0.55270771.
3. CCCCOC=O (butyl formate) is not directly listed, but we can infer from similar structures.

The presence of the ester functional group (OC=O) and the linear alkyl chain suggests that the property value will be similar to those of linear alkanes and simple esters. The examples with linear alkanes and simple esters tend to have positive property values.

Given the structural similarity to the examples provided, particularly the linear alkyl chain and ester group, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be around 0.5, similar to the values for other linear alkanes and esters.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCOC=O is approximately:

The molecule "ClCCl" is similar to "ClCCCl" in terms of containing chlorine atoms and a simple carbon backbone. The property value for "ClCCCl" is 1.40518908. Given that "ClCCl" is a smaller molecule with a similar structure, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would be slightly lower due to the reduced size and complexity. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of "ClCCl" would be slightly less than 1.40518908, but still relatively high due to the presence of chlorine atoms. A predicted value could be around 1.3.

This structure is similar to the example CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, which has a property value of -0.05620756. Both molecules have a benzene ring with alkyl and hydroxyl substituents, which suggests they might have similar properties.

Given the structural similarity, the predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is likely to be close to -0.05620756. Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is approximately -0.05620756.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl, which is similar in structure to the chlorinated aromatic compounds provided in the examples.

From the examples, we observe that:

- Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.7588021.

True Property: 0.6182831961868789
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a small hydrocarbon with a branched structure and a double bond.

From the examples, we can observe that small hydrocarbons with similar structures, such as alkanes and alkenes, tend to have positive property values. For instance:

- CCCCC(CC)C=O has a property value of 0.55270771.
- CCC(C)CCC(C)(C)C has a property value of 0.8618493.
- CCCCCCCC has a property value of 0.8618493.
- CCCCCCCC(=O)C has a property value of 0.55270771.

These examples suggest that small hydrocarbons, especially those with branching or unsaturation, tend to have positive property values. Given that CC=C(C)C is a small, branched alkene, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value.

Considering the trend and the structural similarity to the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around 0.5. Therefore, the predicted specific property value for CC=C(C)C is approximately:

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1.4051890822429063
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we can analyze the patterns in the given examples. The property values seem to be influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecules.

In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, especially those with a high degree of chlorination, tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of 1.70496275, and Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1.57381177. These examples suggest that a high degree of chlorination correlates with higher property values.

The molecule ClCCl is a simple dichloromethane, which is less chlorinated than the highly chlorinated examples but still contains two chlorine atoms. Based on the trend observed, we can predict that ClCCl will have a positive property value, but likely lower than the highly chlorinated examples.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around 1.0.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.7588021044111695
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (2,4,6-trichlorophenol) has a property value of 0.7588021.
- Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 (1,3,5-tribromobenzene) has a property value of 1.4801325.

The presence of multiple halogens, particularly chlorine, tends to increase the property value compared to non-halogenated or less halogenated aromatic compounds. Given that Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is similar to Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, we can reasonably predict that the property value will be close to 0.7588021.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is approximately 0.7588021.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -2.2576704588036023
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as aromatic rings. The presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters, and phenols) generally contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in several examples with similar functional groups.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing groups, the property value is likely to be negative. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -1.0 to -1.5. However, without a precise computational model or additional context, this remains an estimation.

Therefore, a predicted specific property value for the molecule could be approximately -1.2.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.1124151265794324
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) atoms, along with the carbonyl group (C=O), suggests potential for polar interactions, which could influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar functional groups and heteroatoms, such as CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C, have a property value of -0.27166989. This example is particularly relevant because it also contains a similar heterocyclic structure with nitrogen and sulfur atoms, as well as a tert-butyl group.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of the functional groups, the predicted property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is likely to be close to -0.27166989. Therefore, the predicted specific property value for this molecule is approximately:

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.36534916138315554
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is an ester, specifically ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ethyl group (CCO) attached to a benzoate group (c1ccccc1C(=O)O).

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Simple aliphatic esters like CCCCC(=O)OCC have a property value of 0.36534916.
- Aromatic esters or compounds with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups tend to have negative property values, such as CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O with a value of -0.73069832.

Given that CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an aromatic ester, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. However, it is less complex than some of the more negative examples, such as those with additional functional groups or heteroatoms.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around -0.73069832, similar to other aromatic esters with a single carbonyl group attached to an aromatic ring. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

-0.73069832

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 1.3115098100933793
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their properties. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of functional groups and the overall size and shape of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached. In the examples, linear alkyl chains like CCCCCCCO (0.82437759) and CCCCCCCC (0.6182832) have positive property values. The presence of a bromine atom, as seen in Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (0.09367927), also contributes to a positive property value, though it is smaller than the alkyl chains.

Considering these factors, CCCCCCCBr is likely to have a positive property value, similar to other linear alkyl chains, but slightly adjusted due to the presence of the bromine atom. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around 0.7.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 0.8243775949158385
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide), we can analyze the trends in the given examples. The examples include a variety of organic and inorganic compounds with different functional groups and structures, and their associated property values range from highly negative to positive.

Carbon monoxide is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is a small, non-polar molecule with no additional functional groups or complex structure. In the given examples, smaller and simpler molecules, such as CCC (propane) and CC#C (propyne), tend to have positive property values. However, CO is even simpler and more polar than these examples.

Considering the simplicity and polarity of CO, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly positive, but not as high as the more complex or less polar small molecules. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO would be around:

0.1
