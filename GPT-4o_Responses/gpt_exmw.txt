SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.04991592522472173
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the trends in the given examples. The molecule is a linear ester with a long carbon chain, similar to CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which has a property value of 0.4482295. The molecule in question has one less carbon in the chain, which might slightly decrease the property value due to the reduced hydrophobic character and molecular size.

Considering the trend that longer carbon chains in esters tend to have slightly higher property values, I would predict the property value for CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC to be slightly lower than 0.4482295. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be approximately 0.398.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.14120610685058596
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a fused heterocyclic structure, specifically a chlorinated benzoxazole. The presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in several examples. The heterocyclic structure with an oxygen and nitrogen atom can also influence the property value, often leading to a moderate increase compared to simple hydrocarbons.

Based on the examples, chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values, while the presence of heteroatoms like oxygen and nitrogen can further increase this value. Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is likely to be positive and moderately high.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be approximately 1.2.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7312084191401347
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite, which contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O).

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, tend to have negative property values. The presence of the nitro group, which is electron-withdrawing, likely contributes to this trend. Additionally, smaller aliphatic chains, like those in CCC(C)CC and CCCCCl, also tend to have negative property values.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative. Based on the trends in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O would be approximately -0.5.

True Property: 4.76522177339398
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO

This molecule appears to be a polycyclic compound with multiple rings and carbonyl groups. It resembles steroid-like structures, which are often complex and have multiple fused rings. In the examples provided, complex polycyclic structures with multiple rings and carbonyl groups tend to have higher property values. For instance:

- Cc1c(F)c(F)c(COC(=O)C2C(C=C(Cl)C(F)(F)F)C2(C)C)c(F)c1F has a property value of 10.78884144.
- CC(C)OC(=O)C(O)(c1ccc(Br)cc1)c2ccc(Br)cc2 has a property value of 11.92449623.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 8.364851.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple rings and carbonyl groups in the target molecule, it is reasonable to predict a relatively high property value. However, it is not as high as the most complex examples due to the absence of heavy halogens or additional functional groups that significantly increase the property value.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately:

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 3.0179974615852574
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A benzene ring with two fluorine atoms (Fc1cccc(F)c1), similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.36234192.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N), which is a common feature in several molecules with negative property values.
- A chlorinated benzene ring (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -0.35480453.

Considering these structural features and the property values of similar molecules, the presence of electron-withdrawing groups (fluorine and chlorine) and the amide linkage suggest a negative property value. The combination of these features is likely to result in a property value that is slightly more negative than the average of the similar structures.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be approximately -0.4.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple ether with a linear chain and a branching methyl group. 

Looking at the examples, similar simple aliphatic ethers and alcohols, such as CCCCCCO (-0.73577273) and CCCCCC(O)CC (-0.4861116), have negative property values. The presence of the ether group and the branching in CCCOC(C)C suggests it might have a similar property value to these examples.

Given this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C would be around -0.6.

True Property: 1.404952570165481
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with two carbonyl groups and a bromine atom. The presence of carbonyl groups typically increases the property value due to their polar nature, while the bromine atom can also contribute to an increase in the property value due to its size and electronegativity.

Looking at the examples, molecules with halogens and carbonyl groups tend to have positive property values, especially when they are part of an aromatic or heteroaromatic system. For instance, the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of 0.4435867, and it contains a carbonyl group and a bromine atom on an aromatic ring.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to the example with a bromine atom and carbonyl group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.4 to 0.5.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.29153619796287206
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a physicochemical property such as hydrophobicity, solubility, or a similar characteristic.

Biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic hydrocarbon consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples provided, aromatic compounds with multiple rings or halogen substitutions tend to have higher property values, while simpler hydrocarbons or those with fewer aromatic rings tend to have lower values.

For instance, the molecule Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a property value of 0.98920056. The molecule c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67, which is a highly condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a much higher property value of 2.61580099.

Given that biphenyl is less complex than these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but more complex than simple aliphatic hydrocarbons, its property value is likely to be moderate. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around 0.5.

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.7258520271613275
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends related to the molecular structure and the associated property values.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a sulfur atom at the end. This structure is similar to linear alkanes, which generally have negative property values in the examples provided. For instance, CCCCCCC=C has a property value of -0.51433663, and CCCCCCC(C)C has a property value of -0.59308899. These examples suggest that linear or slightly branched alkanes tend to have negative property values.

Considering the presence of sulfur, which is more electronegative than carbon and can introduce some polarity, the property value might be slightly less negative compared to a similar hydrocarbon without sulfur. However, the overall trend for linear alkanes suggests a negative value.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be around -0.5, slightly adjusted for the presence of sulfur. Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCCCS could be approximately:

-0.45

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.5807751786649383
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol, specifically 2-methyl-2-butanol. In the examples, we have several aliphatic hydrocarbons and alcohols:

- CCC(C)(C)C: -0.74517485
- CC(C)CC(C)O: -0.66349308
- CCCC(C)(O)CC: -0.58077518

The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) in alcohols generally increases the property value compared to similar hydrocarbons without the OH group. The examples show that the presence of an OH group in a similar structure (CC(C)CC(C)O) results in a property value of -0.66349308, which is higher than the corresponding hydrocarbon (CCC(C)(C)C) with a value of -0.74517485.

Given that CCCC(C)(C)CO is similar to CC(C)CC(C)O but with a slightly longer carbon chain, we can expect the property value to be slightly higher than -0.66349308 due to the additional carbon, but still negative due to the overall aliphatic nature.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO would be around -0.65.

From the examples, we have:

- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) with a property value of 0.12586664.
- Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (another naphthalene derivative) with a property value of -0.27304164.

The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is structurally similar to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, which is also a naphthalene derivative. Given the similarity in structure, we can expect the property value to be close to that of Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately -0.27304164.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a cyclic compound with a urea-like structure (a diketopiperazine) and an alkyl side chain. The examples provided show that similar cyclic structures with carbonyl groups and alkyl chains tend to have property values around zero or slightly positive. For instance, the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a property value of 0.0.

Considering the structural similarity and the presence of additional alkyl groups, which might slightly increase the property value due to increased hydrophobicity, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be slightly above zero.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is approximately 0.1.

True Property: -0.3623419170577699
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of halogens, especially multiple halogens, tends to increase the property value. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of 0.88770404, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 5.65760102. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms significantly increases the property value.

In the case of trifluoromethylbenzene, the trifluoromethyl group is electron-withdrawing and can have a significant impact on the property value. However, it is not as strong as having multiple halogens like chlorine or iodine.

Considering these factors, the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is likely to be positive but not as high as those with multiple chlorine atoms. A reasonable prediction for the property value of trifluoromethylbenzene would be around 0.5 to 1.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is approximately 0.8.

To predict the property value for the molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is a sugar, specifically a form of glucose, which is a polyhydroxylated cyclic compound.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have property values close to zero. The example OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO has a property value of -8.322e-05, which is very close to zero.

Given that OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is also a polyhydroxylated compound similar to the example, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be very close to zero.

Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately 0.0.

CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C

This molecule is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. It resembles some of the more complex structures in the examples, such as:

- CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C, which has a property value of 2.69430907.

The given molecule has structural similarities to these examples, particularly in the presence of multiple rings and ketone groups. The presence of an ester group (CC(=O)O) might slightly lower the property value compared to the first example, but the overall complexity and the presence of multiple rings suggest a relatively high property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 3.5.

The given molecule is a polycyclic compound with multiple cyclohexane rings and a ketone group. It resembles some of the more complex structures in the examples, such as CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 1.70726883.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of a ketone group, which can influence the property value, the predicted property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O is likely to be in a similar range to the example with a similar structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 1.7.

- The presence of an amide group (C(=O)N) is seen in several molecules, such as CNC(=O)C=C(C)OP(=O)(OC)OC (0.59727162) and CN(C)C(=O)NC1CCCCCCC1 (0.20745421), which tend to have positive or slightly positive property values.
- Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups tend to have property values around or slightly below zero.

Considering these factors, the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is likely to have a property value slightly below zero due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group, but not too negative due to the presence of the amide group.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O would be around -0.3.

The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), an ester linkage (OCC), a thioether linkage (SC), and a chlorinated aromatic ring. These features suggest a complex structure with potential for significant interactions.

The presence of a chlorinated aromatic ring, as seen in some examples, often contributes to a positive property value. The phosphorothioate group and ester linkage might also contribute to a higher property value due to their potential for interactions and increased molecular complexity.

Considering these factors and comparing them to the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be around 1.5. This value reflects the influence of the chlorinated aromatic ring and the complex functional groups present in the molecule.

True Property: -0.7357727288005659
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)(C)CO is a simple alcohol, specifically tert-butanol. It has a tertiary carbon attached to a hydroxyl group. In the examples, we have several alcohols and hydrocarbons with varying chain lengths and branching, such as:

- CCC (propane) with a property value of -0.9086172
- CC(C)CO (isobutanol) with a property value of -0.79893135
- CCCCCCC(C)O (octanol) with a property value of -0.3777772

The property values for alcohols tend to be negative, and the value becomes less negative as the chain length increases or branching occurs. Given that tert-butanol is more branched than isobutanol, we can expect its property value to be slightly less negative than that of isobutanol.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO (tert-butanol) would be around -0.75.

- Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1, with a property value of -0.61214853
- COc2ncc1nccnc1n2, with a property value of -0.21657383

These examples contain nitrogen heterocycles and some have carbonyl groups, similar to the target molecule. The property values for these examples are all negative and relatively close to each other, suggesting that the presence of nitrogen heterocycles and carbonyl groups tends to result in a negative property value.

Given the structural similarity of O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 to these examples, particularly the purine-like structure, it is reasonable to predict a property value in the same negative range. 

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 would be approximately -0.5.

Isopropyl acetate is an ester, which is somewhat similar to the alcohols and ketones in terms of functional groups. The property values for these similar molecules are all negative and range from approximately -0.85 to -0.67.

Considering the structure of isopropyl acetate and the property values of similar molecules, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around -0.7. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O is approximately:

The molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 is a symmetrical urea derivative with two phenyl groups attached to the nitrogen atoms. This structure is similar to other aromatic amide or urea compounds in the examples, such as NC(=O)c1cccnc1 (-0.54235439) and CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1 (-0.03469488).

Given the presence of two phenyl rings and the urea linkage, the molecule is likely to have a property value that reflects the balance between the electron-withdrawing carbonyl groups and the electron-donating phenyl groups. The examples suggest that aromatic amides and ureas tend to have property values around -0.5 to 0.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The given molecule is triphenylene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a planar structure composed of four fused benzene rings.

From the examples, we can observe that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 (a larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon), have a property value of 0.68997693. Smaller aromatic compounds, like benzene derivatives, tend to have negative or small positive property values.

Given that triphenylene is a smaller polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon compared to the example with a property value of 0.68997693, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is positive but likely smaller than 0.68997693.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (triphenylene) would be approximately 0.5.

- An aromatic ring (c1ccc(N)cc1) with an amine substituent, which can also contribute to a moderate increase in the property value due to the presence of nitrogen atoms and the aromatic system.
- An additional amine group (NC(=N)N), which can further increase the property value due to its polar nature.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and polar substituents, such as nitro or chloro groups, tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of multiple nitrogen atoms and a sulfonamide group suggests a property value that is likely positive but not extremely high.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 would be around 1.0.

- Molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O (3.22880035) and ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccccc2Cl (3.41865258), tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro and trifluoromethyl can increase the property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be positive and in the range of similar structures with electron-withdrawing groups and aromatic rings. A reasonable prediction would be around 2.5 to 3.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O is approximately 3.0.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.7359844630509668
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate. It is an ester, similar to some of the molecules in the examples. Esters generally have a range of property values depending on their specific structure and substituents.

Looking at the examples:
- CCC(C)(C)O has a property value of -0.73577273.
- CC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of -0.58105248.
- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 has a property value of -0.18632314.
- CCCCCOC(=O)C has a property value of -0.48642895.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is smaller and less complex than some of these examples, but it shares structural similarities with the esters. Given the trend in the examples, the property value for CC(C)OC=O is likely to be negative and closer to the simpler esters.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be approximately -0.6.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.5420874115206163
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the simpler aromatic compounds in the examples.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is structurally similar to c1ccccc1O (phenol), which has a property value of -0.70623298. The presence of additional methyl groups in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 could slightly alter the property value, but it is likely to remain in a similar range due to the aromatic nature and the presence of the hydroxyl group.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be slightly higher than that of phenol due to the additional methyl group, but still negative. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.65.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 1.8805182732865118
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S) with methoxy groups (OC) and a substituted aromatic ring. The examples provided show that molecules with similar phosphorothioate groups and halogenated aromatic rings tend to have higher property values, often in the range of 3 to 10. However, the molecule in question does not have halogen substituents, which typically contribute to higher property values.

Instead, the molecule has a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) on the aromatic ring. These substituents are less electron-withdrawing compared to halogens, which suggests a lower property value compared to the halogenated examples.

Considering the examples with similar structures and substituents, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 would be around 2.5. This accounts for the presence of the phosphorothioate group, which increases the property value, but also considers the less electron-withdrawing nature of the thiomethyl and methyl groups compared to halogens.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: 3.7137202256203294
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples given.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with multiple chlorine atoms attached to the biphenyl structure. In the examples, highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have higher property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 5.65760102, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 8.364851.

Given the structure of the target molecule, which is similar to these highly chlorinated examples, we can predict that its property value will also be relatively high. However, it has fewer chlorine atoms than the example with a value of 8.364851, so its property value should be lower than that but potentially higher than 5.65760102.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 6.5.

Iteration: 30
SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.7312084191401347
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to the end. 

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have positive property values, especially when they are attached to aromatic rings or larger structures. However, in this case, the nitro group is attached to a short aliphatic chain, which might not contribute as significantly to a positive value as it would in an aromatic system.

The closest example in terms of structure might be CCC, which has a property value of -0.9086172. Adding a nitro group could increase the property value, but given the simplicity of the structure, it might not increase it to a large positive number.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be slightly negative or close to zero. A specific predicted value could be around -0.2.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.08247056241616657
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene ring with a bromine substituent. 

From the examples, we can observe the following:
- Halogenated benzene rings tend to have positive property values, especially when multiple halogens are present.
- For example, Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of 0.11534943, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl has a property value of 2.31795974.
- The presence of a fluorine atom, as in Nc2cnn(c1ccccc1)c(=O)c2Cl (0.5706997), suggests a moderate increase in the property value.

Considering these observations, the presence of both fluorine and bromine on the benzene ring in Fc1cccc(Br)c1 suggests a property value that is likely positive and possibly slightly higher than Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 due to the additional electronegativity of fluorine.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be around 0.2 to 0.3. Let's choose a specific value within this range:

0.25

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.29116362942188473
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with an additional methyl group and a hydroxyl group. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with cyclic and bicyclic structures.

Looking at the examples, we see that cyclic and bicyclic structures with alcohol groups tend to have negative property values, such as:

- CCC1CCCO1, -0.7453826
- CC(C)(C)CO, -0.73577273

Given the structural similarity and the presence of the alcohol group, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 will also be negative and in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is approximately -0.74.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)
- An amide linkage (N2C(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)

Comparing this structure to the examples:
- The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O has a similar phosphorothioate group and an amide linkage, with a property value of 8.22980609.
- The presence of a phenyl ring is common in many examples, often contributing to moderate property values.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage, the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is likely to be in a similar range to the example with the phosphorothioate group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is approximately 8.0.

Iteration: 34
SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 0.07407379150333059
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1C, which has a property value of -0.55512799. However, the presence of the carbonyl group and the nitrogen heterocycle in the target molecule could influence the property value.

The presence of the carbonyl group (C=O) and the nitrogen heterocycle (n(c2ccccc2)n) suggests that the molecule might have a slightly higher property value compared to simple alkylbenzenes due to potential electronic effects and increased molecular complexity.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be slightly higher than -0.55512799, but not as high as molecules with more complex or polar functional groups.

Therefore, a predicted property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C could be around -0.3.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.37814038719274223
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which is a linear chain with a total of 9 carbon atoms.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCCCC(=O)OC, which is a similar ester with a slightly shorter chain, has a property value of -0.11238945.
- CCCCC, a simple alkane with 5 carbon atoms, has a property value of -0.807147.
- CCCCCCCCI, a linear chain with an iodine atom, has a property value of 0.64977882.

The presence of the ester functional group (C(=O)O) typically increases the property value compared to simple alkanes due to its polar nature. However, the overall chain length and the specific functional groups present will influence the final value.

Given the similarity to CCCCCCC(=O)OC, which has a property value of -0.11238945, and considering the additional ethyl group in CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, the property value is likely to be slightly more negative due to the increased chain length and the presence of the ester group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be approximately -0.1.

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.44217283105979727
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is methyl benzoate, an ester with a benzene ring.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 with a property value of -0.17634049. This molecule is ethyl salicylate, which is an ester with a benzene ring and an additional hydroxyl group.
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 with a property value of -0.32749303. This molecule is ethyl benzoate, which is very similar to methyl benzoate but with an ethyl group instead of a methyl group.

Given that methyl benzoate (COC(=O)c1ccccc1) is structurally similar to ethyl benzoate (CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1), we can expect the property value to be close to that of ethyl benzoate. The presence of a methyl group instead of an ethyl group might slightly affect the property, but not drastically.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.32749303.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.823467705538073
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are likely related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a physicochemical property such as hydrophobicity, solubility, or a similar characteristic.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, also known as 1,3-butadiene. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons and small molecules with similar structures tend to have negative property values. For instance, CC/C=C/C (a linear hydrocarbon with a double bond) has a property value of -0.81538646, and C1CCCC1 (cyclopentane) has the same value.

Given this pattern, it is reasonable to predict that C=CCC=C will also have a negative property value, likely in a similar range to these simple hydrocarbons. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C is approximately -0.81538646.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br, also known as tribromomethane or bromoform, is a simple halogenated methane with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly bromine, tend to have positive property values. For instance, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of 0.33434685, and Ic1cccc2ccccc12 has a property value of 1.23184266.

Given the simplicity of BrC(Br)Br compared to the more complex aromatic structures in the examples, we can expect its property value to be positive but not as high as those of the more complex molecules. Considering the influence of multiple bromine atoms, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule contains several functional groups and structural features that can influence its property value:

1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P=S)**: This group is present in the molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 6.13609146. The presence of the P=S group can contribute to a higher property value.

2. **Amide Group (N-C=O)**: The molecule contains an amide linkage, similar to the structure in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which also contributes to the property value.

3. **Chlorine Substituent (CCl)**: The presence of a chlorine atom can increase the property value, as seen in several examples with chlorinated aromatic rings.

4. **Aromatic Ring**: The presence of an aromatic ring, as seen in many examples, can also influence the property value.

Considering these factors and comparing them to the examples, the molecule is likely to have a relatively high property value due to the combination of the phosphorothioate group, amide linkage, chlorine substituent, and aromatic ring.

Based on the analysis and comparison with similar structures, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 6.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Functional Groups and Structural Features:**
   - The molecule contains an amide group (C(=O)N), which is present in several examples with varying property values.
   - It has a chloro-substituted aromatic ring, similar to some examples with positive property values.
   - The molecule also contains a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen, which can influence the property.
   - The presence of a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C) can increase the hydrophobicity, potentially affecting the property value.

2. **Comparison with Examples:**
   - Molecules with chloro-substituted aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 (0.5961611) and Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (2.31795974), tend to have positive property values.
   - Molecules with amide groups, such as CCC(=O)NC1=O (0.96864345), also show positive property values.
   - The presence of a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen, as seen in some examples, can contribute to a positive property value.

3. **Prediction:**
   - Considering the structural features and their influence on the property, the molecule is likely to have a positive property value.
   - Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups that tend to increase the property value, a reasonable prediction would be a value slightly above 1.

Based on these considerations, the predicted property value for CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C is approximately **1.2**.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which is structurally similar to some of the examples given. Specifically, it resembles the structure of chlorinated aromatic compounds, such as:

- Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a property value of -0.20819456
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, which has a property value of 0.7578125

The molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has two chlorinated phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms and the ether linkage suggests that the property value might be influenced by both the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine atoms and the ether linkage.

Considering the examples, the presence of additional chlorine atoms tends to increase the property value, as seen in the example with multiple chlorines. However, the ether linkage might moderate this effect compared to a fully chlorinated benzene ring.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be slightly higher than the value for Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, but not as high as the fully chlorinated example. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.3.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC/C=C\C, we can look at the example provided for a similar molecule, CC/C=C/C, which has a property value of -0.81538646. The only difference between the two molecules is the stereochemistry around the double bond, which is unlikely to significantly affect the property value in this context. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C would be very close to that of CC/C=C/C.

Predicted property value for CC/C=C\C: -0.81538646

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOCC is a linear chain with an ether functional group, similar to some of the simpler aliphatic compounds in the examples.

Looking at the examples, simple aliphatic chains like CCC(O)CC and CCCCCC have property values of -0.73577273 and -0.60543847, respectively. The presence of an ether group (O) in CCCOCC might slightly alter the property value compared to a simple alkane, but it is still likely to be negative and close to these values.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be around -0.7. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOCC is approximately:

-0.7

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

This molecule contains:
- A tertiary amide group (N(C=O)N) similar to the structure CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 2.54267489.
- Two phenyl rings, which are also present in the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3.
- A tertiary butyl group (C(C)(C)c1ccccc1), which is a bulky substituent that can influence the property value.

The presence of the tertiary amide and two phenyl rings suggests a similarity to the example with a property value of 2.54267489. However, the tertiary butyl group may slightly alter the property value due to its steric and electronic effects.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be close to 2.54267489, but slightly adjusted due to the tertiary butyl group. A reasonable prediction would be around 2.5.

- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1), which is similar to the structure Fc1cccc(Br)c1 with a property value of -0.08247056 and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 with a property value of -0.10435208.

Considering these structural similarities, particularly the presence of the bromobenzene moiety, which tends to have a property value close to neutral, and the acetamide group, which does not significantly deviate from neutral, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to be slightly negative or close to zero.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately -0.1.

True Property: -0.4567605811176452
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules from the provided examples.

The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is isopropylbenzene, also known as cumene. It consists of an isopropyl group (CC(C)) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1). 

From the examples, we have:
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethylbenzene) with a property value of -0.55512799
- Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) with a property value of -0.6354003
- C=Cc1ccccc1 (styrene) with a property value of -0.65251031
- N#Cc1ccccc1 (benzonitrile) with a property value of -0.65825294

These examples suggest that aromatic compounds with alkyl or simple substituents tend to have property values in the range of approximately -0.55 to -0.66. The presence of an isopropyl group, which is slightly bulkier than an ethyl group, might slightly affect the property value, but it is likely to remain within this range.

Given this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 (cumene) would be around -0.60.

Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6413341240504966
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have higher property values, while those with electron-donating groups, such as methoxy groups, tend to have lower property values. The presence of halogens also seems to increase the property value.

Benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, but not as strongly as nitro groups. Comparing it to similar structures, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (-0.43459189) and COc1ccccc1 (-0.62968735), benzaldehyde is expected to have a property value that is less negative than COc1ccccc1 but possibly more negative than NC(=O)c1ccccc1O, due to the absence of additional electron-withdrawing groups like the nitro group in the latter.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 would be around -0.5. Therefore, the predicted property value for benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) is approximately:

-0.500

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group and an oxazole ring. The presence of a nitro group (N(=O)=O) and an aromatic ring (c1ccc(o1)) suggests that the molecule might have a relatively high property value, as seen in some of the examples with similar functional groups.

For instance, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings, such as Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 (2.05813023) and COc2ccc(Oc1ccc(NC(=O)N(C)C)cc1)cc2 (2.12963955), have property values above 2.0. However, the presence of additional heteroatoms and the specific structure of the molecule can influence the property value.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be around 1.8. This accounts for the influence of the nitro group and the aromatic ring, while also considering the potential moderating effect of the heterocyclic structure.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.02477163119598032
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diarylamine, where two phenyl rings are connected through a nitrogen atom. 

Looking at the examples, we have:
- N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 with a property value of 0.0005589. This molecule is similar in that it also has two phenyl rings connected through a nitrogen, but with an additional nitrogen double-bonded to one of the phenyl rings.
- Nc1ccccc1 with a property value of -0.711225, which is a simpler aniline structure with one phenyl ring attached to an amine group.

The target molecule, N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, is structurally similar to the first example but lacks the double-bonded nitrogen, which might slightly lower the property value due to the absence of the additional nitrogen's influence.

Considering these comparisons, the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be close to 0.0005589 but slightly lower due to the absence of the double-bonded nitrogen. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.1.

True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a bicyclic compound with two amide groups and a cyclohexane ring. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with cyclic structures and amide groups. For instance, the molecule C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1 has a similar bicyclic structure with amide groups and has a property value of 0.03677356. Another example, O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, has a property value of 0.65295557.

Considering these examples, the presence of the cyclohexane ring and the amide groups suggests that the property value is likely to be in a similar range. The structural similarity to the example with a property value of 0.03677356 suggests that the property value for the given molecule might be close to this value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately 0.04.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl 
True Property: 1.3157648866662646
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, tend to have higher property values. This particular example has a property value of 5.24665922.

2. Simpler chlorinated aromatic compounds, such as Clc1ccccc1Cl, have lower property values, like -0.35480453.

3. The presence of additional aromatic rings and chlorine atoms generally increases the property value.

Given that Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a biphenyl with three chlorine atoms, it is more complex than Clc1ccccc1Cl but less complex than the highly chlorinated example with a property value of 5.24665922.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 2.5 to 3.5. However, since it is less complex than the example with a value of 5.24665922, a more precise estimate would be slightly lower than the midpoint of this range.

Therefore, a predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately 3.0.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.4567605811176452
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

From the examples, we can observe that simple aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions tend to have property values around -0.6. For instance, Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) has a property value of -0.6354003, and Cc1ccccn1 (pyridine) also has a similar value of -0.6354003. These examples suggest that the presence of an aromatic ring with alkyl groups tends to result in a property value in this range.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a diethylbenzene, which is structurally similar to the examples mentioned, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be close to these examples. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is approximately -0.6354003.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is a sulfonamide derivative, which is similar in some respects to the nitrobenzene derivatives in the examples. The presence of the sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is somewhat analogous to the nitro group (N(=O)=O) in terms of electron-withdrawing effects, which can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, the nitrobenzene derivative Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.42693858. The sulfonamide group is also electron-withdrawing, but it might have a slightly different effect compared to the nitro group due to differences in electronegativity and resonance effects.

Considering these factors, the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is likely to be in a similar range to the nitrobenzene derivative, but potentially slightly more negative due to the additional electronegativity of the sulfonamide group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be approximately -0.45.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically triphenylene, which consists of three fused benzene rings forming a planar structure.

Looking at the examples, we can identify similar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and their property values:

- c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12: 0.96815581
- c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54: 1.19056042

Both of these examples are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with multiple fused benzene rings. The property values for these molecules are relatively close to each other, suggesting that the property value for triphenylene might also fall within this range.

Given the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 (triphenylene) would be around 1.0. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the more complex aromatic structures in the examples, particularly those with multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings, which tend to have higher property values.

For instance, the molecule Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 has a property value of 3.34237814, and it shares some structural similarities with the given molecule, such as the presence of multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups.

Considering these structural similarities and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 is likely to be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 3.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)O), an amide group (NC(C)=O), and a thioether linkage (SC). The presence of the phosphorothioate group is significant, as it is a common feature in some of the examples with higher property values, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (3.48642295) and CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C (5.18455192).

However, the molecule in question is simpler and lacks the aromatic rings and additional substituents that contribute to higher property values in those examples. The presence of the amide group and the thioether linkage suggests a moderate property value, as seen in other molecules with similar functional groups.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is likely to be positive but not as high as those with more complex structures. A reasonable estimate would be around 1.5 to 2.0.

Therefore, the predicted specific property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is approximately 1.8.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -0.6916044823219443
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, symmetrical molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. In the examples, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly chlorine, tend to have positive property values when they are part of larger, more complex aromatic or polycyclic structures. However, smaller, simpler molecules with halogens, such as chlorinated alkanes, tend to have negative property values.

Given the simplicity and symmetry of Cl\C=C/Cl, and considering the examples of small chlorinated compounds like Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl (-0.20819456) and Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (-0.50503658), it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for Cl\C=C/Cl.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl is approximately -0.3.

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: -0.7774813204306141
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and their properties. Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle with a nitrogen atom in the ring, similar to benzene but with one carbon replaced by nitrogen.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23, have a property value of -0.02318893. This compound is a more complex aromatic system with nitrogen atoms, but it provides a reference for the effect of nitrogen in an aromatic ring.

Considering the simpler structure of pyridine compared to the more complex aromatic systems with nitrogen, we can expect the property value to be slightly more negative due to the smaller size and less extensive conjugation.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccncc1 (pyridine) would be approximately -0.05.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has several key features:
1. An ester linkage (OC(=O)).
2. A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1).
3. An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23).
4. A pyridine-like structure (ccnc).
5. A chlorine substituent on an aromatic ring.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and amide linkages, such as CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2 (0.59838282) and O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 (0.41459971), tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of chlorine on an aromatic ring, as seen in Clc1ccc(I)cc1 (0.88770404) and Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (0.7578125), also contributes to positive property values.
- The combination of aromatic rings, amide linkages, and halogen substituents generally results in positive property values.

Considering these observations, the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 is likely to have a positive property value due to its structural similarity to the examples with positive values.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately 0.5.

Iteration: 60
SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.7357727288005659
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the trends in the given examples. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a terminal hydroxyl group, making it a primary alcohol (1-pentanol).

From the examples, we observe that:

1. Linear alkanes and simple alcohols tend to have negative property values. For instance, OC1CCCCCCC1 (a cyclic alcohol) has a property value of -0.5005151, and CCC(C)Cl (a simple alkyl chloride) has a property value of -0.71404497.

2. The presence of a hydroxyl group (as in alcohols) generally results in a less negative or slightly positive property value compared to alkanes without functional groups.

3. The length of the carbon chain and the presence of functional groups like hydroxyls influence the property value, with longer chains and more polar groups generally leading to less negative or slightly positive values.

Considering these observations, CCCCCO, being a primary alcohol with a moderate chain length, is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero, but not as negative as simple alkanes or halogenated alkanes.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be around -0.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a sulfonamide with a cyclic structure, containing a benzene ring, a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), and an amide linkage (C(=O)N). The presence of these functional groups can significantly influence the property value.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with sulfonyl groups, such as CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C, tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of aromatic rings, like in Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2, can also contribute to a moderate property value.
- Amide linkages, as seen in O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC, tend to have property values around zero or slightly positive.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is likely to be moderately positive, reflecting the influence of the sulfonyl group and the aromatic ring.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 0.5.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:

1. **Aromatic Ring**: The presence of an aromatic ring (c2ccccc2) is a common feature in many of the examples, often contributing to a moderate property value.

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The presence of a nitro group is known to increase the property value, as seen in examples like CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O (4.15319057).

3. **Ester Groups (C(=O)OC)**: The molecule contains ester groups, which are also present in some examples with higher property values, such as CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC (3.90423014).

4. **Heterocyclic Ring with Nitrogen**: The presence of a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen (C1=C(C)NC) can influence the property value, as seen in some examples.

Considering these features, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is moderately high, influenced by the aromatic ring, nitro group, and ester groups. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 3.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two amide groups and a cyclohexane-like structure due to the cyclization of the peptide bond. This structure is relatively small and lacks significant functional groups that would contribute to a high property value, such as multiple halogens or large aromatic systems.

Looking at the examples, smaller molecules with amide groups and without extensive aromatic or halogen substitution tend to have property values around or below zero. For instance, the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of 0.21222424, and it contains an amide group and a chloro-substituted aromatic ring.

Given the lack of extensive aromaticity or halogenation in the diketopiperazine, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is negative or close to zero. Considering the examples and the structural features of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of molecular structures with different functional groups and sizes, and their property values range from negative to positive.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure, consisting of a chloroethane (ethyl chloride) group. In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules, especially those with halogen atoms, tend to have negative property values. For instance, Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) has a property value of -0.60335421, and ClC1=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3C4CC(C=C4)C3C1(Cl)C2(Cl)Cl (a highly chlorinated compound) has a positive value, but it is much larger and more complex.

Given the simplicity and small size of ClCC, and considering the trend that smaller, less complex molecules with halogens often have negative property values, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for ClCC.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCC is approximately -0.7.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a pyridine ring and a trichloromethyl group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 1.31576489. Both molecules have chlorinated aromatic rings, but the target molecule has a pyridine ring instead of a benzene ring and an additional trichloromethyl group.

The presence of the pyridine nitrogen and the trichloromethyl group could increase the property value due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitrogen and the additional chlorine atoms. However, the overall structure is still similar to the example with a property value of 1.31576489.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is likely to be slightly higher than 1.31576489 due to the additional electron-withdrawing effects. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around 1.5.

True Property: -0.6634930765536935
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCC(C)O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCCC(C)O is a primary alcohol with a six-carbon chain, also known as 2-hexanol. 

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCC(O)CCC, which is a similar alcohol with a longer carbon chain, has a property value of -0.58077518.
- CCC(C)CCO, another alcohol with a similar structure but shorter chain, has a property value of -0.66349308.
- CCC(CC)CO, which is also similar, has the same property value of -0.66349308.

Given that CCCCC(C)O is structurally similar to these alcohols, we can infer that its property value will be in a similar range. Considering the trend that longer carbon chains tend to have slightly less negative values, the property value for CCCCC(C)O is likely to be slightly less negative than -0.66349308 but close to -0.58077518.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCC(C)O would be approximately -0.600.

To predict the property value for the molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is 1,4-dibromobenzene, which is an aromatic compound with two bromine atoms attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values. For instance:
   - Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl has a property value of 0.5961611.
   - Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O has a property value of 3.22880035.

2. The presence of multiple halogen atoms, especially heavier halogens like bromine, can increase the property value compared to lighter halogens like chlorine.

3. The property values for simple halogenated benzenes are generally positive but not very high unless additional functional groups are present.

Considering these points, 1,4-dibromobenzene is expected to have a positive property value, likely higher than that of chlorinated benzenes but not as high as more complex or heavily substituted aromatic compounds.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around 0.8 to 1.0. Given the examples and trends, I would predict a specific property value of approximately:

The molecule in question is a chlorinated biphenyl, similar to the example Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 24.69944521. The given molecule has a similar structure but with fewer chlorine atoms.

The example molecule is a highly chlorinated biphenyl with 10 chlorine atoms, while the molecule in question has 6 chlorine atoms. The property value is likely related to the degree of chlorination and the overall molecular structure.

Given the structural similarity and the reduced number of chlorine atoms, the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl is expected to be lower than 24.69944521 but still relatively high due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately 15.0.

The molecule in question is a triaryl phosphate ester, which consists of three aromatic rings connected through a phosphate group. The presence of aromatic rings and the phosphate group suggests that the molecule might have a moderate to high property value, similar to other aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups.

Looking at the examples, aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups (such as Cl or carbonyl groups) tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1 has a property value of 3.82958728, and COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a property value of 4.71842554.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (8.364851) and ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 (3.41865258), tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of a trifluoromethyl group, as in CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C (3.00207166), also suggests an increase in the property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O is likely to be moderately high, but not as high as the most chlorinated examples. A reasonable estimate would be around 3.5 to 4.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately 3.8.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.30125252772476335
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring, with a nitro group (NO2) also attached to the ring.

From the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.15646344.
- Molecules with methoxy groups, such as COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC, have a property value of 0.1513176.
- Simple aromatic compounds like c1ccccc1O have a property value of -0.70623298.

The presence of both a methoxy group and a nitro group on the benzene ring suggests that the property value will be influenced by both functional groups. The methoxy group is electron-donating, while the nitro group is electron-withdrawing. The combination of these effects will likely result in a property value that is between the values for molecules with only one of these groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around -0.2 to -0.3, as it balances the electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects. Therefore, a specific predicted property value could be approximately -0.25.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 2.27853131. The given molecule has even more chlorine atoms and a more complex structure, which suggests that it might have a higher property value due to increased molecular weight and potential for higher polarizability.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is likely to be higher than 2.27853131. A reasonable estimate, taking into account the increased complexity and chlorination, would be around 3.0.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.7359844630509675
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. Esters generally have a range of property values depending on their specific structure and substituents.

Looking at the examples, we can see that simple aliphatic chains and small functional groups tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCC#C has a property value of -0.87556002, and CCCCC#C has a property value of -0.7638525. The presence of an ester group (COC=O) might slightly increase the property value compared to a simple alkane or alkyne, but it is still likely to be negative based on the examples.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be around -0.5. This accounts for the small size of the molecule and the presence of the ester functional group, which might slightly increase the value compared to a simple alkane or alkyne.

The examples show that aliphatic compounds, especially those with ester groups, tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCOC (an ether) has a property value of -0.79893135, and CCCCC(CC)C=O (a ketone) has a property value of -0.5005151. The presence of the ester group in CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC might slightly increase the property value compared to a simple alkane, but it is still likely to be negative.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around -0.6 to -0.7. Therefore, a specific predicted value could be approximately -0.65.

- Molecules with phenol groups, such as Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1, have a property value of -0.37847867.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, have a property value of -0.54891629.

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro and chloro groups generally increases the property value, while the phenol and amide groups tend to decrease it. The combination of these functional groups suggests a property value that is slightly negative but not as low as the individual components due to the electron-withdrawing effects.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be around -0.2.

This is similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 6.13609146. The presence of multiple phosphorothioate groups and aromatic systems suggests a high property value, likely due to increased molecular complexity and potential for interactions.

Given the structural similarity and the presence of two phosphorothioate groups, I would predict a property value slightly higher than the example with one phosphorothioate group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 would be around 7.0.

- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, with a property value of -0.43459189. This is a nitrobenzene with a methyl group, which is similar to our target molecule in terms of having a nitro group on a benzene ring.

Given that Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is a combination of a phenol and a nitrobenzene, and considering the property values of similar structures, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O will be close to those of the similar structures provided.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. This molecule is a complex carbohydrate, likely a sugar or polysaccharide, characterized by multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages.

From the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages, such as sugars, tend to have property values around zero or slightly negative. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O has a property value of -0.32790369. Given the structural similarity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, the property value for the given molecule is likely to be in a similar range.

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne. It has a triple bond between the second and third carbon atoms. In the examples, we have several linear and branched alkanes and alkenes, but no direct example of an alkyne. However, we can infer some trends:

1. Linear alkanes and alkenes tend to have negative property values, often around -0.4 to -0.7.
2. The presence of a triple bond might slightly alter the property value compared to alkanes and alkenes, but it is likely to remain in the negative range.

Given these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around -0.5. This value accounts for the linear structure and the presence of the triple bond, which might slightly increase the property value compared to a similar alkane.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.5930889929878018
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (n-octane), we can analyze the trends from the given examples.

For instance, the property values for similar linear alkanes like CCCCCC (hexane) and CCCCCCCO (heptanol) are -0.58077518 and -0.5424011, respectively. 

Given that CCCCCCCC is a longer alkane chain than those examples, we can expect its property value to be slightly more negative due to increased hydrophobicity and molecular size. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (n-octane) would be around -0.6 to -0.7. 

A specific predicted property value for CCCCCCCC is -0.65000000.

- Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) has a property value of -0.69598661.
- Clc1ccccc1I (iodobenzene) has a property value of 0.88770404.
- Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2Cl (dichlorobiphenyl) has a property value of 0.5961611.

The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) in phenol derivatives tends to lower the property value compared to halogenated benzenes without hydroxyl groups. The presence of chlorine, which is more electronegative than iodine but less than fluorine, suggests that the property value might be between those of nitrophenol and fluorobenzene.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around -0.5. This accounts for the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine and the electron-donating effect of the hydroxyl group, balancing the property value between the examples provided.

- An ester linkage (OC(=O)), which is polar and can contribute to the overall polarity of the molecule.
- An amide group (NC(=O)), which is also polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1), which is similar to the chlorinated aromatic rings in some of the examples with higher property values.

From the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings tend to have higher property values, often positive. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 8.364851, and ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl has a property value of 2.27853131. These examples suggest that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings can significantly increase the property value.

Considering the structural features of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, it is likely to have a positive property value, but not as high as those with multiple chlorines on aromatic rings. A reasonable prediction, taking into account the polar and aromatic nature of the molecule, would be a property value around 1.5 to 2.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 is approximately 1.8.

- "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl" has a property value of 5.65760102.

The molecule "Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl" is a tetrachlorinated biphenyl, which is less chlorinated than the hexachlorinated biphenyl example but more chlorinated than the first example. Therefore, we can expect its property value to be between these two values.

From the examples, we can observe that small hydrocarbons with simple structures, such as alkanes and alkenes, tend to have negative property values. For instance:

- CCCCCCCC (octane) has a property value of -0.59308899.
- CCCCCCCC=C (nonene) has a property value of -0.41007835.
- CCCCCCCCCC (decane) has a property value of -0.5005151.

These examples suggest that small hydrocarbons with simple structures generally have negative property values. Given that isoprene is a small hydrocarbon with a branched structure and a double bond, it is reasonable to predict a similar negative property value.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.7510196036701926
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane), we can analyze the trends in the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

In the examples, simple hydrocarbons and small molecules with halogens tend to have negative property values. For instance, simple alkanes and alkenes like C=CCCC=C and CCC(C)C(C)C have negative values. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl, also have negative values, though the magnitude can vary based on the number of chlorine atoms and the overall structure.

Given that ClCCl is a small molecule with two chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. The examples with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, have very high positive values due to their complexity and number of chlorine atoms, but ClCCl is much simpler.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around -0.2 to -0.5. Based on the examples, a specific prediction could be:

**-0.3**

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.19553577036719172
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in molecules like Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 (3.18972586) and Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (0.19553577). The presence of multiple chlorine atoms tends to increase the property value further.

Given that Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl has three chlorine atoms, we can expect its property value to be higher than that of Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which has two chlorine atoms and a property value of 0.19553577. However, it is likely to be lower than Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1, which has a property value of 3.18972586, due to the different nature of bromine and chlorine atoms.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl would be around 0.5.

True Property: 60.33292722386011
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known molecules.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups. The presence of these features suggests a relatively high property value, as seen in some of the more complex and oxygen-rich structures in the examples.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen atoms, which often contribute to higher property values in the examples, a reasonable prediction would be a property value in the higher range of the provided examples. 

Considering the examples with similar complexity and oxygen content, such as the molecule with a property value of 10.14348297, a predicted property value for the given molecule could be around 9.5. This is an estimation based on the structural complexity and functional group analysis.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.44733877564847335
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of sulfur and nitrogen in the heterocyclic ring, along with the carbonyl group, suggests potential for moderate polarity and some degree of hydrogen bonding capability. The tert-butyl group contributes to hydrophobicity.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with similar heterocyclic structures and functional groups, such as CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C, have property values around 1.28609543.
- The presence of sulfur and nitrogen in heterocycles often results in positive property values, as seen in other examples.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is likely to be positive and in the range of similar structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately:

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.3274930321909881
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ethyl benzoate, which is an ester formed from benzoic acid and ethanol. 

Looking at the examples, we have:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 with a property value of 10.3451886. This molecule is more complex due to the presence of additional functional groups like sulfonamide and a heterocyclic ring.
- CCCCCC(=O)OC with a property value of -0.48642895. This is a simple ester with a longer alkyl chain.
- CCCCC(=O)OCC with a property value of -0.48642895. This is another simple ester with a similar structure to the target molecule.

The target molecule, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, is structurally similar to the last two examples, which are simple esters. Given the similarity in structure, particularly the ester functional group and the presence of a phenyl ring, the property value is likely to be close to those of the simple esters.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.48642895.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.036057622930764345
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached. In the examples, linear alkyl chains such as CCCCCCCCO have a property value of -0.58077518, and CI has a property value of -0.39671072. The presence of a halogen (bromine in this case) typically increases the property value compared to a similar alkane without the halogen.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be slightly higher than that of a similar alkane without the bromine. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around -0.4.

SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.9444830170067677
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for carbon monoxide (CO), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of organic and inorganic molecules with different functional groups and structural complexities. The property values range from negative to positive, indicating a spectrum of properties.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is a small, non-polar molecule with a relatively high bond order. In the context of the examples provided, simpler and smaller molecules tend to have negative property values. For instance, small hydrocarbons and simple functional groups like CCC, NC(=O)N, and CC#C have negative values.

Given this trend and the simplicity of CO, it is reasonable to predict that CO will also have a negative property value. Considering the range of negative values for small molecules in the examples, a reasonable estimate for CO would be around -0.8.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CO is approximately -0.8.
