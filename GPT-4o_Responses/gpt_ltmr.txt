SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 237.19983601726378
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a linear ester with a long carbon chain, specifically a decanoate ester.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- CCCCCCCC(=O)OC (octanoate ester) has a property value of 596.08356491.
- CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (dodecanoate ester) has a property value of 1954.17126295.

The property value seems to increase with the length of the carbon chain in the ester. The molecule CCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (decanoate ester) is between the octanoate and dodecanoate esters in terms of chain length.

Given this trend, we can estimate the property value for the decanoate ester to be between the values for the octanoate and dodecanoate esters. A reasonable prediction would be around the midpoint of these two values.

Calculating the midpoint:
(596.08356491 + 1954.17126295) / 2 = 1275.12741393

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is approximately 1275.12741393.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a fused heterocyclic ring containing an oxygen and a nitrogen atom, which is similar to some of the structures in the examples.

The examples show a range of property values for different types of molecules, with aromatic and heterocyclic compounds generally having property values that are less negative or even positive compared to simple aliphatic or halogenated hydrocarbons. The presence of chlorine atoms tends to increase the property value, as seen in several examples.

Given the structure of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, which is a chlorinated benzoxazole, we can compare it to similar structures in the examples. For instance, the molecule c1cncnc1 (pyrimidine) has a property value of -1029.58121872, and Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (hexachlorobenzene) has a property value of 180.09869085. The presence of the chlorine atom and the heterocyclic structure suggests that the property value will be less negative than simple heterocycles but not as high as highly chlorinated aromatics.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around -200.0.

Biphenyl, c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, is a relatively simple aromatic compound consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples, we have several aromatic compounds with varying degrees of complexity and substitution, and their property values vary significantly.

For instance, the molecule Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34, which is a polycyclic aromatic compound, has a property value of 1354.44211717. Another example, c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67, which is a highly complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a property value of 2196.40806358.

Given that biphenyl is simpler than these complex polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but more complex than a single benzene ring, we can estimate its property value to be lower than those of the complex polycyclic examples but higher than simpler aromatic compounds.

From the examples, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, often in the range of 400 to 1300. The presence of additional electron-withdrawing groups like trifluoromethyl can increase this value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 1200. This accounts for the electron-withdrawing effects of the nitro and trifluoromethyl groups, as well as the structural complexity of the molecule.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -1019.7482553845363
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including functional groups, chain length, and presence of heteroatoms or aromatic rings.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl acetate, an ester. In the examples, esters and similar small molecules with simple structures tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCC(C)(C)O has a property value of -852.47905543, and CCCC=O has a property value of -1070.7786145. These values suggest that small, non-aromatic molecules with simple functional groups tend to have negative property values.

Considering the structure of isopropyl acetate and comparing it to similar molecules in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around -800.0. This estimate is based on the trend observed in the examples, where small esters and similar compounds have negative values in the range of -800 to -1100.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -425.2698342947853
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to the structure of c1ccccc1O (phenol) with an additional methyl group.

The property value for phenol (c1ccccc1O) is given as -793.48127544. The addition of a methyl group generally increases the property value due to increased molecular weight and potential changes in electronic distribution.

Considering the examples, the addition of a methyl group to aromatic systems often results in a moderate increase in the property value. Therefore, we can estimate that the property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 will be slightly higher than that of phenol.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be approximately -750.0.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 908.2121361332782
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the data. The examples provided include various molecules with different functional groups and structural features, and their associated property values.

The molecule in question, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), methoxy groups (OC), and a substituted aromatic ring with a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C). We can compare this structure to similar molecules in the examples:

1. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl: 954.92842833
2. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl: 1149.91647986
3. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl: 850.38032017

These examples have a common phosphorothioate group and methoxy groups, with variations in the substituents on the aromatic ring. The presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) in these examples tends to increase the property value, with heavier halogens (I) leading to higher values.

The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 lacks halogens but includes a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C), which are less electronegative and less polarizing than halogens. Therefore, we can expect the property value to be lower than those of the halogenated examples.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 would be around 750, as it is likely to be lower than the halogenated examples but still influenced by the presence of the phosphorothioate and methoxy groups.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we can observe that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have relatively high property values. For instance:

- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1298.69349028.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1493.40948353.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is similar in structure to these examples, with multiple chlorine atoms attached to an aromatic system. Based on the trend observed, we can predict that the property value for this molecule will be in a similar range.

Considering the structural similarity and the trend in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be approximately 1400.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -1024.901816403672
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple nitroalkane, specifically nitropropane.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of nitro groups (N(=O)=O) generally increases the property value, as seen in molecules like CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O. However, the complexity and size of the molecule also play a significant role.

Given that CCCN(=O)=O is a relatively small molecule with a single nitro group, we can expect its property value to be less than those of larger, more complex nitro-containing molecules. Comparing it to simpler molecules like CCC, which has a property value of -1265.37801135, and considering the effect of the nitro group, we can estimate a property value that is slightly higher (less negative) than that of CCC.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around -1200.0.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -560.552754320492
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent. 

Let's consider the examples with similar structures:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of -364.20441142.
- COc1cccc(Cl)c1 has a property value of -408.82196836.
- Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl has a property value of 909.26150376.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but with a fluorine atom instead of a chlorine atom. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which could affect the property value. However, the presence of bromine, which is heavier and less electronegative than both chlorine and fluorine, might have a more significant impact.

Considering these factors, the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is likely to be in the same range as Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but slightly adjusted due to the presence of fluorine. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be slightly more negative than -364.20441142, but not as negative as the values for molecules with multiple halogens or more complex structures.

A reasonable estimate for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is approximately -370.0.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -127.7546789291262
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group.

Looking at the examples, we can see that the property values seem to be influenced by the size of the molecule, the presence of functional groups, and the overall complexity of the structure. For instance, larger and more complex molecules tend to have higher property values, while smaller or simpler molecules have lower values.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is relatively small and contains a tertiary alcohol group, which is similar to the structure of CCC(C)(C)O, which has a property value of -673.03719098. However, the bicyclic nature of the molecule might increase the property value slightly due to increased structural complexity.

Taking these factors into account, I would predict the property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 to be slightly higher than that of CCC(C)(C)O, but still in the negative range due to its relatively small size and lack of heavy atoms or complex functional groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 would be approximately -650.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 1867.68393764. The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of the SC(CCl) group in the example, which is not present in the molecule we are predicting for. This group likely contributes significantly to the property value due to its additional atoms and potential interactions.

Given that the molecule we are predicting for lacks this group, we can expect its property value to be lower than 1867.68393764. However, the core structure of the molecule, which includes the phosphorothioate group and the N-acylated aromatic ring, remains the same, suggesting that the property value will still be relatively high.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be slightly lower than the example with the SC(CCl) group. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 1500.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule CN2C(=C(O)c1ccccc1S2(=O)=O)C(=O)Nc3ccccn3, which has a property value of 1371.30584361. However, the example molecule is more complex with additional functional groups and a larger structure.

Another example, Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, has a property value of 1099.5468337. This molecule also contains a nitrogen heterocycle and a carbonyl group, similar to the target molecule, but it is more complex due to the additional aromatic ring and substituents.

Considering the complexity and the types of functional groups present in the target molecule, it is likely to have a property value lower than the more complex examples but higher than simpler structures like Cc1cccc(C)c1C, which has a property value of -305.86734438.

Based on these comparisons, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around 800.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate. 

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Simple alkanes like CCCCC (pentane) have a property value of -906.49428246.
2. Esters like CCCCCC(=O)OC (methyl hexanoate) have a property value of 57.75797157.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar to the ester example, but with a longer carbon chain. The property value for esters seems to be positive and increases with the length of the carbon chain. Given that CCCCCCC(=O)OCC has a longer chain than CCCCCC(=O)OC, we can expect its property value to be slightly higher than 57.75797157.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around 100.0.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Esters like CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 have a property value of -173.32443983.
2. The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, which is ethyl benzoate, has a property value of -238.02767048.

Given that methyl benzoate is structurally similar to ethyl benzoate but with a slightly smaller alkyl group, we can expect its property value to be slightly less negative than that of ethyl benzoate due to the smaller size and mass of the methyl group compared to the ethyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 (methyl benzoate) would be slightly less negative than -238.02767048. A predicted value could be around -230.0.

Looking at the examples, simpler hydrocarbons and small molecules tend to have more negative property values. For instance, CC/C=C/C (a linear alkene) has a property value of -910.14763643, and CCC(C)(C)CC (a branched alkane) has a property value of -550.33113631. The property values for these simpler hydrocarbons are negative and relatively large in magnitude.

Given that C=CCC=C is a small, unsaturated hydrocarbon, we can expect its property value to be negative and possibly in the range of the simpler hydrocarbons provided. Considering the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C would be around -800.0.

In the examples provided, simpler molecules with halogen atoms tend to have lower property values. For instance, the molecule FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br has a property value of -928.88079186, and Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of 16.910365.

Given the simplicity and the presence of three bromine atoms, we can expect the property value for BrC(Br)Br to be relatively low, similar to other simple halogenated compounds. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around -900.

- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, have relatively high property values (e.g., 1799.94142741).
- The presence of aromatic rings and halogen substituents (Cl) tends to increase the property value.
- The presence of multiple functional groups, such as amides and esters, also contributes to higher property values.

Considering these factors, the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is likely to have a relatively high property value due to the combination of a phosphorothioate group, aromatic rings, and multiple functional groups.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 1800.0.

- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1ccc(c(Cl)c1))
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle (n2nc(oc2=O))
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with amide groups, such as CN(C)C(=O)C, have values around -938.79.
- Chlorinated aromatic rings, like Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, have values around -404.84.
- Heterocycles with nitrogen and oxygen, like Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O), have values around 371.67.
- The presence of a tert-butyl group, as in CCC(C)C, has a value around -909.21.

Considering these components and their potential interactions, the molecule is likely to have a property value that reflects the combined effects of these groups. The presence of the heterocycle and the tert-butyl group might increase the value compared to simpler structures, while the chlorinated aromatic ring might decrease it.

Given that Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has two aromatic rings and three chlorine atoms, it is likely to have a property value that is somewhat similar to these examples. Considering the additional ether linkage, which might slightly increase the property value, a reasonable prediction would be around the midpoint of the range observed for similar structures.

Therefore, a predicted property value for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl could be approximately 100.

This structure is somewhat similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 1416.41699199. Both molecules contain a tertiary amide linkage and two phenyl rings, although the example has an additional heterocyclic component.

Another similar example is C(Cc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 457.4115761. This molecule also contains two phenyl rings but lacks the amide linkage.

Considering the structural similarities and the presence of the amide group, which tends to increase the property value, the predicted property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be between the values of the two examples mentioned above.

- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents (e.g., Fc1cccc(Br)c1, Clc1cccc(Cl)c1) tend to have property values in the range of -500 to -600.
- The presence of an amide group (as in CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1) can influence the property value, as seen in other amide-containing molecules like CN(C)C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to be in the range of -500 to -600. Given the specific structure and the influence of the bromine and amide group, a reasonable estimate would be around -550.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. The presence of a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) generally contributes a certain baseline to the property value. For instance, toluene (Cc1ccccc1) has a property value of -502.58879577.

2. The addition of alkyl groups to the benzene ring tends to increase the property value. For example, ethylbenzene (CCc1ccccc1) has a property value of -309.59842928, which is higher than that of toluene.

3. The presence of additional carbon atoms in the alkyl chain further increases the property value. For instance, propylbenzene (CCCc1ccccc1) would likely have a higher property value than ethylbenzene.

Given these observations, isobutylbenzene (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1) should have a property value higher than that of ethylbenzene but potentially lower than a more heavily substituted benzene derivative.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with functional groups such as carbonyls (C=O) tend to have negative property values. For instance, NC(=O)c1ccccc1O has a property value of -462.42910798, and COc1ccccc1 has a property value of -603.53796161. These examples suggest that the presence of a carbonyl group in an aromatic compound contributes to a negative property value.

Considering the structure of benzaldehyde and the trends observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for O=Cc1ccccc1 will also be negative.

In the examples, molecules with nitro groups and heterocycles tend to have property values that are either moderately positive or negative, depending on the specific structure and other functional groups present.

For instance, the molecule Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 has a property value of 820.43059075, which is relatively high, likely due to the presence of multiple aromatic rings and nitro groups. On the other hand, simpler structures with fewer aromatic systems and functional groups tend to have lower or negative values.

Considering the complexity of the given molecule, with its heterocyclic structure and nitro group, it is likely to have a moderately positive property value. However, it is not as complex as some of the higher-valued examples, so it should be lower than those.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be around 300.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 451.09205104526615
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a diaryl hydrazine, which is structurally similar to the example N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 331.79838444.

The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of a double-bonded nitrogen in the example molecule, which is not present in the molecule we are predicting. This structural change could affect the property value, likely making it less positive or more negative due to the absence of the double bond, which can influence electronic properties and stability.

Considering the structural similarity and the effect of the double bond, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be slightly lower than 331.79838444. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 300.0.

True Property: -230.88031096664938
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is a bicyclic compound with two amide groups and a cyclopentane ring. This structure is similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, which has a property value of 386.88629838. Both molecules contain cyclic structures with amide groups, but the example has additional alkyl groups that may increase the property value.

Considering the structural similarities and the absence of additional alkyl groups in the target molecule, the property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be lower than 386.88629838. However, it should still be positive due to the presence of the cyclic and amide structures.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately 300.0.

True Property: 714.5455105046593
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. The presence of chlorine atoms generally contributes to a more negative property value.
2. The biphenyl structure (two connected benzene rings) is present in some examples, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, which has a property value of 1419.13757473. This example has a more complex structure with additional chlorine atoms and a trichloromethyl group, leading to a higher property value.
3. Simpler chlorinated aromatic compounds, such as Clc1ccccc1Cl, have a more negative property value of -468.75251958.

Given that Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a simpler structure compared to the more complex chlorinated biphenyl with a trichloromethyl group, we can expect its property value to be less positive than 1419.13757473 but more negative than -468.75251958.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around -200.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -129.223793608789
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically 1,3-diethylbenzene.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Simple aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions tend to have negative property values. For instance, Cc1ccccc1N has a property value of -502.58879577, and Cc1ccccn1 has a property value of -579.40250616.

2. The presence of additional alkyl groups generally results in a less negative property value compared to simpler aromatic compounds. For example, CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 has a property value of 224.06330793, which is positive due to the long alkyl chain.

3. The property values seem to be influenced by the size and complexity of the molecule, with larger and more complex molecules having higher (less negative or positive) values.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a relatively simple aromatic compound with two ethyl groups, it is likely to have a property value that is negative but not as negative as simpler aromatic compounds without additional alkyl groups.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be around -400.

To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a sulfonamide derivative, which is similar to nitrobenzene derivatives in terms of having an electron-withdrawing group attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that nitrobenzene derivatives, such as Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -428.06814797. The presence of the sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is somewhat similar in electronic effect to the nitro group (N(=O)=O), as both are strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Given this similarity, we can predict that the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O will be in a similar range to that of nitrobenzene derivatives. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be approximately -428.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically triphenylene. It consists of four fused benzene rings, forming a planar, aromatic structure. In the examples, similar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 and c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54, have property values of 1367.05784799 and 1452.05662588, respectively.

Triphenylene is structurally similar to these examples, but it is slightly smaller and less complex than the example with the highest property value. Therefore, we can predict that the property value for triphenylene will be slightly lower than 1452.05662588 but higher than 1367.05784799.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of triphenylene (c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34) is approximately 1400.

Predicting the property value for the given molecule, Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule appears to be a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group, similar to some of the higher property value examples.

The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group suggests a relatively high property value, as seen in other complex aromatic structures with similar functional groups. Based on the examples, particularly those with multiple aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 1500.0. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 is approximately 1500.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a thiophosphate ester with an acetamide group.

1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains a thiophosphate group (P(=O)(OC)S) and an acetamide group (NC(C)=O). These groups are similar to those found in some of the examples, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl and COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl.

2. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - The example COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of 850.38032017. This molecule has a thiophosphate group and aromatic chlorinated rings.
   - The example COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of 1146.08823129. This molecule has a phosphate group and chlorinated aromatic rings.

3. **Structural Complexity**: The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is less complex than the examples with chlorinated aromatic rings. It lacks the aromatic and halogenated components, which tend to increase the property value.

4. **Prediction**: Given the simpler structure and the presence of a thiophosphate group, the property value is expected to be lower than the examples with aromatic chlorinated rings. However, it should still be positive due to the presence of the thiophosphate group.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around 500.

SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: -1075.6756634277997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, simple molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with halogen atoms, particularly chlorine, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1298.69349028, and Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of -404.04928892. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms seems to increase the property value.

Given that Cl\C=C/Cl is a small molecule with two chlorine atoms, we can expect its property value to be relatively low compared to larger, more complex chlorinated compounds. However, it should still be positive due to the presence of the chlorine atoms.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around 100 to 200. However, without a more specific pattern or formula, this is a rough estimate. Let's choose a value within this range:

Predicted property value for Cl\C=C/Cl: 150.

True Property: -943.8828624029861
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, aromaticity, and heteroatoms.

Pyridine is an aromatic heterocyclic compound with a nitrogen atom in the ring, similar to benzene but with one carbon replaced by nitrogen. In the examples, aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as CNc1ccccc1 (aniline), have a property value of -487.14754545, and heterocyclic compounds like COc2ncc1nccnc1n2 (a purine derivative) have a property value of -265.95250903.

Considering pyridine's structure and comparing it to similar aromatic and heterocyclic compounds in the examples, we can estimate that its property value will be in a similar range. Given that pyridine is a simple aromatic heterocycle with one nitrogen, its property value is likely to be slightly less negative than aniline but more negative than the purine derivative.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of pyridine (c1ccncc1) is approximately -400.0.

The molecule contains several functional groups and structural motifs that can influence its property value, such as:

1. An ester group (OC(=O)).
2. An aromatic ring system with a chlorine substituent.
3. A secondary amine linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23).
4. A polycyclic aromatic system.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple aromatic rings, the property value is likely to be relatively high compared to simpler molecules. The presence of chlorine and the aromatic systems suggest a property value in the positive range, similar to other complex aromatic systems in the examples.

Based on these considerations and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 would be approximately 800.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the degree of unsaturation or aromaticity.

The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol with five carbon atoms and one hydroxyl group. It is similar in structure to other linear alkanes and alcohols in the examples, such as CCCCC(=O)CCCC, which has a property value of -173.56929227. The presence of the hydroxyl group in CCCCCO may slightly increase the property value compared to a similar alkane without the hydroxyl group.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be slightly higher than that of a similar linear alkane. Therefore, I would predict the property value for CCCCCO to be approximately:

True Property: 737.9619548035242
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a sulfonamide with a benzene ring, a carbonyl group, and an ether linkage. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Sulfonamide Group (S(=O)(=O)N)**: This functional group is known to contribute significantly to the molecular property due to its polar nature and the presence of multiple electronegative atoms (oxygen and nitrogen).

2. **Benzene Ring (c2ccccc2)**: Aromatic rings are common in the examples and typically contribute to a moderate property value, often positive due to their stability and resonance.

3. **Carbonyl Group (C=O)**: This group is also polar and can contribute to the property value, often making it more negative due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

4. **Ether Linkage (CCO)**: Ethers are generally less polar than carbonyls and sulfonamides, but they can still influence the property value, often slightly negatively.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, particularly those with similar functional groups and aromatic systems, we can estimate the property value. The presence of the sulfonamide and carbonyl groups suggests a more negative contribution, while the aromatic ring might offset this to some extent.

Based on the examples, particularly those with sulfonamide and aromatic systems, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be around -200 to -300. Given the specific structure and the examples provided, a more precise estimate would be:

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:
- An ester group (COC(=O))
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring
- A bicyclic structure with a nitrogen atom in the ring
- Multiple carbonyl groups

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, have relatively high property values (1128.06631391).
- Molecules with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups, such as CC1=C(CCCO1)C(=O)Nc2ccccc2, also have high property values (561.01525339).
- The presence of ester groups, as seen in CCCCC(=O)OC, tends to lower the property value (-660.00948621).

Considering these factors, the molecule in question is likely to have a relatively high property value due to the combination of aromatic, nitro, and carbonyl groups, despite the presence of ester groups which might slightly lower the value.

Based on the structural analysis and comparison with the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately 1200.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) and nitrogen atoms in amide linkages tends to contribute negatively to the property value. Additionally, smaller ring systems like cyclopropane can also influence the property value.

Given these considerations and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around -700.0. This is an estimation based on the trends observed in the provided data.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure, consisting of a chloroethane (ethyl chloride) group. In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules tend to have more negative property values. For instance, CCCCCC (hexane) has a property value of -906.49428246, and Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) has a property value of -663.46851283. These examples suggest that smaller, less complex molecules with halogen atoms tend to have negative property values.

Given the simplicity and small size of ClCC, along with the presence of a chlorine atom, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Based on the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be around -1000.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a pyridine ring and a trichloromethyl group. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms and an aromatic ring suggests that the property value might be influenced by the electron-withdrawing nature of the chlorine atoms and the aromatic system.

Looking at the examples, we see that chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values, as seen with Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (714.5455105) and Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2 (325.11352399). The presence of additional chlorine atoms, as in Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (1419.13757473), further increases the property value.

Given these observations, the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is expected to have a property value that is positive and likely higher than the simpler chlorinated aromatics but lower than the highly chlorinated example with multiple aromatic rings.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl would be around 800.

The molecule CCCCC(C)O is a branched alcohol, specifically 2-hexanol. In the examples, we have several alcohols and similar structures:

1. CCCCC(O)CCC, -493.59532654
2. CCC(C)CCO, -674.90273343

Both of these examples are alcohols with similar chain lengths and branching patterns. The property values for these alcohols are negative, indicating a trend for alcohols with similar structures.

Given that CCCCC(C)O is a branched alcohol with a similar structure to the examples provided, we can predict that its property value will also be negative and likely fall within the range of the examples provided. Considering the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCC(C)O would be approximately -500.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is 1,4-dibromobenzene, which is a simple aromatic compound with two bromine atoms attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have property values that are influenced by the presence and number of halogen atoms. For instance, ClCCl (dichloromethane) has a property value of -1241.74780698, and ClC(Cl)Cl (chloroform) has a property value of -1056.2040641. These values are negative, indicating a certain trend for chlorinated compounds.

For aromatic compounds with halogens, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl (1,2-dichlorobenzene), the property value is 519.82951725. This suggests that the presence of halogens on an aromatic ring can lead to positive property values.

Considering the structure of 1,4-dibromobenzene and the trends observed in the examples, we can predict that the property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 will be positive and likely in a similar range to other halogenated aromatic compounds. Given the presence of two bromine atoms, which are heavier than chlorine atoms, the property value might be slightly higher than that of dichlorobenzene.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately 600.

The examples suggest that the property values are related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of halogens and aromatic rings.

The molecule in question, Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl, is a chlorinated biphenyl with multiple chlorine atoms.

Given the structure of the molecule:
- It contains three aromatic rings, which are similar to the aromatic structures in some of the examples.
- The presence of the phosphate group is a unique feature compared to the examples, but it can be considered similar to other polar functional groups like carbonyls and nitro groups.
- The molecule is relatively large and complex, similar to some of the higher property value examples.

Considering these factors, the property value is likely to be on the higher end of the spectrum, similar to other large, aromatic, and polar molecules in the examples.

True Property: -344.91159324527007
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a nitrobenzene derivative with a methoxy group, which can be represented as a methoxybenzene (anisole) with a nitro group attached.

From the examples, we can identify some relevant molecules:
- O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (dinitrobenzene) has a property value of -340.93176935.
- c1ccccc1O (phenol) has a property value of -793.48127544.
- Cc1cccc(C)c1 (toluene) has a property value of -489.97306495.

The molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is similar to a combination of anisole and nitrobenzene. Anisole itself is not directly listed, but we can infer its property value by considering the effect of the methoxy group, which is electron-donating, and the nitro group, which is electron-withdrawing.

Given the examples, the presence of the nitro group tends to increase the property value (less negative), while the methoxy group might slightly decrease it (more negative) compared to a simple benzene derivative. The property value for nitrobenzene would likely be between that of phenol and dinitrobenzene.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around -500.0. This value reflects the balance between the electron-donating methoxy group and the electron-withdrawing nitro group, resulting in a property value that is less negative than phenol but more negative than dinitrobenzene.

True Property: 1270.6326225845855
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them with the examples provided. The molecule is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, which suggests it might have a high molecular weight and potentially a high property value due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, have relatively high property values (e.g., 362.34664206). The given molecule is even more heavily chlorinated, which suggests that its property value might be higher than the example provided.

Considering these factors, I would predict the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl to be approximately 500.0.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -1018.8932150947851
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is a simple ester, specifically propyl formate.

Looking at the examples, simpler molecules with fewer functional groups and lower molecular weights tend to have more negative property values. For instance, CC#N has a property value of -1447.19066932, and CCC#C has a property value of -1142.60199883. These are small molecules with triple bonds, which might contribute to their more negative values.

The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, which is generally less polar than nitriles or alkynes, and it is also larger than the smallest examples provided. However, it is still relatively small and simple compared to many of the larger, more complex molecules with positive property values.

Considering these factors, CCCOC=O is likely to have a negative property value, but not as negative as the smallest, most polar examples. A reasonable estimate, based on the trend of increasing negativity with simplicity and small size, would be around -500 to -600.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCOC=O could be approximately -550.

True Property: 416.64170046184205
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a simple ester, specifically decanoic acid ethyl ester, which is a long-chain fatty acid ester.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with long hydrocarbon chains, such as CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 (224.06330793) and CCCCCC=C(CC)C=O (-356.66451068), tend to have property values in the range of a few hundred, either positive or negative.

2. The presence of an ester functional group, as seen in CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C (2363.02432368), can significantly increase the property value, but this is also influenced by the complexity and size of the molecule.

3. Simpler esters or molecules with fewer functional groups, such as CCCO (not directly listed but similar to CCOC, -1024.33438058), tend to have lower property values.

Considering these observations, the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is a relatively simple ester with a long hydrocarbon chain. It is expected to have a property value that is not extremely high or low, likely in the range of a few hundred, similar to other long-chain hydrocarbons or simple esters.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be approximately 200.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to the aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have negative property values.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, also tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of chlorine atoms in aromatic rings, as seen in Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, results in a positive property value.

Considering these observations, the molecule in question has a combination of features that could lead to a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero, given the balance between the positive influence of chlorine atoms and the negative influence of the nitro and amide groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be around -100.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them with the examples provided. The molecule contains two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are similar to the phosphorothioate group in the example molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 1799.94142741. 

The given molecule also has two aromatic rings connected by a sulfur atom, which is a feature that can contribute to the overall property value. The presence of multiple aromatic rings and the phosphorothioate groups suggests a relatively high property value, similar to the example with a high value.

Considering these structural similarities and the high property value of the example with a phosphorothioate group, I predict that the property value for the given molecule is approximately 1800.

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -534.8549070667005
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can identify some similar structures:
- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which is nitrotoluene, has a property value of -415.45241715.
- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, which is a chlorinated phenol, has a property value of -209.33329566.

The presence of the nitro group in the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is similar to the nitrotoluene example, but the hydroxyl group in the phenol is an electron-donating group, which can affect the property value. The combination of these functional groups suggests that the property value might be slightly more negative than that of nitrotoluene due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group being somewhat counteracted by the electron-donating effect of the hydroxyl group.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be around -430.0.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. The molecule appears to be a complex carbohydrate, likely a polysaccharide or a similar structure with multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages.

From the examples, it seems that the property values are influenced by the molecular complexity, presence of functional groups, and overall molecular size. Larger and more complex molecules with multiple functional groups tend to have higher property values, while smaller or simpler molecules, especially those with fewer functional groups, tend to have lower or negative values.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, which are polar and can contribute to a higher property value, I would predict that the property value for this molecule is relatively high. However, it is not as high as the most complex aromatic or halogenated compounds in the examples.

Based on this reasoning, I would estimate the property value for the given molecule to be approximately 1500.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -1142.601998834679
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne, with a terminal triple bond.

Looking at the examples, we can see that linear alkanes and alkenes tend to have negative property values, often related to their size and degree of unsaturation. For instance, the linear alkene CCCCCCCCCCCCCC=O has a property value of -711.89488561, and the linear alkane CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO has a property value of 1481.12022264. The presence of a triple bond, as in CCC#C, introduces more unsaturation compared to alkanes and alkenes, which generally results in a more negative property value.

Considering the examples and the nature of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around -800.0. This accounts for the unsaturation and the relatively small size of the molecule compared to the larger examples provided.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 1799.94142741.
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to the example Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of 1298.69349028.

Considering these structural similarities, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms, and the phosphorothioate group, the property value is likely to be influenced by both the electron-withdrawing effects of the chlorine atoms and the presence of the P=S group.

Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl would be around 1500, as it shares features with both the phosphorothioate and chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately 1500.

To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a pyridine derivative with a hydrazide group attached to the carbonyl.

1. **Aromatic Ring**: The molecule contains a pyridine ring, which is similar to the aromatic rings in several examples. Aromatic rings generally contribute to a moderate property value, often positive or slightly negative.

2. **Carbonyl Group**: The presence of a carbonyl group (C=O) is common in several examples, such as COc1ccc(C=O)cc1, which has a property value of -394.15025429. Carbonyl groups can contribute to a more negative property value.

3. **Hydrazide Group**: The hydrazide group (C(=O)NN) is a polar functional group, which can influence the property value. The presence of nitrogen atoms, as seen in examples like Nc1cccc2ccccc12 (-6.3156385), can lead to a less negative or slightly positive property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero, due to the balance between the aromatic ring, carbonyl group, and the polar hydrazide group.

Based on the analysis of the examples and the structural features of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be approximately:

The property values seem to be related to some form of energy or stability measure, possibly related to molecular weight, functional groups, and overall molecular complexity.

The molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C contains several functional groups and structural features:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCCC)S)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, this molecule is likely to have a relatively high property value compared to simpler molecules. For instance, molecules with complex structures and multiple functional groups like CCN2c1cc(N(C)C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23 (1626.64807996) and CC(C)=CC3C(C(=O)OCc2cccc(Oc1ccccc1)c2)C3(C)C (2115.17923605) have high property values.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of a phosphorothioate group, which is not present in the examples but adds to the molecular weight and complexity, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around 1500.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -368.16868912650006
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (octane), we can analyze the trends in the provided examples. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of functional groups, rings, and the overall size of the molecule.

For linear alkanes, the property values tend to be negative and decrease (become more negative) with increasing chain length. For instance, the property value for CCCCCCCO (heptanol) is -492.74028625, and for CCCCC/C=C/C (octene) is -551.26390754. These values suggest that the property value for octane, which is a simple linear alkane without additional functional groups, should be in a similar range but slightly more negative due to the absence of functional groups like alcohols or double bonds.

Considering these trends, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCC (octane) is approximately -600.0.

Predicting the property value for a molecule based on the given examples involves identifying patterns and trends in the molecular structures and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the complexity and specific functional groups present in the molecules.

The molecule in question, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbonyl group (C=O), as well as a triple bond (C#C).

Based on the examples provided, molecules with complex polycyclic structures and multiple functional groups tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO has a property value of 1998.52064816, and CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O has a property value of 1328.96191653.

Considering the complexity and the presence of functional groups in the given molecule, I would predict a property value in a similar range to these complex structures. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is approximately:

The given molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings. The presence of methoxy groups (OC) and hydroxyl groups (O) suggests some degree of polarity, while the polycyclic nature and aromatic rings contribute to its stability and potential for high property values.

From the examples, we observe that complex polycyclic structures with multiple rings and heteroatoms tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21 has a property value of 2700.21334849, which is quite high due to its complex structure and multiple rings.

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some form of energy or stability measure.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to the nitrophenol example Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O with a property value of -534.85490707. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, while the chloro group is also electron-withdrawing but less so than the nitro group. Additionally, the molecular weight of chlorophenol is less than that of nitrophenol due to the difference between the nitro and chloro groups.

Considering these factors, the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl should be less negative than that of nitrophenol, reflecting the weaker electron-withdrawing effect and lower molecular weight. A reasonable estimate for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around -500.0.

- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2) attached to the central carbon.
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have higher property values.

- ClC(Cl)=C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2, which has a property value of 1247.93518944.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents, the property value is likely to be on the higher side. However, the presence of the pyrimidine ring and the phenol group may moderate this value.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl would be approximately 1100.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with benzene rings and hydroxyl groups, such as Oc1cccc(O)c1, have a property value of -728.77804478.
- Molecules with benzene rings and methyl groups, such as CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, have a property value of -61.79998022.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is similar to these examples, as it contains both a methyl group and a hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring. The presence of the hydroxyl group typically has a more significant impact on the property value, as seen in the example of Oc1cccc(O)c1.

Considering these factors, the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is likely to be closer to the value of Oc1cccc(O)c1, but slightly adjusted due to the presence of the methyl group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be around -61.79998022, as it is more similar to the example with both a methyl and hydroxyl group.

- Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1103.97749702.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1298.69349028.

The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a biphenyl with four chlorine atoms, similar to the second example, which has a higher property value due to the additional chlorine atoms compared to the first example.

Given the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl would be slightly lower than 1298.69349028 but higher than 1103.97749702, as it has fewer chlorine atoms than the second example but more than the first.

Looking at the examples, we notice that simple hydrocarbons and those with similar structural features tend to have negative property values. For instance:

- CCCCC(CC)C=O has a property value of -355.73173946.
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 has a property value of -126.50321087.
- CCCCCCCC=C has a property value of -12.9383142.
- CCCCCCCC has a property value of -368.16868913.

These examples suggest that hydrocarbons with more complex structures or additional functional groups tend to have more negative values, while simpler hydrocarbons or those with fewer functional groups have less negative values.

Given that CC=C(C)C is a relatively simple hydrocarbon with a double bond and a branched structure, it is likely to have a property value that is negative but not as extreme as those with more complex structures or additional functional groups.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around -50.0.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -1241.747806978088
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some form of energy or stability measure.

Dichloromethane is a small, simple molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules tend to have more negative property values. For instance, ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of -702.8780971, and it is a more complex chlorinated compound than dichloromethane.

Given the simplicity and small size of ClCCl compared to the other chlorinated compounds in the examples, we can predict that its property value will be more negative than those of larger, more complex chlorinated molecules.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around -800, considering its simplicity and the trend observed in the examples.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -209.33329566492247
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of chlorine atoms generally contributes to a more negative property value. For instance, the molecule Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of -209.33329566. This molecule is 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene, which is structurally similar to 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, except for the hydroxyl group replacing one hydrogen.

The presence of the hydroxyl group in phenols typically results in a more negative property value compared to the corresponding chlorinated benzene, due to the increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding. Therefore, we can expect the property value for 2,4,6-trichlorophenol to be slightly more negative than that of 1,3,5-trichlorobenzene.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl (2,4,6-trichlorophenol) would be slightly more negative than -209.33329566. A predicted value could be around -220.0.

True Property: 3490.9934739166347
Predicted Property:
Predicting the specific property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known molecules and their properties.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as aromatic and aliphatic components. The presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (methoxy, hydroxyl, and ether groups) and the polycyclic aromatic system suggests a relatively high molecular weight and complexity.

From the examples provided, molecules with high molecular weights and complex structures, such as polycyclic aromatic compounds and those with multiple functional groups, tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule with the highest property value in the examples is a large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a value of 1858.58941819.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups in the target molecule, it is reasonable to predict a relatively high property value. However, without specific information on the nature of the property being measured, this prediction is based on structural complexity and comparison to similar examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule could be around 1500 to 1800, considering its structural complexity and the trend observed in the examples. A specific prediction could be approximately 1650.

To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a thiosemicarbazone derivative with a tert-butyl group.

1. **Molecular Complexity**: The molecule has a thiosemicarbazone core, which is a common motif in several examples. The presence of a tert-butyl group adds steric bulk, similar to some of the larger molecules in the examples.

2. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains a thiocarbonyl group (C=S), an amide linkage (N-C=O), and a tert-butyl group. These functional groups are present in various forms in the examples, contributing to the overall property value.

3. **Comparison with Examples**: 
   - The molecule CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a similar complexity and functional group arrangement, with a property value of 645.0851466.
   - The presence of a thiocarbonyl group and a tert-butyl group suggests a property value in a similar range.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is approximately **645.0**.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -238.02767047961353
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is ethyl benzoate, which is an ester derived from benzoic acid and ethanol.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds, especially those with benzene rings, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which is diphenyl ether, has a property value of 172.37223587. Similarly, the molecule c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12, which is bromonaphthalene, has a property value of 121.45847316.

Ethyl benzoate is structurally similar to these aromatic compounds, as it contains a benzene ring. However, it also has an ester functional group, which might slightly alter the property value compared to simple aromatic hydrocarbons.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be slightly positive, reflecting the influence of the aromatic ring and the ester group. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a predicted property value for ethyl benzoate could be around 50.0.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -232.02295571749863
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are related to the molecular structure, particularly the types of atoms, functional groups, and overall molecular size.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom at the end. This structure is similar to the example Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which has a property value of 121.45847316. However, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is an aromatic compound, while CCCCCCCBr is an aliphatic compound. The presence of bromine in both molecules suggests that the bromine atom contributes significantly to the property value.

Additionally, the example CCCCCCCCO has a property value of -492.74028625, which is a linear alkyl chain with an alcohol group. The presence of the bromine atom in CCCCCCCBr, which is more electronegative than the oxygen in the alcohol group, might result in a different property value.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be between the values for Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 and CCCCCCCCO. Given the linear nature and the presence of bromine, a reasonable estimate for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around -300.0.

SMILES: CO
True Property: -1569.3914729171572
Predicted Property:
Predicting the specific property value for carbon monoxide (CO) based on the given examples is challenging without knowing the exact nature of the property being measured. The examples provided include a wide range of molecular structures with associated numerical values, but without additional context, it's difficult to determine the property being predicted (e.g., energy, enthalpy, or another thermodynamic or molecular property).

However, given that the examples include both positive and negative values, it suggests that the property could be related to energy or stability, where more negative values might indicate more stable or lower energy states.

Carbon monoxide is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen, making it quite stable. In the context of energy-related properties, simpler and smaller molecules often have less negative values compared to larger, more complex molecules.

Based on this reasoning and the range of values provided, a rough estimate for the property value of CO could be around -1100.0. This is a speculative estimate, as the exact property and its calculation method are not specified.
