SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.3967430043991601
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The molecule is a long-chain ester, similar to the example CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which has a property value of 0.56571472. The difference between the two molecules is the length of the carbon chain; the given molecule has one less carbon in the chain.

From the examples, it seems that longer carbon chains in esters tend to have slightly higher property values. Therefore, we can expect the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC to be slightly lower than 0.56571472.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be approximately 0.5.

True Property: -0.5520952765663678
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxygen and nitrogen atom in a five-membered ring. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings and heteroatoms.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups (like Cl) tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of heteroatoms like oxygen and nitrogen in a ring can also contribute to a negative property value, as seen in some examples.

Considering these factors, the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of chlorine (an electron-withdrawing group) and the heterocyclic structure with oxygen and nitrogen.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around -0.5.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.0784956081736767
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O). The presence of the nitro group is significant because it is an electron-withdrawing group, which can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have negative property values. Additionally, the presence of alkyl groups like isopropyl (CC(C)) tends to have a less pronounced effect compared to the nitro group.

Considering these factors, the property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative, similar to other nitro-containing compounds in the examples. Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O would be approximately -0.6.

CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO

This molecule is a complex polycyclic structure with multiple rings and carbonyl groups. It resembles steroid-like structures, which are often associated with high property values due to their large, rigid frameworks and multiple functional groups.

Looking at the examples, the molecule "CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C" has a property value of 7.74187144. This molecule is also a polycyclic structure with carbonyl groups, similar to the one we are analyzing.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of multiple rings and carbonyl groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for the given molecule will be in a similar range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule "CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO" is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A difluorobenzene moiety (Fc1cccc(F)c1), which is similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 with a property value of -0.06147195.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N), which is a common feature in several molecules with negative property values.
- A chlorobenzene moiety (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), which is similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of -0.25478014.

Considering these components, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is negative, as both the difluorobenzene and chlorobenzene moieties in the examples have negative values. The presence of the amide linkage, which is also associated with negative values, further supports this.

Taking into account the structural similarities and the property values of the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be around -0.3. 

Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately -0.3.

True Property: -0.1993876030716308
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with a linear chain and a branching methyl group. It is similar in structure to other small aliphatic ethers and alcohols in the examples, such as CCCC(C)CO (-0.2245963) and CCCCCO (0.13835058). These molecules have relatively low property values, likely due to their aliphatic nature and lack of strong polar or aromatic groups.

Considering the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is likely to be slightly negative, reflecting its aliphatic ether nature without significant polar or aromatic influence.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C is approximately -0.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a substituted pyrrole with two carbonyl groups and a bromine atom.

1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**: 
   - The molecule contains a pyrrole ring, which is a five-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen atom.
   - It has two carbonyl groups (=O) attached to the pyrrole ring, which can influence the electronic properties.
   - There is a bromine atom (Br) attached to the ring, which is a halogen and can affect the molecule's polarity and reactivity.
   - There is an alkyl chain (CCC(C)) attached to the nitrogen, which can increase hydrophobicity.

2. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - Molecules with halogens and carbonyl groups, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (-0.25478014) and CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.74650214), tend to have negative property values.
   - The presence of a pyrrole ring, as seen in Nc1nccs1 (0.24528625), can contribute to a slightly positive or neutral property value, but the additional carbonyl groups and bromine may shift this towards a negative value.

3. **Overall Prediction**:
   - Considering the presence of electron-withdrawing groups (carbonyls and bromine) and the aromatic nature of the pyrrole, the property value is likely to be negative.
   - The alkyl chain may slightly mitigate the negativity, but not enough to make it positive.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O would be around -0.5.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -0.7550821815025827
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of aromatic rings and substituents.

Biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) is a simple aromatic compound consisting of two connected phenyl rings. In the examples, molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have higher property values, especially when they are fused or connected in a way that increases conjugation or electron delocalization.

For instance, the molecule Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34, which is a polycyclic aromatic compound, has a property value of 0.63499775. Another example, c1cc2ccc3ccc4ccc5ccc6ccc1c7c2c3c4c5c67, which is a highly conjugated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a much higher property value of 4.49665138.

Given that biphenyl is less complex than these polycyclic examples but still consists of two aromatic rings, its property value is likely to be positive but not as high as the more complex polycyclic structures. It is reasonable to predict that the property value for biphenyl would be closer to the lower end of the positive range observed for simpler aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) is approximately 0.5.

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.0059558658010702556
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCCCCS is a linear alkane chain with a sulfur atom at the end, which is similar to the structure of alkanes and thiols.

From the examples, we observe that linear alkanes like CCCCCCC=C have negative property values, such as -0.74889824. The presence of a sulfur atom, as in thiols, can influence the property value, but the examples do not provide a direct comparison for a simple thiol.

Considering the general trend of alkanes having negative property values and the potential influence of the sulfur atom, we can predict that CCCCCS will also have a negative property value, likely in the range of the other linear alkanes.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS is approximately -0.7.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol, specifically 2-methyl-2-butanol. In the examples, we have several aliphatic and branched hydrocarbons, as well as alcohols, which can help us make a prediction:

1. CCC(C)(C)C (2,2-dimethylbutane) has a property value of 0.09998256.
2. CCCC(C)(O)CC (a similar branched alcohol) has a property value of -0.51391697.
3. CC(C)CC(C)O (a similar alcohol) has a property value of -0.13216489.

The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) in alcohols generally tends to lower the property value compared to similar hydrocarbons without the OH group. Given the examples, the property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is likely to be negative and closer to the values of similar alcohols.

Considering these points, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO would be around -0.5. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 with a property value of -0.49026399
- Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 with a property value of -0.76599624

Both of these examples are similar in that they are naphthalene derivatives with additional methyl groups. The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is structurally similar to these examples but lacks the additional complexity of extra methyl groups or other substituents.

Given the structural similarity to these examples, particularly Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1, which is a naphthalene derivative with a similar level of substitution, we can predict that the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 will be close to these values.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately -0.5.

The given molecule is a cyclic compound with a urea-like structure, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -0.69687824. The main difference between the two structures is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the given molecule.

The addition of an alkyl chain generally increases hydrophobicity, which might slightly increase the property value compared to the example. However, the overall structure and functional groups remain similar, suggesting that the property value will not deviate significantly from the example.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be slightly higher than -0.69687824, but still negative due to the presence of the urea-like structure.

This molecule is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Cyclic Structure**: The molecule contains multiple fused rings, similar to some of the examples provided, such as CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of 10.16138853. This suggests that complex cyclic structures with multiple rings tend to have higher property values.

2. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains ketone groups (C=O) and an ester group (CC(=O)O). These functional groups are also present in some of the examples, such as CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O, which has a property value of -0.72673506. However, the presence of multiple ketone groups and the ester linkage might contribute to a higher property value.

3. **Hydroxyl Groups**: The presence of hydroxyl groups (C3(O) and C(O)) can influence the property value. In the example CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C, which has a property value of 6.62571863, the presence of hydroxyl groups in a complex cyclic structure contributes to a higher property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule in question has a complex structure with multiple rings, ketone groups, an ester group, and hydroxyl groups. These features suggest that the property value is likely to be on the higher side, similar to the examples with complex cyclic structures and multiple functional groups.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with negative property values.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) attached to the aromatic ring, which can also contribute to a negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
- An alkene group (CC(C)=C) attached to the nitrogen, which is less common in the examples but could influence the property value.

Based on the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (0.02727993) and Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O (1.18045518), tend to have property values around zero or slightly positive.
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like trifluoromethyl can further decrease the property value, as seen in CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 (-0.71111901).

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be negative, influenced by the electron-withdrawing groups and the nitro groups. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.5 to -0.7.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.65.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.9563030303469079
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl acetate, an ester. Esters in the examples tend to have a range of property values, but we can look for similar structures to guide our prediction. For instance, the molecule CC(C)CCOC=O (an ester with a similar functional group) has a property value of -0.14625013. 

Given the structural similarity and the presence of the ester functional group, we can predict that the property value for CC(C)OC=O will be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O is approximately -0.15.

True Property: -0.2550902513456276
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples.

1. **Aromaticity and Substitution**: The molecule has an aromatic ring with a hydroxyl group (phenol) and two methyl groups. Aromatic compounds with hydroxyl groups tend to have negative property values in the examples, such as c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC (-0.47876051) and c1ccccc1O (0.58775623).

2. **Substituent Effects**: The presence of methyl groups can influence the property value. In the examples, methyl-substituted aromatics like Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)c2cc(c(Cl)cc2O)S(N)(=O)=O (4.4935759) and CCc1ccccc1C (-0.53700496) show varying effects depending on other functional groups.

3. **Hydroxyl Group Influence**: The hydroxyl group in phenols typically contributes to a more negative property value due to its polar nature, as seen in Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 (0.38849826).

Considering these factors, the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is expected to have a property value that is slightly negative due to the presence of the hydroxyl group and the influence of the methyl groups. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is approximately:

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 4.293153664846036
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is present in several examples with relatively high property values, such as:

- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl: 3.57237303
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl: 4.24699711
- COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl: 2.67931501

These examples suggest that the presence of the phosphorothioate group contributes significantly to the property value. Additionally, the molecule contains a methoxy group (OC) and a thiomethyl group (SC), which are less common in the examples but could influence the property value.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of the phosphorothioate group, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be in the range of the examples with similar groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 3.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples given.

Let's consider the examples with similar structures:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1.41333947.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 2.27453709.

The molecule in question, Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is a chlorinated biphenyl with multiple chlorine atoms, similar to the examples above. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in the examples.

Given the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, I would predict the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl to be approximately 1.8.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.9182663780210901
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to the end. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Simple aliphatic chains like CCC (propane) have a positive property value (1.65786868).
- The presence of a nitro group tends to decrease the property value, as seen in molecules with nitro groups having negative or less positive values compared to similar structures without nitro groups.

Considering these observations, the presence of the nitro group in CCCN(=O)=O is likely to reduce the property value compared to CCC. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O would be lower than that of CCC, but still potentially positive due to the aliphatic chain.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 0.5.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.28333222990935986
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, similar to the example Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, which has a property value of -0.52764519.

The presence of a fluorine atom, which is more electronegative than chlorine, might slightly affect the property value. However, given the similarity in structure to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can expect the property value to be in a similar range, possibly slightly more negative due to the increased electronegativity of fluorine.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be approximately -0.55.

True Property: -0.7185996370309394
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with complex ring structures and multiple functional groups tend to have higher property values. For instance, CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO has a very high property value of 13.54358019.

2. Molecules with simpler structures and fewer functional groups tend to have lower property values. For example, CC1CCCO1 has a property value of 0.15228427.

3. The presence of an alcohol group (O) in a cyclic structure, as seen in CC1CCCO1, contributes to a positive property value.

Given that CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group, it is likely to have a positive property value, but not as high as the more complex polycyclic structures with multiple functional groups.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 would be around 0.5. This accounts for the bicyclic structure and the presence of the alcohol group, which contributes positively to the property value.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 4.619891235509668
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), an amide linkage, and a phenyl ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 15.87138525. The main difference is the presence of a thioether linkage (SC) and a chloro group (CCl) in the example, which are absent in the molecule we are predicting.

The absence of the thioether and chloro group might reduce the property value compared to the example. However, the presence of the phosphorothioate and amide groups, along with the phenyl ring, suggests that the property value will still be relatively high.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be slightly lower than 15.87138525, but still in the higher range. A predicted value could be around 12.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, specifically a methylated benzotriazole.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings and heterocycles tend to have a range of property values, often influenced by the presence of electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups. For instance, the molecule Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O has a property value of 0.38295167, and it contains a similar aromatic and heterocyclic structure with a carbonyl group.

Considering the structural similarities and the influence of the methyl group, which is a weak electron-donating group, the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is likely to be in a similar range to the example mentioned above. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 0.35.

Looking at the examples, we can find similar structures:

1. CCCCCCC(=O)OC, which is a linear ester with a similar structure, has a property value of -0.65417618.
2. CCCCCC(=O)OC, another linear ester with a slightly shorter chain, has a property value of -0.65417618.

Given the similarity in structure and the trend observed in the examples, the property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is likely to be close to these values. Therefore, I would predict the property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC to be approximately -0.65417618.

SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.2717624404765136
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is methyl benzoate, which is an ester derived from benzoic acid and methanol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Esters like CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 have a property value of -0.67080612.
2. Aromatic compounds with ester groups, such as CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, have a property value of -0.62011013.

Given that COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is similar to the second example, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, but with a methyl group instead of an ethyl group, we can expect the property value to be close to -0.62011013. The presence of the methyl group instead of an ethyl group might slightly affect the property value, but not significantly.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be approximately -0.620.

True Property: 1.3000124417550323
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the overall molecular structure.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear conjugated diene, which is a relatively simple structure compared to many of the examples provided. In the examples, simple alkenes and small hydrocarbons tend to have property values around zero, with slight variations depending on the specific structure and functional groups.

For instance, the molecule C=Cc1ccccc1 (styrene) has a property value of 0.05290516, which is close to zero. Similarly, the molecule C1CCCC1 (cyclopentane) has a property value of 0.16275916. These examples suggest that small hydrocarbons and simple alkenes tend to have property values near zero.

Given the simplicity and the conjugated nature of C=CCC=C, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be close to zero. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br, also known as tribromomethane or bromoform, is a simple halogenated compound with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly bromine, tend to have negative property values. For instance, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of -0.76588043, and Ic1cccc2ccccc12 has a property value of -0.73475017.

Given the simplicity of BrC(Br)Br compared to the more complex aromatic structures in the examples, we can expect its property value to be negative and possibly more negative than those of the more complex halogenated aromatics. However, it is unlikely to be as negative as the most complex structures with multiple functional groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around -0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule contains several functional groups and structural features that can influence its property value:

1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P=S)**: This group is present in the molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 12.25540834. The presence of this group suggests a potentially higher property value.

2. **Amide Group (N-C=O)**: The molecule contains an amide linkage, similar to several other molecules in the examples, such as CCC1(CC)C(=O)NC(=O)N(C)C1=O with a property value of -0.72673506. However, the presence of additional functional groups and aromatic rings can significantly alter the property.

3. **Aromatic Ring**: The presence of a phenyl group (c1ccccc1) is common in many examples, such as c1ccccc1C(O)c2ccccc2 with a property value of -0.72023745. The aromatic ring can contribute to a lower property value, but its effect can be modulated by other groups.

4. **Chlorine Substitution (CCl)**: The presence of a chlorine atom can influence the property value, as seen in molecules like Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of 2.27453709. Chlorine generally increases the property value.

5. **Overall Structure**: The combination of these groups, along with the specific structure of the molecule, suggests a balance between the influences of the phosphorothioate group, the amide linkage, and the aromatic ring.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is likely to be positive and relatively high, but not as high as the molecule with a similar phosphorothioate group due to the additional influence of the aromatic ring and amide group.

A reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately **5.0**.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Functional Groups and Substituents**: 
   - The molecule contains an amide group (C(=O)N), a chloro-substituted aromatic ring, a nitro group (n2nc(oc2=O)), and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C).
   - The presence of a chloro-substituted aromatic ring is similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of -0.27167709.
   - The nitro group is also present in O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of -0.2882902.

2. **Comparison with Similar Structures**:
   - The molecule CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C has a property value of 0.22680365, which suggests that the presence of the N-methyl amide group contributes positively to the property value.
   - The presence of a tert-butyl group, as seen in CCC(C)C, which has a property value of 0.42066587, might also contribute positively.

3. **Overall Consideration**:
   - The combination of electron-withdrawing groups (chloro and nitro) and electron-donating groups (tert-butyl) suggests a balance that might lead to a property value close to neutral or slightly positive.
   - The presence of multiple functional groups and the complexity of the molecule might lead to a property value that is not extremely high or low.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be around 0.1.

The molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has structural similarities to the following examples:

- Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, which has a property value of -0.75477788

The presence of multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings suggests that the property value will likely be negative, as seen in the examples with chlorinated aromatic compounds. The additional ether linkage (O-aryl-O) might slightly alter the property, but the overall trend with chlorinated aromatics is negative.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be around -0.5. This value accounts for the negative influence of the chlorine atoms and the aromatic structure, while also considering the ether linkage's potential impact.

For instance, CCC(O)CC has a property value of 0.17447455, and CC(C)O has a property value of 1.66010451. These examples suggest that small aliphatic compounds with oxygen tend to have positive property values.

This structure is somewhat similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of 2.08375699. Both molecules contain a tertiary amide and two phenyl rings, although the example has an additional heterocyclic component.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of the amide linkage and the phenyl rings, we can infer that the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be in a similar range to the example with the tertiary amide and phenyl rings.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be approximately 2.0.

Looking at the examples, we can find similar structures:

1. Cc1ccccc1N (toluene with an amine group) has a property value of 0.04460246.
2. CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (ethylbenzene) has a property value of -0.53386492.
3. CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 (cumene) has a property value of -0.69169936.

Isobutylbenzene is structurally similar to ethylbenzene and cumene, as they all have alkyl groups attached to a benzene ring. The property values for ethylbenzene and cumene are both negative and relatively close to each other.

Considering the structural similarity and the trend in the examples, the property value for isobutylbenzene (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1) is likely to be negative and in the range of the values for ethylbenzene and cumene.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have negative property values. For instance, NC(=O)c1ccccc1O has a property value of -0.12081424, and O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.29279833. On the other hand, simpler aromatic compounds like COc1ccccc1 have a positive property value of 0.13863999.

Benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, but not as strongly as nitro groups. Therefore, we can expect the property value to be slightly negative, but not as negative as those with nitro groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) would be around -0.1. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is:

- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, similar to the first example (Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2, -0.1595376).
- An aromatic ring with a heteroatom (oxygen), similar to the example Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, -0.55209528.
- A cyclic imide structure (O=C2CN(C(=O)N2)), which is somewhat similar to the cyclic structures in examples like CC12CC2(C)C(=O)N(C1=O)c3cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c3, 0.59737524.

The presence of the nitro group and the aromatic ring with a heteroatom suggests a negative contribution to the property value, as seen in the examples with similar features. The cyclic imide structure might contribute a slightly positive or neutral effect, but the overall influence of the nitro group and the aromatic heteroatom is likely to dominate.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is likely to be negative, similar to the examples with nitro groups and aromatic heteroatoms.

A reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.3 to -0.5. Given the examples, a specific prediction could be:

-0.425

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.7380919786230009
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group (N-N linkage).

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have property values that are slightly positive or negative, depending on the presence of additional functional groups.
- The molecule N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which is similar but with a different nitrogen linkage, has a property value of -0.75376759.

Given the structural similarity to N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, but with a different nitrogen linkage (N-N instead of N=N), we can expect the property value to be in a similar range, but potentially slightly less negative due to the different electronic effects of the N-N bond compared to the N=N bond.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be around -0.7.

SMILES: O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2
True Property: -0.7652998119247788
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a bicyclic compound with two amide groups, similar to some of the examples given.

The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. In the examples, we have a similar cyclic compound: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, which has a property value of -0.18968932. This compound also contains amide groups and a cyclic structure, although it has additional alkyl groups attached.

Considering the structural similarities, particularly the presence of the diketopiperazine core, we can predict that the property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 will be in a similar range. Given the lack of additional large substituents or highly electronegative atoms that might significantly alter the property, a reasonable prediction would be slightly negative, similar to the example provided.

Therefore, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately -0.2.

True Property: -0.2986224684770769
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, tend to have higher property values (2.06276463).
2. Simpler chlorinated aromatic compounds, like Clc1ccccc1Cl, have lower property values (-0.259444).

The given molecule, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is more complex than Clc1ccccc1Cl due to the additional chlorine and the biphenyl structure, but less complex than the highly chlorinated example with a property value of 2.06276463.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would likely be between the values of the simpler chlorinated aromatic compound and the more complex, highly chlorinated compound. A reasonable estimate would be around 0.5 to 1.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately 0.8.

True Property: -0.7353151858619423
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Simple aromatic compounds with alkyl groups, such as Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) and CCCc1ccccn1 (ethylpyridine), have property values close to zero, specifically 0.04460246 and -0.15320896, respectively.

2. The presence of additional alkyl groups tends to slightly decrease the property value, as seen in the example of CCC(CC)C=O (-0.1260603).

3. The presence of a benzene ring with alkyl substituents, as in Cc1ccccc1N, results in a property value close to zero.

Considering these observations, the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, which is diethylbenzene, is expected to have a property value close to zero, similar to other simple aromatic compounds with alkyl groups.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is approximately 0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is a sulfonamide derivative, which contains a benzene ring (phenyl group) attached to a sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O). In the examples, we have a few molecules with similar aromatic and nitro/sulfonamide groups:

1. Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.03478007.
2. Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.55420027.
3. Oc1cccc2cccnc12 has a property value of -0.54568763.

The presence of the sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is somewhat similar to the nitro group (N(=O)=O) in terms of electron-withdrawing effects, which can influence the property value. The aromatic ring is a common feature in these examples.

Given the structural similarity to Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of -0.03478007, and considering the electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonamide group, the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is likely to be in a similar range, possibly slightly more negative due to the additional oxygen in the sulfonamide group compared to the nitro group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be approximately -0.05.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically triphenylene. It consists of four fused benzene rings, forming a planar, aromatic structure. In the examples, similar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12, have a positive property value (0.92161503), and c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 has a property value of 1.42788518.

Given the structural similarity to these examples, particularly the fully aromatic and planar nature of the molecule, we can predict that the property value for c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 will also be positive and likely in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 is approximately 1.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles a flavonoid structure, which is known for having significant aromatic character and potential for hydrogen bonding due to the hydroxyl groups.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups, such as Oc1cccc(O)c1, have property values around 0.42.
- More complex aromatic systems with additional functional groups, like Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4, have higher property values, around 2.41.

Given the structure of the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, it is more complex than a simple phenol but less complex than the larger polycyclic aromatic systems with additional functional groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 1.5. This value accounts for the aromatic character, the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, and the ketone group, which contribute to the overall property value.

SMILES: COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC 
True Property: 0.1290522893485605
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)O), an amide group (NC(C)=O), and a thioether linkage (SC). The presence of the phosphorothioate group is similar to the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a property value of 2.67931501, and COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a property value of 2.88067507. These examples suggest that the phosphorothioate group contributes positively to the property value.

The amide group (NC(C)=O) is a common functional group that can have varying effects on the property value depending on the surrounding structure. In the example CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1, the amide group is associated with a property value of -0.63145791, indicating a potential negative contribution.

The thioether linkage (SC) is less common in the examples, but it is generally considered to have a neutral or slightly positive effect on the property value.

Considering these structural features and their potential contributions, the predicted property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is likely to be positive, but not as high as the examples with multiple halogen substitutions or larger aromatic systems. A reasonable estimate for the property value would be around 1.5.

Iteration: 57
SMILES: Cl\C=C/Cl
True Property: 1.2848896607528124
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is a simple alkene with two chlorine atoms attached to the carbon-carbon double bond. In the examples, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly chlorine, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1.41333947, and the molecule COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of 2.88067507.

Given the simplicity of Cl\C=C/Cl compared to these examples, we can expect a lower positive value. The presence of two chlorine atoms suggests a positive contribution, but the lack of additional complex functional groups or aromatic systems likely results in a smaller magnitude.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around 0.5.

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 0.973662096176141
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and their properties. Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle with a nitrogen atom in the ring, similar to benzene but with one carbon replaced by nitrogen.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as CNc1ccccc1 (aniline) and c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 (quinoline), have property values close to zero or slightly negative. Aniline has a property value of 0.00126515, and quinoline has a property value of -0.74436244. Pyridine is less electron-rich than aniline due to the presence of the nitrogen atom, which is more electronegative than carbon, and it is also less complex than quinoline.

Considering these factors, pyridine is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative but closer to zero than quinoline. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of pyridine (c1ccncc1) would be around -0.2.

To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule contains several functional groups and structural features:
- An ester linkage (OC(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)
- An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23)
- A pyridine-like structure (ccnc)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with ester linkages, such as CCCCOC(=O)CC, tend to have negative property values.
- Aromatic rings, especially chlorinated ones, often contribute to negative property values, as seen in Clc1ccc(I)cc1 and Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl.
- Amide linkages, as in CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2, also tend to have negative property values.

Considering these observations, the molecule in question is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of these functional groups and structural features. Based on the trends from the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 would be approximately -0.6.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 0.13835058118082824
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the trends in the provided examples. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol with five carbon atoms and one hydroxyl group. In the examples, we see that linear alkanes and alcohols tend to have negative property values. For instance, OC1CCCCCCC1 has a property value of -0.75546235, and C1CCC2CCCCC2C1 has a property value of -0.61919694. 

Given that CCCCCO is a simple linear alcohol, we can expect its property value to be similar to other linear alcohols or alkanes. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be around -0.7. 

Thus, the predicted property value for CCCCCO is approximately -0.7.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is often associated with polar and electron-withdrawing characteristics.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is also polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which can contribute to stability and hydrophobic interactions.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can add some polarity.

From the examples, molecules with polar groups and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values, especially when they contain multiple electron-withdrawing groups. For instance, molecules like CCC(Br)(CC)C(=O)NC(N)=O and Nc1ccc(cc1)c2ccc(N)cc2 have negative values due to the presence of polar and electron-withdrawing groups.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is likely to be negative. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.6.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:

1. **Aromatic Ring**: The presence of a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) is a common feature in many of the examples, often associated with negative property values.

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The presence of a nitro group is also seen in some examples, such as CCCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, which has a positive property value of 1.33719243.

3. **Ester Groups (C(=O)OC)**: The molecule has two ester groups, which are polar and can influence the property value. Esters are present in some examples with both positive and negative values.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring with Nitrogen**: The presence of a heterocyclic ring containing nitrogen (C1=C(C)NC) is similar to some structures with negative values, such as c2ccc1[nH]ccc1c2 (-0.28006525).

5. **Overall Complexity and Substitution**: The molecule is relatively complex with multiple functional groups and substitutions, which can lead to a higher property value.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule has a mix of features that could lead to either a positive or negative property value. However, the presence of the nitro group and the overall complexity suggest a tendency towards a positive value, but not extremely high due to the aromatic and heterocyclic components.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.5.

True Property: -0.49975923389641025
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two amide groups and a cyclohexane-like structure due to the cyclization of the peptide bond. This structure is relatively small and lacks significant functional groups that would contribute to a high property value, such as large aromatic systems or multiple halogen substitutions.

Looking at the examples, smaller molecules with amide groups and without extensive aromatic systems or halogenation tend to have property values closer to zero, often slightly negative. For instance, the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of -0.76533541, and it contains an amide group and a chloro-substituted aromatic ring.

Given the structure of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, which is a small, cyclic, and relatively simple molecule, I would predict a property value that is slightly negative, similar to other small amide-containing molecules.

Therefore, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of molecular structures with different functional groups and sizes, and their property values range from negative to positive.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure, consisting of a chloroethane group. In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules, such as CCC (propane) and Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene), tend to have property values closer to zero, either slightly positive or negative. For instance, Clc1ccccc1 has a property value of 0.18646355, and CCC1CCCCC1 (cyclohexane) has a property value of -0.73319954.

Given the simplicity and small size of ClCC, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be close to zero, likely slightly positive due to the presence of the chlorine atom, which can influence the property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC is approximately 0.1.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a pyridine ring and a trichloromethyl group. In the examples, similar structures with chlorinated aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups tend to have negative property values. For instance:

- Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2 has a property value of -0.74101351.
- Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -0.29862247.
- Oc1c(Cl)cccc1Cl has a property value of -0.36266688.

These examples suggest that the presence of chlorine atoms and aromatic rings generally leads to negative property values. The trichloromethyl group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which could further decrease the property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is likely to be negative and similar to the examples with multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings. A reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.5.

Looking at the examples, we can see that alcohols and similar structures tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCCCCC(O)CCC has a property value of -0.58674077, and CCC(C)CCO has a property value of -0.2245963. These examples suggest that the presence of an alcohol group in a medium-length carbon chain results in a negative property value.

Given the structure of CCCCC(C)O and its similarity to the examples, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be slightly negative, similar to the other alcohols in the list. Therefore, I would predict the property value for CCCCC(C)O to be approximately -0.3.

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: -0.6977115957757967
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the given examples and their properties. The molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is 1,4-dibromobenzene, which is a simple aromatic compound with two bromine atoms attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values. For instance, ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 has a property value of 1.46126842, and ClC(=C)Cl has a property value of 1.53490104.
2. The presence of multiple halogen atoms, especially heavier halogens like bromine, can increase the property value compared to compounds with lighter halogens like chlorine.

Considering these observations, 1,4-dibromobenzene is expected to have a positive property value, likely higher than those of similar chlorinated compounds due to the presence of bromine, which is heavier than chlorine.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around 1.5 to 2.0. Given the examples and trends, a specific predicted property value could be approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a chlorinated biphenyl, similar to the example Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 5.69981584. The given molecule has fewer chlorine atoms than the example, which suggests it might have a lower property value due to reduced molecular weight and possibly different electronic effects.

Considering the pattern in the examples, the property values seem to increase with the number of chlorine atoms and the complexity of the structure. Given that the provided molecule is less chlorinated and potentially less complex than the example with a value of 5.69981584, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be somewhat lower.

Therefore, a predicted property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl could be approximately 4.5.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a triaryl phosphate ester, which includes three aromatic rings and a phosphate group. The presence of aromatic rings and a phosphate group suggests that the property value might be influenced by factors such as aromaticity, electronic effects, and steric hindrance.

Looking at the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and functional groups like carbonyls, nitro groups, or halogens tend to have property values ranging from slightly negative to moderately positive. For instance, molecules with multiple aromatic rings and functional groups like COc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(OC)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl have a property value of 2.23217171, while simpler aromatic compounds like Clc1ccccc1Cl have a property value of -0.259444.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple aromatic rings and a phosphate group, the property value for the given molecule is likely to be positive but not extremely high. It is reasonable to predict a property value in the range of 1 to 3.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1 is approximately 2.0.

- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to be electron-withdrawing and can increase the molecule's lipophilicity.
- An aromatic ring, which is common in many of the examples.
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle, specifically a piperidine ring with two chlorine atoms and a ketone group.

From the examples, molecules with halogens, especially multiple chlorines, tend to have higher property values. For instance:
- ClC1=C(Cl)C(Cl)(C(=C1Cl)Cl)C2(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C(=C2Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of 4.38537761.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 2.27453709.

The presence of the CF3 group and the ketone in the piperidine ring could further influence the property value, potentially increasing it due to the electron-withdrawing nature of CF3 and the polar nature of the ketone.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O is likely to be relatively high, similar to other halogenated compounds with multiple chlorines. A reasonable prediction would be around 3.0 to 4.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately 3.5.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.3103848836120938
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (OCH3) attached to a benzene ring, with a nitro group (NO2) also attached to the ring.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have positive property values. For instance, O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.2882902, and ClC(Cl)(Cl)N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.3975233.
- The presence of a methoxy group, which is an electron-donating group, can influence the property value. For example, c1ccccc1O has a property value of 0.58775623.

Considering these factors, the presence of both an electron-donating methoxy group and an electron-withdrawing nitro group on the benzene ring suggests a balance between these effects. The property value is likely to be slightly positive, reflecting the influence of the nitro group.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is approximately 0.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, which is similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 0.05951572. Both molecules are heavily chlorinated, which generally increases the electron-withdrawing nature and can affect the overall property value.

Given the structural similarity and the high degree of chlorination, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl will be close to that of the example provided. However, the additional complexity and potential steric effects of the structure might slightly alter the value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl would be approximately 0.05.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: 0.8085180766865039
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with simple alkyl chains, such as CCC#C (1.769481) and CCCCC#C (0.32818118), tend to have positive property values.
- Molecules with ester or carbonyl groups, such as CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 (-0.69149933) and CC(=O)Nc1nnc(s1)S(N)(=O)=O (-0.38441979), tend to have negative property values.

Given that CCCOC=O is a small ester, it is likely to have a property value similar to other small esters or carbonyl-containing compounds. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the ester group.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCOC=O could be approximately -0.4.

True Property: 0.09642104810033388
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a long-chain ester, specifically a decanoate ester, which is similar to other aliphatic compounds in the examples.

Looking at the examples, aliphatic compounds such as CC (2.41363215), CCOC (0.89629343), and CCCCCC(CC)C=O (-0.70177185) have varying property values, but they tend to be positive or slightly negative. The presence of an ester group (C(=O)O) in CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC suggests it might have a property value similar to other esters or aliphatic compounds with functional groups.

Considering the structure and the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be slightly positive, reflecting the influence of the ester group and the long aliphatic chain. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

This molecule contains:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O)
- Two chlorine atoms attached to the aromatic rings

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have negative property values.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, have property values close to zero.
- The presence of chlorine atoms in aromatic rings, as seen in several examples, often results in negative property values.

Considering these observations, the molecule in question is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of the nitro group and chlorine atoms, which tend to lower the property value. The amide linkage might slightly offset this effect, but not significantly.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be around -0.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O) attached to aromatic rings. In the examples, the molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of 12.25540834, which is notably high. This suggests that the presence of phosphorothioate groups significantly increases the property value.

The molecule also contains aromatic rings, similar to other examples with aromatic structures, which tend to have varying property values depending on the substituents. However, the presence of two phosphorothioate groups is a dominant feature likely to influence the property value significantly.

Given the structural similarity to the example with a high property value and the presence of two phosphorothioate groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 will also be high.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately 12.25540834, similar to the example with a single phosphorothioate group, but potentially slightly higher due to the presence of two such groups. However, without exact calculations or additional data, this is an estimation based on structural analogy.

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.027279932582217975
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can see that molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, have negative property values. The presence of the nitro group, which is electron-withdrawing, tends to lower the property value. Additionally, the presence of a hydroxyl group (as in phenols) can also influence the property value, often making it more negative due to its electron-donating nature through resonance.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be around -0.2 to -0.3. Given the specific example of Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O with a property value of -0.22373086, and considering the additional influence of the hydroxyl group, a predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be approximately:

-0.250

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. This molecule is a complex carbohydrate, likely a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide, characterized by multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages.

From the examples, it appears that the property values are influenced by the presence of functional groups, molecular size, and complexity. Carbohydrates, with their numerous hydroxyl groups, tend to have lower property values due to their polar nature and potential for hydrogen bonding, which can affect solubility and other properties.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, the property value is likely to be negative or close to zero, similar to other polar and complex molecules in the examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne, with a terminal triple bond. 

In the examples, we see that small hydrocarbons and simple functional groups tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCC(C)C(=O)C has a property value of -0.02230713, and CCC(C)OC(=O)C has a value of -0.4650846. These examples suggest that small hydrocarbons with simple functional groups tend to have negative property values.

Given that CCC#C is a small hydrocarbon with a triple bond, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Considering the examples and the nature of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around -0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a high property value of 12.25540834.
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 1.41333947.

The presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a potentially high property value, as seen in the example with a similar group. The aromatic ring with multiple chlorine substituents also contributes to the property value, but not as significantly as the phosphorothioate group.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be high, but not as high as the example with the additional functional groups and complexity. A reasonable prediction would be around 8.0, given the influence of the phosphorothioate group and the chlorinated aromatic ring.

Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately 8.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a pyridine derivative with a carbonyl group attached to a hydrazine moiety.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro groups) tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings or complex structures tend to have higher property values, often positive.
- Simple aliphatic chains or small cyclic structures often have negative property values.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 has a pyridine ring, which is an aromatic heterocycle, and a carbonyl group attached to a hydrazine, which is an electron-withdrawing group. This structure is somewhat similar to other aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, which generally have negative property values.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is likely to be negative. Based on the trends observed, a reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.3.

True Property: 17.463827830287162
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule contains several functional groups and structural motifs that can influence its property value:

1. **Phosphorothioate Group (P(=S)(O)S)**: This group is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, which has a property value of 1.69046927. The presence of this group suggests a positive contribution to the property value.

2. **Amide Group (C(=O)N)**: The amide group is present in several examples, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C with a property value of 0.22680365, indicating a moderate influence.

3. **Cyclohexyl Group (N1CCCCC1)**: This group is similar to the cyclohexyl group in C/C1CCC(\C)CC1, which has a property value of -0.69838627, suggesting a negative contribution.

4. **Alkyl Chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)**: These are common in many examples and generally contribute to a moderate to slightly negative property value.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is likely to have a property value that is slightly positive due to the presence of the phosphorothioate group, but moderated by the cyclohexyl and amide groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be approximately **1.3**.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.7296059313642568
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (octane), we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of functional groups, aromatic rings, and the overall size of the molecule.

In the examples, we see that:
- Simple alkanes like CCCCCC (hexane) have a property value of -0.60231999.
- The presence of functional groups like alcohols or halogens tends to increase or decrease the property value depending on their nature and position.
- Larger and more complex molecules with multiple rings or functional groups tend to have higher property values.

Given that CCCCCCCC is a simple linear alkane with no functional groups, we can expect its property value to be similar to that of other simple alkanes. Since hexane (CCCCCC) has a property value of -0.60231999, and considering that octane is slightly larger but still a simple alkane, the property value for octane is likely to be slightly more negative due to increased hydrophobicity and lack of polar functional groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (octane) would be approximately -0.65.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as functional groups, molecular size, and overall molecular geometry. The examples provided suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the complexity of the molecular structure.

The molecule in question, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, contains several notable features:
- A cyclohexane framework with multiple fused rings, which is similar to some of the other complex polycyclic structures in the examples.
- A hydroxyl group (O) and a carbonyl group (C=O), which can influence the property value.
- An alkyne group (C#C), which is a feature not commonly seen in the examples but can contribute to the overall property.

Given the complexity and the presence of both polar and non-polar groups, the property value is likely to be positive, similar to other complex polycyclic structures with polar functional groups.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, I would predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately 6.5.

True Property: 26.236017434602214
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like the one you've provided involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples given. The molecule in question, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, appears to be a highly complex structure with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and oxygen-containing functional groups.

From the examples provided, it seems that molecules with more complex structures and higher molecular weights tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21 has a very high property value of 21.38785823, likely due to its large size and complexity.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups in the molecule you provided, it is reasonable to predict a relatively high property value. However, it is not as large as the most complex example provided, so the value should be somewhat lower than 21.38785823.

Based on these considerations, I would predict the property value for the molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 to be approximately 15.0.

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 0.04275566283180693
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to some of the examples provided.

Let's consider the examples with similar structures:
1. Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (nitrophenol) has a property value of 0.02727993.
2. Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (another nitrophenol) has a property value of 0.021468.
3. Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) has a property value of 0.63213016.
4. Clc1ccccc1I (iodochlorobenzene) has a property value of -0.65792107.

The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) and a chlorine atom (Cl) on a benzene ring suggests that the property value might be influenced by both the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorine and the electron-donating effect of the hydroxyl group. The examples with halogens and hydroxyl groups on benzene rings show a range of property values, but the presence of a single chlorine atom tends to result in a negative property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is likely to be slightly negative, similar to the example with Clc1ccccc1I. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl is approximately -0.65.

To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C), which is a small, polarizable group.
- An ester linkage (OC(=O)), which is polar and can contribute to a moderate property value.
- An amide linkage (NC(=O)), which is also polar and can contribute to a moderate property value.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1), which is similar to some of the examples with moderate to high property values.

Comparing with similar structures:
- The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 2.27453709.
- The molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1.41333947.
- The molecule ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl has a property value of 0.05951572.

Given the presence of polar groups and the chlorinated aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be positive but not as high as the fully chlorinated aromatic systems. Considering the balance of polar and non-polar components, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around 0.5.

True Property: 2.1049457756486563
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has:
- Two chlorophenyl groups, which are present in several examples with varying contributions to the property value.
- A hydroxyl group (OH) attached to a carbon, which can influence the property value.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2), which is a heterocyclic aromatic ring.

From the examples:
- Molecules with chlorophenyl groups, such as Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.52764519) and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (-0.25478014), tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of a hydroxyl group, as in Oc1ccc(O)cc1 (0.42242187), can contribute positively.
- Heterocyclic aromatic rings, like in Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2 (-0.28022677), can have a negative or slightly positive influence.

Considering these factors, the molecule has a mix of features that contribute both positively and negatively. The presence of multiple chlorophenyl groups and a pyrimidine ring suggests a tendency towards a negative property value, but the hydroxyl group may offset this to some extent.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl would be slightly negative, around -0.3.

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 0.19763282856547001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCCCOC=O is an ester, specifically a linear alkyl ester, similar to the example molecule CCCCCCC=O, which has a property value of -0.17012643. 

The presence of the ester functional group (OC=O) in CCCCCOC=O is similar to the ester group in CCCCCCC=O, and both molecules have a similar linear alkyl chain. The main difference is the length of the carbon chain, with CCCCCOC=O having one less carbon than CCCCCCC=O. 

Considering the trend in the examples, where longer carbon chains tend to have slightly more negative property values, we can predict that CCCCCOC=O will have a property value slightly less negative than -0.17012643. 

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be approximately -0.15.

To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we can look at the example provided for a similar molecule, ClCCCl, which has a property value of 0.62709419. The molecule ClCCl is a simpler structure, being dichloromethane, compared to ClCCCl, which is 1,2-dichloroethane. Given the trend that smaller, less complex molecules tend to have lower property values, we can predict that ClCCl will have a property value slightly lower than that of ClCCCl.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be approximately 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a methylphenol, specifically p-cresol, which is a phenol derivative with a methyl group attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with phenol groups (e.g., Oc1cccc(O)c1) tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of additional electron-donating groups like methyl groups on the benzene ring can influence the property value.

Given these observations, the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is similar to the example CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, which has a property value of -0.72765843. However, the presence of the hydroxyl group (O) in Cc1cccc(C)c1O, which is a strong electron-donating group, might increase the property value compared to the example with only alkyl groups.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is likely to be slightly less negative than -0.72765843, but still negative due to the overall structure. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.6.

This molecule is a dichlorinated biphenyl, similar to the example Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 1.41333947. The given molecule has four chlorine atoms, similar to the example, but it is less chlorinated than the hexachlorinated biphenyl example, which has a higher property value.

Considering the pattern that more chlorination tends to increase the property value, and given that the structure is similar to the example with a property value of 1.41333947, we can predict that the property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl will be slightly lower than 1.41333947 due to having fewer chlorine atoms.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl would be approximately 1.2.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a small hydrocarbon with a branched structure and a double bond.

From the examples, we can observe that small hydrocarbons, especially those with double bonds or branching, tend to have negative property values. For instance:

- CCCCC(CC)C=O has a property value of -0.70177185.
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 has a property value of -0.69169936.
- CCCCCCCC=C has a property value of -0.74616049.
- CCCCCCCC has a property value of -0.72960593.

These examples suggest that small hydrocarbons with similar features to isoprene have property values in the range of approximately -0.7 to -0.75.

Therefore, based on the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for CC=C(C)C is approximately -0.72.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1.3464812526401042
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the degree of chlorination.

In the examples, highly chlorinated compounds tend to have higher property values. For instance, the compound ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of 4.22635588, and ClC4=C(Cl)C5(Cl)C3C1CC(C2OC12)C3C4(Cl)C5(Cl)Cl has a property value of 4.62989295. However, these are large, complex molecules with multiple chlorine atoms.

For smaller molecules, such as ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl, the property value is 0.14412419. Given that ClCCl is a small molecule with two chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a property value closer to this range.

Therefore, based on the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for ClCCl is approximately 0.14412419.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.6285113945284341
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

In the examples, we have:

1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, with a property value of -0.6260752. This is 2,4,6-trichlorophenol, which is very similar to the target molecule.

Given the structural similarity, we can predict that the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl will be very close to -0.6260752. Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is approximately -0.626.

True Property: 26.236017434602214
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples. The examples provided show a range of property values associated with different structural features, such as aromatic rings, functional groups, and overall molecular complexity.

The molecule in question contains multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and a complex polycyclic structure, which suggests a high degree of molecular complexity. This complexity is often associated with higher property values in the examples provided. Additionally, the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (methoxy, hydroxyl, and carbonyl groups) can influence the property value.

Considering these factors and comparing them to the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be in the higher range. Based on the examples, a predicted property value could be approximately 5.0.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.385562658875162
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A thioether group (CS-)
- A pyrazole ring (1,2,4-triazole-like structure)
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- A tertiary butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of bulky groups like tertiary butyl can influence the property value, often making it less negative or even positive.
- Molecules with sulfur-containing groups (like thioethers) can have a range of property values, but they often contribute to a less negative or slightly positive value.

Considering these factors, the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is likely to have a property value that is slightly positive or close to zero, due to the combination of the thioether, carbonyl, and bulky tertiary butyl group.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be approximately 0.3.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.6201101303617748
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ethyl group (CCO) attached to a benzoate group (c1ccccc1C(=O)O).

Looking at the examples, we can find some similar structures:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 has a property value of 6.79517564. This molecule is more complex due to the presence of additional functional groups like sulfonamide and a heterocyclic ring, which likely contribute to its higher property value.

2. CCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of -0.53129294. This is a simple ester with a longer alkyl chain, but without the aromatic ring.

3. CCCCC(=O)OCC has a property value of -0.57535684. This is another simple ester with a longer alkyl chain.

4. CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of -0.7540911. This is a diketone with an aromatic ring, which is structurally different but provides insight into the influence of aromatic rings.

Considering the structure of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, it is simpler than the first example but more complex than the simple esters due to the presence of the aromatic ring. The aromatic ring may contribute to a slightly higher property value compared to the simple esters.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around -0.6. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

-0.60000000

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.7334310058461448
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their properties. The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom at the end. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Linear alkyl chains tend to have negative property values, such as CCCCCCCCO (-0.60231999) and CCCCCCC=C (-0.60243886).
- The presence of a halogen, such as bromine, can influence the property value. For instance, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a property value of -0.76588043.

Considering these observations, the molecule CCCCCCCBr is similar to CCCCCCCCO in terms of the linear alkyl chain, but with a bromine atom instead of an oxygen atom. The presence of bromine, a heavier halogen, might slightly decrease the property value compared to the oxygen-containing compound.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be slightly more negative than -0.60231999. A predicted property value could be approximately -0.65.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 3.5817370787527794
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide) based on the examples provided is challenging due to the lack of similar simple diatomic molecules in the dataset. However, considering the nature of CO as a small, non-polar molecule with a triple bond, it might be expected to have a property value that is relatively low compared to larger, more complex molecules.

Given the examples, smaller and simpler molecules like CCC (propane) have a property value of 1.65786868, while more complex structures tend to have higher values. However, CO is even simpler than propane and lacks the complexity and functional groups that might contribute to higher property values.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO, considering its simplicity and the trend in the examples, would be a value close to zero, possibly slightly negative or positive. A speculative estimate could be around 0.0, acknowledging the uncertainty due to the lack of directly comparable examples.
