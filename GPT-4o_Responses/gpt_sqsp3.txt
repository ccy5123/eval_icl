SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 1.3153262182900172
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, particularly focusing on the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and branching of the molecule. 

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a linear chain of 10 carbon atoms with an ester functional group at the end. Comparing this to the example CCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which has a property value of 1.43144851, we can see that the only difference is the length of the carbon chain. The example has 11 carbons, while the molecule in question has 10.

Given that the property value seems to increase with the length of the carbon chain, and considering the pattern in the examples, I would predict that the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is slightly lower than 1.43144851. A reasonable estimate would be around 1.0. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is approximately 1.0.

CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple rings and carbonyl groups. Let's break it down:

1. **Polycyclic Structure**: The molecule has a fused ring system, which is similar to some of the examples provided, such as "CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C" with a property value of 0.57261927. This suggests that the presence of multiple rings and carbonyl groups can lead to a positive property value.

2. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains carbonyl groups (C=O), which are common in several examples with positive property values. For instance, "CCCC(=O)CCC" has a property value of 0.90945413, and "CCCCCCCCC(=O)C" has a property value of 1.24140488.

3. **Overall Structure**: The molecule's structure is quite complex, with a combination of rings and functional groups that are likely to influence its property value. The presence of hydroxyl (OH) and carbonyl (C=O) groups, along with the polycyclic framework, suggests a property value that is not extremely high or low.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A benzene ring with two fluorine atoms (similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.60630275).
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N) connecting to another benzene ring with a chlorine atom (similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 0.0).

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like fluorine and chlorine, along with the amide linkage, suggests that the property value might be influenced by these features. The examples with similar functional groups and aromatic systems tend to have negative or zero property values.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 is likely to be around -0.60630275, similar to the example with fluorinated benzene. However, the additional amide linkage and chlorine substitution might slightly adjust this value.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Alkyl Chain (CCC(C)-):** The presence of an alkyl chain often contributes positively to the property value, as seen in several examples with high property values (e.g., CCC(C)CC, CCCCCCCBr).

2. **Pyrrole Ring (n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O):** Pyrrole rings with carbonyl groups tend to have negative property values, as seen in examples like OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O (-0.32066679) and CCN(CC)C(=O)CSc1ccc(Cl)nn1 (-0.79577236).

3. **Bromine Substitution:** The presence of a bromine atom can influence the property value, but its effect is not straightforward. In some cases, it contributes to a negative property value, as seen in CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.5470935).

Considering these factors, the molecule has a mix of features that contribute both positively and negatively to the property value. The alkyl chain suggests a positive contribution, while the pyrrole ring with carbonyl groups and bromine substitution suggests a negative contribution.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, the predicted property value for CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O is likely to be negative, similar to other pyrrole-containing compounds with carbonyl groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately **-0.60630275**, aligning with other similar structures in the examples.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the overall molecular structure. The molecule in question, c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, is biphenyl, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond.

In the examples, molecules with purely aromatic structures, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tend to have a property value of 0.0.

True Property: 2.1220596321745613
Predicted Property:

Molecules with simple alkane or cycloalkane structures, such as C1CCC2CCCCC2C1, CC(C)I, and CCCCCCC(C)C, have a property value of 2.12205963. This suggests that saturated hydrocarbons or similar structures tend to have this property value.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear alkane with a terminal thiol group. While the presence of sulfur might suggest a deviation from the typical alkane property value, the examples provided do not include a direct comparison for a thiol group. However, given the trend that simple hydrocarbons tend to have a property value of 2.12205963, and considering the lack of specific examples for thiols, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CCCCCS would be similar to that of other simple hydrocarbons.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCS is 2.12205963.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C", we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic imide, similar to "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C", which has a property value of -0.94497968. The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the new molecule.

The examples suggest that cyclic imides tend to have negative property values, and the addition of alkyl chains generally does not significantly alter the property value from the base cyclic structure. Therefore, the property value for the new molecule is likely to be similar to the example with a slight adjustment due to the additional alkyl chain.

Based on this analysis, the predicted property value for "O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C" is approximately -0.94497968.

These examples suggest that aromatic rings with halogen substituents tend to have a property value of 0.0.

Given that trifluoromethylbenzene has a similar structure with an aromatic ring and a halogen-containing substituent, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be 0.0. Therefore, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is 0.0.

- Simple hydrocarbons or those with alkyl groups tend to have positive property values.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a simple aromatic compound with a hydroxyl group and two methyl groups. This structure is somewhat similar to c1ccccc1O, which has a property value of 0.0, but the presence of methyl groups might slightly alter this value.

Considering the examples and the structure of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be slightly negative due to the electron-donating effect of the methyl groups, but not as negative as more complex or electron-withdrawing substituted phenols.

Therefore, a predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 could be around -0.60630275, similar to other substituted aromatic compounds with electron-donating groups.

- Simple alkanes and small alcohols tend to have positive property values, such as CCC (2.12205963) and C1CCCCC1 (2.12205963).

Given that CCCN(=O)=O is a small nitroalkane, it is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of the nitro group, which is electron-withdrawing and can affect the overall property.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around -0.7, similar to other nitro-containing compounds in the examples. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O is approximately:

- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C), which is similar to the structure in CC(C)C, which has a property value of 2.12205963.

The molecule is a combination of these functional groups, and the property values of similar structures range from 0.0 to 2.12205963. The presence of the dimethylamino group and the tert-butyl group suggests a positive contribution, while the aromatic and nitro groups suggest a neutral or slightly negative contribution.

Considering the balance of these contributions, the predicted property value for CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C is likely to be slightly positive, but not as high as 2.12205963. A reasonable estimate, considering the examples, would be around 0.50929431, which is a moderate positive value seen in some of the examples with similar functional groups.

This structure is somewhat similar to the example CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3, which has a property value of -0.5470935. Both molecules contain a tertiary amide linkage and two phenyl rings, although the example has an additional heterocyclic component.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of the tertiary amide and phenyl groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 will be in a similar range to the example with a value of -0.5470935. However, the absence of the heterocyclic component and the presence of a tert-butyl group might slightly alter the value.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be approximately -0.5470935.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is an acetanilide derivative with a bromine substituent on the phenyl ring. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Acetanilide Core (CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1):** This part of the molecule is similar to the structure CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -0.73360265. The acetanilide core contributes to a negative property value due to the presence of the amide group.

2. **Bromine Substituent (Br):** The presence of a bromine atom on the phenyl ring is seen in several examples with a property value of 0.0, such as Fc1cccc(Br)c1 and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1. The bromine substituent tends to neutralize the property value.

Considering these factors, the acetanilide core suggests a negative property value, while the bromine substituent tends to neutralize it. The overall effect is likely to be a slightly negative property value, but not as negative as the acetanilide core alone.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around -0.60630275, similar to Cc1ccc(N)cc1, which also has a negative property value due to the presence of an amide group and a neutralizing substituent.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with similar structures, such as CC(C)CO, CCC(C)O, and CC(C)CCO, have a property value of 2.12205963. These molecules contain an isobutyl or similar alkyl group, which seems to contribute to a higher property value.

Additionally, aromatic compounds like c1ccc2c(c1)c3ccccc3c4ccccc24 and N(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 have a property value of 0.0, indicating that the presence of an aromatic ring alone does not significantly increase the property value.

Considering the structure of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, which combines an isobutyl group with a benzene ring, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be influenced more by the isobutyl group, similar to the examples with high property values.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is 2.12205963.

For instance, molecules like NC(=O)c1ccccc1O and O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O both have a property value of 0.0. Additionally, simple aromatic compounds like c1cncnc1 also have a property value of 0.0.

Given that benzaldehyde is a relatively simple aromatic compound with an aldehyde group, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be 0.0, similar to other simple aromatic compounds in the examples.

Considering the presence of the nitro group and the lactam structure, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value. The examples with similar features tend to have property values around -0.6 to -0.9. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be approximately -0.8.

To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)O), an amide group (NC(C)=O), and a thioether linkage (SC). Let's compare these features with the examples:

1. **Phosphorothioate group**: The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a phosphorothioate group and a property value of -0.86208673. The molecule COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl has a phosphonate group and a property value of -0.76394147.

2. **Amide group**: The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has an amide group and a property value of -0.5470935. The molecule CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCCCC2 also contains amide groups and has a property value of -0.56735622.

3. **Thioether linkage**: The molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C has a thioether linkage and a property value of 1.47786296. However, this molecule is much larger and more complex.

Considering the structural features and the property values of similar molecules, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the amide group suggests a negative property value, as seen in the examples with similar functional groups. The thioether linkage in this context does not significantly alter the trend towards a negative value.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around -0.7, considering the influence of the phosphorothioate and amide groups. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

- An ester group (COC(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)
- An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23)
- A pyridine-like structure (ccnc)

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and amide linkages, such as CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2 and CC(OC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1)C#C, tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of a chlorine atom on an aromatic ring, as seen in Clc1ccc(I)cc1 and Cl\C=C/Cl, often results in a property value of 0.0, but this is not consistent across all examples.
- Molecules with ester groups, such as CCCCCC(=O)OC, have positive property values, but this is not a strong trend.

Considering these observations, the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 has structural similarities to molecules with negative property values due to the presence of an amide linkage and aromatic rings. The chlorine atom on the aromatic ring might influence the property value, but given the overall structure, it is more likely to have a negative impact.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule is approximately -0.94703488, similar to other complex aromatic and amide-containing structures in the examples.

For instance, the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a sulfonyl group and an aromatic ring, and it has a property value of -0.93370624. Similarly, CC(C)Oc1cc(c(Cl)cc1Cl)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, which contains an aromatic ring and other electronegative groups, has a property value of -0.85825523.

Given the presence of the sulfonyl group, the amide linkage, and the aromatic ring, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 will also be negative and likely in a similar range to the examples with similar functional groups.

Given this pattern, and considering that CCC#C is a relatively simple hydrocarbon with a triple bond, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. However, the presence of the triple bond might slightly reduce the value compared to saturated hydrocarbons.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around 0.5.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: -0.9337062381568072
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -0.86640305.
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, both of which have a property value of 0.0.

Considering these structural similarities, the presence of the phosphorothioate group, and the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be close to -0.86640305, due to the influence of the phosphorothioate group, but slightly adjusted due to the presence of the aromatic ring with chlorine substituents.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is approximately -0.86640305.

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 contains a pyridine ring (a six-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen atom) and a hydrazide group (C(=O)NN). In the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and additional functional groups like carbonyls and amines tend to have negative property values, especially when they contain nitrogen or oxygen atoms that can participate in hydrogen bonding or other polar interactions.

For instance, the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of 0.0, and it contains a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring. The molecule COc1nc(NC(C)C)nc(NC(C)C)n1 has a property value of -0.07427209, and it contains nitrogen atoms and carbonyl groups.

Given the presence of the pyridine ring and the hydrazide group, which are similar to the functional groups in the examples with negative property values, it is reasonable to predict a slightly negative property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is approximately -0.1.

SMILES: CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C
True Property: 1.4778629581215696
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Several alkyl chains

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with sulfur-containing groups like CCS and CCBr have a property value of 2.12205963.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, have a property value of 0.50929431.
- Molecules with complex ring structures and multiple functional groups tend to have negative property values, such as CCN2c1cc(N(C)C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23 with -0.91784586.

Given the presence of both sulfur and an amide linkage, along with a piperidine ring, the molecule is likely to have a property value influenced by these features. The presence of sulfur groups in the examples often leads to a higher property value, while the amide linkage and complex structure might reduce it.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C is likely to be around 0.5, balancing the influence of the sulfur group and the amide linkage.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and an alkyne group (C#C). It resembles some of the polycyclic structures in the examples, such as:

- CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 0.79944629.
- CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO, which has a property value of 0.07015073.

Both of these examples have polycyclic structures with oxygen-containing functional groups, similar to the molecule in question. The presence of the hydroxyl group and the alkyne group in the target molecule might influence the property value, but the overall structure suggests it might be closer to the first example due to the presence of the hydroxyl group and the polycyclic nature.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C would be around 0.799, as it shares more structural similarity with the first example than the second. Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately:

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings. Let's break down the key features:

1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains aromatic rings, similar to many of the examples with a property value of 0.0.
2. **Ether and Ester Linkages**: The presence of ether and ester groups is common in molecules with negative property values, such as -0.5470935 or -0.719045.
3. **Polycyclic Structure**: The molecule has a complex polycyclic structure, which is seen in some examples with negative property values, such as -0.94313761.

Given these observations, the molecule shares similarities with those having negative property values, particularly due to its complex structure and functional groups. However, the presence of multiple aromatic rings and ether linkages suggests a property value closer to those with moderate negative values.

Based on the analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C)
- An ester linkage (OC(=O))
- An amide linkage (NC(=O))
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substitutions, such as chlorinated aromatics, often have a property value of 0.0.
- Molecules with amide linkages tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of an ester linkage can also contribute to a negative property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of the amide and ester linkages, despite the chlorinated aromatic ring.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.6. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is:

The molecule contains:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2).
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with phenyl rings and halogen substituents often have a property value of 0.0.
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings like pyrimidine also tend to have a property value of 0.0.
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings and halogens does not necessarily lead to a non-zero property value unless there are specific functional groups or structural features that influence the property.

Given these observations, the structure of OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl resembles those with a property value of 0.0, as it primarily consists of aromatic rings with halogen substituents and a pyrimidine ring.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl is 0.0.

True Property: -0.509294311721895
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the examples provided and identify patterns or trends in the data. The molecule CC=C(C)C is a small, branched alkene, specifically 2-methyl-1-butene.

From the examples, we observe that:

1. Simple alkanes and alkenes with longer carbon chains tend to have positive property values. For instance, CCCCC(CC)C=O has a property value of 1.04445123, and CCCCCCCC has a property value of 2.12205963.
2. The presence of functional groups like carbonyls, nitro groups, or aromatic rings often results in negative or zero property values.
3. The property value seems to increase with the length of the carbon chain in alkanes and alkenes.

Given that CC=C(C)C is a small alkene with no additional functional groups that typically lower the property value, we can expect a positive property value, but likely smaller than those of longer alkanes or alkenes.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around 0.5.

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, including methoxy groups, hydroxyl groups, and cyclic ethers. It also contains a fused ring system, which is similar to some of the more complex structures in the examples.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with complex polycyclic structures and multiple oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have negative property values. For instance:

- O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 has a property value of -0.93607383.
- O=C1N(COC(=O)CCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 has a property value of -0.86208673.
- CCN2c1ncccc1N(CC)C(=O)c3cccnc23 has a property value of -0.88654936.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups in the target molecule, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value.

To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of a sulfur atom and a tert-butyl group suggests some degree of hydrophobicity, but the overall structure is more complex due to the heterocyclic ring and the presence of nitrogen and oxygen atoms, which can introduce polar characteristics.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar heterocyclic structures and functional groups, such as CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C, have a property value of -0.07427209. This suggests that the presence of a similar heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and sulfur atoms, along with a tert-butyl group, results in a slightly negative property value.

Therefore, based on the structural similarities and the examples provided, the predicted property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is approximately -0.07427209.

Given that CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a terminal bromine atom, it is most similar to the example with CI, which also has a terminal halogen and a property value of 2.12205963. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr is 2.12205963.
