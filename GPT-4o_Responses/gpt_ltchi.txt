Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a linear ester with a long carbon chain, specifically a decanoate ester.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- CCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC (a similar ester with a longer chain) has a property value of 889.28873773.
- CCCCCCC(=O)OC (a similar ester with a shorter chain) has a property value of -210.30999555.

The property values seem to increase with the length of the carbon chain in esters. Given that CCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is between these two examples in terms of chain length, we can predict that its property value will also be between -210.30999555 and 889.28873773.

Considering the trend, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be around 300.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a fused heterocyclic ring containing an oxygen and a nitrogen atom.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have a wide range of property values, often influenced by the number and position of chlorine atoms.
- The presence of heteroatoms like oxygen and nitrogen in a ring structure can also significantly affect the property value.

Given these observations, the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is somewhat similar to other chlorinated aromatic compounds with heteroatoms, such as Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (123.71328214) and Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 (-492.01052702). However, the presence of the heterocyclic structure with an oxygen and nitrogen atom might increase the property value compared to simpler chlorinated aromatics.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, tend to have negative property values. The presence of the nitro group, which is electron-withdrawing, likely contributes to this trend. Additionally, smaller hydrocarbons like CCC(C)CC have negative property values as well.

Considering these observations, the property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative. Given the structural similarity to other small hydrocarbons and nitro-containing compounds, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O would be around -300.0.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. The molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure, likely a steroid or similar compound, given the multiple fused rings and ketone groups.

From the examples, we can observe that larger, more complex molecules with multiple rings and functional groups tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule with the highest property value in the examples is CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C, which has a property value of 2247.60287677. This molecule is a polycyclic compound with multiple ketone groups, similar to the given molecule.

To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted benzamide with two fluorine atoms on one phenyl ring and a chloro-substituted phenyl ring connected through a urea linkage. The examples provided show that halogenated aromatic compounds and those with carbonyl groups tend to have negative property values, often influenced by the number and type of halogens and the presence of carbonyl groups.

True Property: -580.1297795600221
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the degree of branching.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a relatively small and simple molecule, consisting of a linear chain with an ether functional group and a branching methyl group. Comparing it to similar structures in the examples:

- CCCCCCO (hexanol) has a property value of -732.86052306.
- CCCCCC1CCCC1 (cyclohexane derivative) has a property value of 280.93150827.
- CCCCCC(C)O (a branched alcohol) has a property value of -567.08266857.

Given that CCCOC(C)C is an ether with a similar size and branching to some of these examples, we can estimate its property value to be in a similar range. Ethers generally have property values that are less negative than alcohols due to the absence of hydrogen bonding.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C would be around -600.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. The presence of a bromine atom and carbonyl groups can significantly influence the property value, as seen in the examples.

Looking at the examples:
- Molecules with halogens (Cl, Br) and carbonyl groups tend to have property values in the range of -100 to 1000.
- The presence of a bromine atom, as in CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, which has a property value of -108.15805612, suggests that the bromine atom contributes to a lower property value.
- The presence of carbonyl groups, as in COc2cnc1cncnc1n2 with a property value of -377.76816609, also suggests a tendency towards lower property values.

Considering these factors, the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O is likely to have a property value that is negative and possibly in the range of -100 to -400, given the influence of the bromine and carbonyl groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately -250.

To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some form of energy or stability measure.

Biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic compound consisting of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples, we have:

- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 with a property value of 404.77282445, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.
- Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O with a property value of 69.49093044, which is a simpler aromatic compound with a sulfonamide group.
- Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34 with a property value of 912.12480066, which is a larger polycyclic aromatic compound.

Biphenyl is simpler than the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but more complex than a single benzene ring. Given the examples, biphenyl's property value should be lower than the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but higher than a single benzene ring with additional functional groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around 200.

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -677.1073948839634
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the molecule CCCCCS based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples. The examples provided include a variety of hydrocarbons, aromatic compounds, and functionalized molecules with different substituents, each associated with a specific property value.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear alkane with a thiol group (sulfur atom) at the end. This structure is similar to simple alkanes but with the addition of a sulfur atom, which can influence the property value due to its electronegativity and ability to form different types of interactions compared to carbon and hydrogen.

In the examples, simple alkanes like CCCCCCC(C)C have property values around -208.09120506, while functionalized alkanes with additional atoms or groups (like halogens or oxygen) tend to have more positive or negative values depending on the nature of the substituents.

Considering the presence of sulfur, which is less electronegative than oxygen but more than carbon, and its potential to form weak hydrogen bonds or dipole interactions, the property value for CCCCCS is likely to be slightly more positive than a simple alkane but not as high as those with strongly electronegative or multiple functional groups.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be around -150.0.

The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the degree of branching.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with the structure of 2-methyl-2-pentanol. It is similar to the example CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O, which is a cyclic alcohol with a property value of 221.18528655. However, CCCC(C)(C)CO is a simpler, non-cyclic alcohol with a similar degree of branching.

Considering the examples, the presence of an alcohol group generally increases the property value compared to alkanes, but the degree of branching and the absence of additional complex functional groups suggest a moderate property value.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO would be around 200.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 (a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon) has a property value of 404.77282445.
- Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 (another naphthalene derivative) has a property value of -11.10998725.

The structure of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is similar to Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12, but without the additional methyl group on the second aromatic ring. Given the similarity in structure, we can expect the property value to be close to that of Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 would be slightly lower than -11.10998725, as the removal of a methyl group typically results in a decrease in the property value. A predicted value could be around -20.0.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic urea, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -202.88577786. The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the given molecule, which could potentially increase the property value due to the added hydrophobic interactions and increased molecular size.

Considering the structural similarity and the effect of the additional alkyl chain, the property value for the given molecule is likely to be slightly higher than -202.88577786. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be around -150.0.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have negative property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of -256.08037936, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1137.59242163, which is an exception due to the high number of chlorine atoms.

Considering the electron-withdrawing nature of the trifluoromethyl group and the aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be negative. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around -500.

3. **Prediction**:
   - The nitro group generally contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in the examples.
   - The acetamide group is less electronegative than the nitro group, so it might slightly offset the negative contribution.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is likely to be in the range of the more negative values due to the nitro group, but not as negative as the simplest nitrobenzene due to the presence of the acetamide group.

Another example, Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, has a property value of 888.99010461, and it contains aromatic rings and nitro groups.

Considering the presence of the sulfonamide group, which is similar to the nitro group in terms of electron-withdrawing properties, and the aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be positive but not as high as those with multiple aromatic rings or additional electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 would be around 200 to 400. Given the examples and the structural features, a specific prediction could be approximately 300.

True Property: 907.0838399621643
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with negative property values.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which is also present in some examples and tends to contribute to a more negative property value.
- An alkene group (C=C) in the side chain, which is less common in the examples but can influence the property value.

Based on the examples, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group further suggests a negative value, as seen in other examples with similar groups.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative and in the range of other nitroaromatic compounds with additional electron-withdrawing groups.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -1011.3102921632682
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl acetate, an ester.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Esters like CCC(C)C1(CC=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O have a property value of 420.65628377.
2. The molecule CCC(C)(C)O, which is a simple alcohol, has a property value of -833.48874972.
3. The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, which is an ester with an aromatic ring, has a property value of -210.60959396.
4. The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)C, which is a ketone, has a property value of 0.14979921.

Considering the structure of isopropyl acetate, it is a small ester without any aromatic rings or additional functional groups that might significantly alter its property value. It is more similar to the simpler esters and alcohols in the examples.

Given these observations, the property value for CC(C)OC=O is likely to be closer to the simpler esters and alcohols. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around -300.0.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -550.8872788980608
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to the structure of c1ccccc1O (phenol) with an additional methyl group.

The property value for phenol (c1ccccc1O) is given as -896.61682568. The addition of a methyl group generally increases the property value due to increased molecular weight and potential changes in electronic distribution.

Looking at the examples, the addition of alkyl groups (like methyl) tends to increase the property value, but the effect is not very large. For instance, comparing benzene (c1ccccc1) with toluene (Cc1ccccc1), the property value increases slightly.

Therefore, considering the structural similarity and the effect of the methyl group, I would predict the property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 to be slightly higher than that of phenol. A reasonable estimate would be around -850.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate groups in the examples COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl. These examples have property values of 1605.00937205, 1725.28751349, and 1430.31351677, respectively.

The molecule in question also contains a methoxy group (OC) and a thiomethyl group (SC) attached to a benzene ring, which is similar to the structure of the examples. However, the halogen substituents in the examples (Cl, Br, I) are replaced by a thiomethyl group in the target molecule, which may affect the property value.

Considering the structural similarities and differences, the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be in a similar range to the examples with phosphorothioate groups, but slightly lower due to the absence of halogens, which tend to increase the property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is approximately 1350.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound with multiple chlorine atoms attached to two fused benzene rings. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings.

For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1137.59242163, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1343.67315432. These examples suggest that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings contributes to a higher property value.

Given the structure of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, which is a chlorinated biphenyl with a high degree of chlorination, we can predict that its property value will be in a similar range to the examples with high chlorine content and aromaticity.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be approximately 1200.0.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -1000.0820098527237
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple nitroalkane, specifically nitropropane.

Looking at the examples, we can see that the property values seem to be influenced by the presence of functional groups, molecular size, and complexity. For instance, smaller and simpler molecules tend to have more negative property values, while larger and more complex molecules have higher values.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is relatively small and simple, similar to other small aliphatic compounds in the list. For example, CCC (propane) has a property value of -1199.71127271, and CCCC (butane) has a property value of 63.04749582. The presence of the nitro group (N(=O)=O) in CCCN(=O)=O will likely increase the property value compared to a simple alkane due to its electron-withdrawing nature and added molecular complexity.

Considering these factors, the property value for CCCN(=O)=O is likely to be less negative than that of propane (CCC) but still negative due to its relatively small size and simplicity compared to larger, more complex molecules. A reasonable estimate for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around -1000.0.

The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence and type of functional groups, as well as the overall molecular size and complexity.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent. This structure is similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, which has a property value of -376.3585208. The main difference between these two molecules is the substitution of a chlorine atom with a fluorine atom.

Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which could slightly affect the property value. However, given the similarity in structure and the examples provided, the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is likely to be close to that of Clc1ccc(Br)cc1.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be approximately -376.3585208, with a slight adjustment to account for the substitution of fluorine for chlorine. A predicted value could be around -380.0, considering the potential influence of fluorine's electronegativity.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. This molecule is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group, similar to some of the examples given.

The examples show a range of property values, and the values seem to be influenced by the size of the molecule, the presence of functional groups, and the overall complexity of the structure. For instance, larger and more complex molecules tend to have higher property values.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is relatively small and less complex compared to some of the larger examples with high property values. It is similar in size and complexity to molecules like CC1CCCO1 (-738.48341635) and CC(C)(C)CO (-881.67807109), which are also small cyclic or bicyclic compounds with alcohol groups.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is likely to be in a similar range to these examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately -800.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is a phosphorothioate with a cyclic amide (lactam) structure, similar to some of the examples given.

One of the examples, CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, has a property value of 3143.03423032. This molecule is similar in structure, as it also contains a phosphorothioate group and a cyclic amide, but it has an additional sulfur-containing side chain.

Given the structural similarity but the absence of the additional sulfur-containing side chain in the molecule we are predicting for, we can expect the property value to be somewhat lower than 3143.03423032. However, it should still be relatively high due to the presence of the phosphorothioate and cyclic amide groups.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be approximately 2800.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule CN2C(=C(O)c1ccccc1S2(=O)=O)C(=O)Nc3ccccn3, which has a property value of 1617.19368344. However, the example molecule is more complex and contains additional functional groups, which likely contribute to its higher property value.

Another example, CNc1ccccc1, has a property value of -675.04761507. This molecule is simpler and contains a nitrogen atom attached to a benzene ring, similar to the target molecule, but lacks the carbonyl group and the second aromatic ring.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of the carbonyl group and nitrogen heterocycle, the property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is likely to be between the values of the simpler and more complex examples. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around 200 to 400.

Therefore, a predicted property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C could be approximately 300.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate. It has a linear alkyl chain with seven carbon atoms and an ester functional group. Comparing it to similar structures in the examples:

1. CCCCCCC(=O)OC (octanoate ester) has a property value of 257.90935347.
2. CCCCCC (hexane) has a property value of -778.7916832.
3. CCCCCCCCI (iodoheptane) has a property value of 309.59530841.

Considering the structure of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, it is similar to the octanoate ester but with one less carbon in the alkyl chain. The property value should be slightly lower than that of the octanoate ester due to the shorter chain length.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be slightly below 257.90935347. Therefore, a predicted property value could be approximately:

True Property: -1107.6226535009166
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, also known as 1,3-butadiene.

Looking at the examples, simpler hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values. For instance, CC/C=C/C (a linear hydrocarbon with a double bond) has a property value of -942.1820978, and C=Cc1ccccc1 (a styrene-like structure) has a property value of -697.38858521. These values suggest that the presence of double bonds and a relatively simple structure contribute to a negative property value.

Given that C=CCC=C is a simple diene without additional functional groups or aromatic rings, it is reasonable to predict a property value in the negative range, similar to other simple hydrocarbons with double bonds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C would be approximately -800.

However, BrC(Br)Br is even simpler, with fewer atoms and no additional functional groups beyond the bromines.

Given the simplicity and the presence of multiple bromine atoms, which are heavy and electronegative, we can expect the property value to be negative, similar to other small halogenated compounds. Considering the trend in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around -700.0.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings and chlorine substituents tend to have negative property values. For instance:
- Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of -492.01052702.
- Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 has a property value of 325.8614354.

The molecule in question, Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, has two aromatic rings, each with chlorine substituents, and an ether linkage between the rings. This structure is more complex than the simple dichlorobenzene but less complex than the biphenyl with additional substituents.

Considering these factors, the property value is likely to be negative and somewhat similar to the dichlorobenzene example, but possibly slightly more negative due to the additional complexity and the presence of the ether linkage.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately -500.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the types of atoms involved.

The molecule CCCOCC is a linear chain with an ether functional group (R-O-R') and consists of 5 carbon atoms and 1 oxygen atom. Comparing it to similar structures in the examples:

- CCC(O)CC has a property value of -747.35089634. This molecule is similar in size and contains an alcohol group instead of an ether.
- C1CCCCCC1, a cyclohexane, has a property value of -321.76290158. This molecule is similar in size but lacks the oxygen atom.
- CCC#C, a smaller molecule with a triple bond, has a property value of -1227.01980159.

Considering these comparisons, the presence of the ether group in CCCOCC is likely to result in a property value that is less negative than CCC(O)CC due to the absence of the hydroxyl group, which is more polar than an ether. However, it should be more negative than C1CCCCCC1 due to the presence of the oxygen atom, which contributes to a more negative property value.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be around -500.0.

2. The presence of alkyl groups like isopropyl (CC(C)) or butyl (CCCC) can influence the property value, as seen in CC(C)CO (-1003.99922394) and CC(C)CCO (-793.53942918).

Considering these observations, the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 has a benzene ring and an isobutyl group. The property value is likely to be similar to other benzene-containing molecules, slightly adjusted for the isobutyl group.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is approximately -700.0.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -770.0165893561809
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some similar structures:

1. NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (benzamide) has a property value of -619.03469019.
2. COc1ccccc1 (anisole) has a property value of -732.97775294.
3. O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O (dinitrobenzene) has a property value of -530.17677119.
4. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (hexachlorobenzene) has a property value of -141.41129961.

Benzaldehyde is structurally similar to these compounds, particularly to benzamide and anisole, as it contains a benzene ring with a functional group attached. The presence of the carbonyl group (C=O) in benzaldehyde is similar to the carbonyl group in benzamide, but benzaldehyde lacks the additional amide group.

Considering these comparisons, benzaldehyde is likely to have a property value that is less negative than benzamide but more negative than anisole, due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the aldehyde group compared to the methoxy group in anisole.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) would be approximately -650.0.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: 80.71928672108382
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group and an oxazole ring. The presence of these functional groups can significantly influence the property value. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups and heterocycles tend to have property values that are either moderately positive or negative, depending on the overall structure and other substituents.

For instance, the molecule Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 has a nitro group and a property value of 600.17641483. On the other hand, Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, which is a heterocyclic compound, has a property value of -356.55063577.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of both a nitro group and a heterocyclic ring in the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, the property value is likely to be influenced by these features. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be moderately positive, reflecting the balance between the electron-withdrawing nitro group and the heterocyclic structure.

Therefore, a predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 could be approximately 300.

True Property: 129.19654258735747
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diaryl hydrazine, which is similar to the example N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 with a property value of 85.9317314. The main difference between the two is the presence of a double bond in the example, which is absent in the target molecule.

The removal of the double bond in the target molecule results in a more saturated structure, which typically affects the property value. Given the examples, the property values for aromatic compounds with similar structures tend to be in the range of -500 to 200. Considering the structural similarity to the example with a value of 85.9317314, and accounting for the absence of the double bond, the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be slightly lower.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is approximately 50.

The molecule in question, O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, is a bicyclic compound with two amide groups and a cyclopentane ring.

From the examples provided, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with multiple rings and amide groups, such as O=C1N(COC(=O)CC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3, tend to have higher property values (e.g., 1572.6448308).
2. Smaller cyclic amides, like O=C1CCCN1, have lower property values (e.g., -885.27703048).

The given molecule has a structure that is more complex than a simple cyclic amide but less complex than the larger polycyclic structures with aromatic rings. It is a bicyclic compound with two amide groups, which suggests a moderate property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 would be around 500. This is a rough estimate based on the structural complexity and the presence of functional groups compared to the examples provided.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have negative property values. For instance:
   - Clc1ccccc1Cl has a property value of -548.53598718.
   - Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a property value of 1296.03874641, but this is a more complex structure with multiple chlorines and a trichloromethyl group.

2. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the magnitude of the property value, either positively or negatively, depending on the specific structure.

3. The biphenyl structure itself, without additional functional groups, tends to have a property value closer to zero, as seen in c2ccc1scnc1c2 with a value of -267.61783712.

Considering these points, the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, with three chlorine atoms on a biphenyl structure, is likely to have a property value that is negative and of a larger magnitude than Clc1ccccc1Cl due to the additional chlorine atoms.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be approximately -600.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -135.42704033517035
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically 1,3-diethylbenzene.

Looking at the examples, we can see that simple aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions tend to have negative property values. For instance, Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) has a property value of -693.84512575, and Cc1cc(no1)C(=O)NNCc2ccccc2 (a more complex aromatic compound) has a property value of 418.87454979. The property values seem to become more negative with simpler structures and less negative with more complex or functionalized structures.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a relatively simple aromatic compound with two ethyl groups, it is likely to have a property value that is negative but not as negative as the simplest aromatic compounds like benzene derivatives without additional functional groups.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be around -600. This is consistent with the trend observed in the examples, where simple alkyl-substituted aromatics have moderately negative property values.

Looking at the examples, the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -659.00472518. This molecule is a nitrobenzene, which is structurally similar to the sulfonamide group in terms of electron-withdrawing effects. The sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is also an electron-withdrawing group, similar to the nitro group (N(=O)=O).

Given the structural similarity and the electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O will be in a similar range to that of nitrobenzene derivatives. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be approximately -659.00472518.

- c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54 with a property value of 1141.3821061

Both of these examples are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons with multiple fused benzene rings. The molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 is also a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a similar number of rings and aromatic character.

Given the structural similarity and the property values of the examples, we can predict that the property value for c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 will be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately 1100.0.

The molecule in question, Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, appears to be a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. This structure suggests a relatively high level of complexity and potential for resonance stabilization, similar to some of the higher values in the examples.

Given the presence of multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups, which can contribute to resonance and hydrogen bonding, the property value is likely to be on the higher end of the spectrum provided in the examples. Comparing it to similar structures in the list, such as those with multiple aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value might be around 1300 to 1500.

Therefore, a predicted property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 could be approximately 1400.

These groups are similar to those found in some of the examples, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl and COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, which have high property values (1430.31 and 1471.51, respectively).

2. **Comparison with Examples**: The presence of the thiophosphate group suggests a higher property value, as seen in the examples with similar groups. However, the molecule is smaller and less complex than the examples with very high values, which suggests a lower value than those.

3. **Size and Complexity**: The molecule is relatively small compared to some of the larger, more complex structures with very high property values. This suggests a moderate property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is likely to be in the mid-range, not as high as the most complex examples but higher than simpler hydrocarbons or small aromatic compounds.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is approximately **1200**.

True Property: -1016.3934041463323
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1, which is pyridine, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. Pyridine is an aromatic heterocycle similar to benzene but with one nitrogen atom replacing a CH group.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as pyridine derivatives, tend to have property values that are negative but not extremely low. For instance, the compound c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 has a property value of 113.87985749, which is positive, but this compound is more complex than pyridine.

Considering the simpler structure of pyridine compared to the more complex aromatic heterocycles in the examples, and the fact that pyridine is less complex than many of the other molecules with positive values, we can infer that the property value for pyridine should be negative but not as low as some of the more complex or heavily substituted aromatic compounds.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of pyridine (c1ccncc1) would be around -100.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure, consisting of a chloroethane (ethyl chloride) group. In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules tend to have more negative property values. For instance, CCC (propane) has a property value of -778.7916832, and Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) has a property value of -752.09833096.

Given that ClCC is a small and relatively simple molecule, we can expect its property value to be in the negative range, similar to other small molecules in the examples.

The molecule in question has a pyridine ring, which is similar to a benzene ring but with a nitrogen atom, and a trichloromethyl group, which is similar to the examples with multiple chlorine atoms. The presence of the nitrogen atom in the pyridine ring may slightly lower the property value compared to a fully chlorinated benzene ring.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl would likely be in the range of the examples with multiple chlorine atoms, but slightly lower due to the pyridine ring. A reasonable estimate would be around 400 to 500.

The molecule in question has six chlorine atoms, while the example has ten chlorine atoms. The property value is likely related to the degree of chlorination and the overall molecular structure.

Given that the molecule in question is less chlorinated than the example, we can expect its property value to be lower. However, it is still a highly chlorinated biphenyl, so the value will be relatively high compared to less chlorinated or non-chlorinated compounds.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately 1500.

To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (CO) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) also attached to the ring.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitro groups tend to have negative property values. For instance, O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -532.6951601, and c1ccccc1O has a property value of -896.61682568. The presence of the methoxy group, which is an electron-donating group, might slightly increase the property value compared to a simple nitrobenzene.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is likely to be negative and somewhat similar to the values of other nitroaromatic compounds. A reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -600.

Considering the linear structure and the presence of the ester group, the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is likely to be influenced by the length of the carbon chain and the ester functionality. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around 200 to 300, as it is a relatively simple aliphatic ester with a long carbon chain.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 250.

1. The presence of a nitro group (N(=O)=O) on a benzene ring, as seen in the example Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which has a property value of -567.53556067.
2. The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) on a benzene ring, as seen in the example NC(=O)c1ccccc1O, which has a property value of -619.03469019.

The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O combines both a nitro group and a hydroxyl group on a benzene ring. Given the negative property values associated with both functional groups in the examples, we can expect the property value for nitrophenol to also be negative.

Considering the examples and the structural similarities, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be approximately -600.0. This value is an estimate based on the trends observed in the examples provided.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. This molecule is a complex sugar, likely a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide, given its multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic acetal structures.

From the examples, it appears that the property values are influenced by the molecular complexity, presence of functional groups, and overall molecular weight. Larger and more complex molecules with multiple functional groups tend to have higher property values.

Given the structure of the molecule in question, which is a large and complex sugar with multiple hydroxyl groups, I would predict a relatively high property value. However, it is not as high as the largest molecules in the examples, which include multiple aromatic rings and halogen substitutions.

Based on these considerations, I would predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately 2500.

The molecule CCC#C is a simple alkyne, specifically 1-butyne, with a linear structure and a triple bond. In the examples, simpler molecules with fewer functional groups and lower molecular weights tend to have more negative property values. For instance, CCC(C)C(=O)C has a property value of -664.5999623, and CCC(C)OC=O has a property value of -1011.31029216.

Given the simplicity and small size of CCC#C compared to the other molecules, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is negative and possibly in the range of other small hydrocarbons or simple functionalized hydrocarbons.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C is approximately -700.0.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 2780.5857532.
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to the example Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl with a property value of 1137.59242163.

Considering these structural similarities, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the chlorinated aromatic ring suggests that the property value will be influenced by both the high value associated with the phosphorothioate group and the moderate value associated with the chlorinated aromatic ring.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl would be around 2000. This value accounts for the significant contribution of the phosphorothioate group while also considering the effect of the chlorinated aromatic ring.

To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a pyridine derivative with a hydrazide group attached to the carbonyl.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of nitrogen-containing heterocycles, carbonyl groups, and hydrazide-like structures tend to have property values that are positive and relatively moderate in magnitude. For instance, the molecule Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2 has a property value of -548.851673, which is negative, but it is a more complex structure with additional nitrogen atoms.

Given the simpler structure of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 compared to some of the more complex examples, and considering the presence of a carbonyl and hydrazide group, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be a small positive number, reflecting the moderate complexity and functional groups present.

Therefore, a predicted property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 could be approximately 50.0.

- Alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)

Comparing these features to the examples:

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (n-octane), we can analyze the trends in the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the size and complexity of the molecules.

In the examples, linear alkanes and simple alcohols tend to have negative property values, and the values become more negative as the chain length increases. For instance:

- CCCCCC (hexane) has a property value of -311.94093355.
- CCCCCC(C)C (heptane) would likely have a more negative value than hexane.

Given that CCCCCCCC (octane) is a straight-chain alkane with a longer chain than hexane, we can predict that its property value will be more negative than that of hexane.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (octane) would be approximately -400.0.

Considering the structure of Oc1ccccc1Cl, which is a chlorophenol, it is likely to have a property value between those of simple halogenated benzenes and nitrophenols. Given the presence of both a hydroxyl group and a chlorine atom, the property value is expected to be less negative than that of a nitrophenol but more negative than that of a simple chlorobenzene.

- An amide linkage (OC(=O)N), which is present in several molecules with varying property values.
- An alkyne group (C#C), which is not explicitly present in the examples but can be considered as a feature that might lower the property value due to its unsaturation and linearity.

Considering these features, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in the examples. The amide linkage and the alkyne group might moderate this increase. 

Based on the examples, particularly the high property values associated with multiple chlorine atoms and the presence of aromatic rings, I would predict a relatively high property value for this molecule, but not as high as the fully chlorinated aromatic systems.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCOC=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values.

The molecule CCCCCOC=O is a linear chain with an ester functional group. It is similar to the example molecule CCCCCCC=O, which has a property value of -594.91558299. The main difference is that CCCCCOC=O has an additional oxygen atom due to the ester linkage, which might slightly alter the property value.

Considering the structural similarity and the presence of the ester group, the property value for CCCCCOC=O is likely to be close to that of CCCCCCC=O, but slightly more negative due to the additional oxygen. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be approximately -600.0.

Given that ClCCl is a smaller molecule with one less carbon atom, we can expect its property value to be slightly different. In the examples, smaller molecules or those with fewer atoms tend to have more negative property values. Therefore, we can predict that the property value for ClCCl will be slightly more negative than that of ClCCCl.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be approximately -950.0.

Considering the structure of Cc1cccc(C)c1O, which is similar to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O with a property value of -151.28358897, we can infer that the presence of the hydroxyl group and the methyl group on the benzene ring will result in a property value that is likely negative but not as negative as simpler phenols without additional alkyl groups.

Therefore, based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be approximately -150.0.

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 727.9493451601973
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl, which is similar in structure to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 939.06685565.
2. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1137.59242163.
3. Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of -82.36745055.

The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a biphenyl with four chlorine atoms, similar to the first example but with a different arrangement of chlorine atoms. The property values for chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to be positive and increase with the number of chlorine atoms.

Considering the structural similarity to the first example and the number of chlorine atoms, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl would be slightly lower than 939.06685565, as it has fewer chlorine atoms than the second example but more than the third.

Therefore, a predicted property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl could be approximately 900.0.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -1009.5348178854373
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple hydrocarbon with a branched structure and a double bond.

Looking at the examples, we notice that simple hydrocarbons with linear or branched structures, such as CCCCCCC (octane) and CCCCCCCC=C (nonene), have property values of -147.41229893 and 109.09180543, respectively. The presence of a double bond in nonene increases the property value compared to octane.

Isoprene, with its branched structure and a double bond, is somewhat similar to nonene but smaller in size. Given the trend that the presence of a double bond increases the property value, we can expect the property value for isoprene to be slightly higher than that of a simple alkane but lower than that of a larger alkene like nonene.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C (isoprene) would be around 0, considering it is smaller than nonene but has a similar structural feature (the double bond) that increases the property value compared to a saturated hydrocarbon.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -1120.0085114355047
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we need to consider the trends and patterns in the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall complexity of the molecule.

The molecule ClCCl is dichloromethane, a simple molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples provided, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have more negative property values, likely due to the electronegativity and electron-withdrawing nature of chlorine.

For instance, the molecule ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of -735.19566251, and Oc1cccc(Cl)c1 has a property value of -695.5728708. These examples suggest that the presence of chlorine contributes to a more negative property value.

Given that ClCCl is a small and relatively simple molecule with two chlorine atoms, we can predict that its property value will be negative, but not as negative as the more complex chlorinated compounds in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around -500.0.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -285.9297943322667
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of chlorine atoms generally contributes to a more negative property value. For instance, Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of -288.44818324. The molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl has a similar structure but with an additional chlorine atom, which suggests that the property value will be more negative due to the increased electronegativity and molecular weight.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl would be slightly more negative than -288.44818324. Therefore, a predicted property value could be approximately -350.0.

True Property: 4004.0884119254965
Predicted Property:
Predicting the specific property value for the given molecule based on the examples provided is a complex task, as it involves understanding the relationship between molecular structure and the property in question. The examples suggest that the property values are likely related to some form of energy calculation, possibly related to molecular stability or reactivity.

The given molecule, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and hydroxyl groups. This complexity suggests a relatively high property value, similar to other large, complex molecules in the examples.

Based on the examples, particularly those with complex polycyclic structures and multiple functional groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be in the range of 1500 to 2500. Given the specific structural features and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, a predicted property value could be approximately:

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 475.4030430300521
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule contains a thioether group (CS), a pyrazole ring (1,2,4-triazole-like structure), a carbonyl group (C=O), and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C).

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with similar heterocyclic structures and functional groups tend to have property values in a certain range. For instance, the molecule CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a property value of 808.40217094, which includes a similar heterocyclic structure and a tert-butyl group.

Considering the structural similarities and the presence of the tert-butyl group, which tends to increase the property value, we can predict that the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C will be in a similar range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is approximately 808.40217094.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -294.5235917532981
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ester group (COOC) attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings and ester groups tend to have property values that are not extremely high or low. For instance, the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 has a property value of 2118.87060114, but it contains additional functional groups that likely contribute to the higher value.

Considering simpler aromatic esters, such as CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, which has a property value of -84.80671162, we can infer that the presence of the ester group and the benzene ring in ethyl benzoate will result in a property value that is not too far from this range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around -100. This value reflects the influence of the ester group and the aromatic ring, without additional complex functional groups that would significantly alter the property value.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 139.49632952630054
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the presence of halogens.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached, making it a bromoalkane. In the examples, we have a similar structure, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which is a brominated aromatic compound with a property value of 13.86349831. However, CCCCCCCBr is an aliphatic compound, not aromatic, and is more similar to the linear alkanes and their derivatives.

Considering the examples of linear alkanes and their derivatives:
- CCCCCCCCO has a property value of -311.94093355.
- CCCCCCC(=O)C has a property value of -420.76979031.

The presence of bromine, a heavy halogen, typically increases the property value compared to similar alkanes without halogens. Therefore, we can expect the property value of CCCCCCCBr to be slightly higher than that of CCCCCCCCO due to the presence of bromine.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around -300.

SMILES: CO
True Property: -1606.7405018213044
Predicted Property:
Predicting the specific property value for carbon monoxide (CO) based on the examples provided is challenging without knowing the exact property being measured. However, given the context and the nature of the examples, it seems that the property could be related to some form of energy calculation, such as enthalpy, Gibbs free energy, or another thermodynamic property.

Carbon monoxide is a small, simple molecule, and based on the trend of smaller, simpler molecules having more negative values in the examples, I would predict that CO would have a relatively negative property value. However, without more specific information about the property, it's difficult to provide an exact number.

If I were to make an educated guess based on the examples, I would predict a value around -1100, considering the trend of small molecules like CCC (-1199.71127271) and CCBr (-912.80264425). Therefore, a reasonable prediction for CO could be approximately:

-1100.0
