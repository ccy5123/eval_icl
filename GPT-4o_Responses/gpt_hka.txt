SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: -0.53
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly indicating a type of physicochemical property such as hydrophobicity, solubility, or a similar characteristic. The examples show that longer carbon chains with ester groups tend to have negative values, and the presence of certain functional groups like halogens or aromatic rings can significantly affect the value.

The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a long-chain ester, similar to CCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which has a property value of -0.53. Given that the molecule in question has a slightly longer carbon chain, it is reasonable to predict a similar or slightly more negative value due to increased hydrophobicity.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is approximately -0.53.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -1.2199999999999998
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an amide group. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings and heteroatoms, which tend to have negative property values.

For instance, the molecule c1cncnc1 has a property value of -0.92, and it is a simple aromatic heterocycle. The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 has additional chlorine substitution, which in some examples (e.g., Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl with a property value of 0.47) can lead to positive values, but in this case, the presence of the amide group and the overall structure suggests a more negative value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around -1.0.

Iteration: 3
SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6000000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite, which contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O).

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO (-1.43), tend to have negative property values. The presence of the nitro group is a significant factor contributing to the negative value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

Additionally, the isopropyl group is a small alkyl group, which generally has a less significant impact on the property value compared to the nitro group. For instance, simple alkyl chains like CCC(C)CC (0.0) have values around zero, but the presence of the nitro group will likely dominate the effect.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O would be around -1.0, reflecting the influence of the nitro group.

True Property: -1.0000000000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO

This molecule is a polycyclic compound with multiple rings and carbonyl groups, similar to some of the more complex structures in the examples. Notably, it resembles steroid-like structures, which are often associated with negative property values due to their complex, multi-ring systems and the presence of carbonyl groups.

Looking at the examples, complex polycyclic structures with carbonyl groups, such as:

- CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C, which has a property value of -0.92
- C1c2ccccc2c3ccc4ccccc4c13, which has a property value of -2.08

These examples suggest that the presence of multiple rings and carbonyl groups tends to result in a negative property value. Given the structural complexity and the presence of carbonyl groups in the molecule CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, it is reasonable to predict a similar negative property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -1.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

This molecule contains:
- A fluorinated benzene ring (similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.99).
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N) which is a common feature in several molecules with negative property values.
- A chlorinated benzene ring (similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -0.2).

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like fluorine and chlorine, along with the amide linkage, suggests that the molecule is likely to have a negative property value. The combination of these features in the examples generally leads to a negative value, often in the range of -0.9 to -1.5.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be approximately -1.10.

Iteration: 6
SMILES: CCCOC(C)C
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with a linear chain and a branching methyl group. 

Looking at the examples, simple linear and branched alkanes and ethers tend to have property values around 0.0 or slightly negative. For instance, CCCCCO has a property value of -0.04, and CCCCCC1CCCC1 has a property value of 0.0. These examples suggest that simple aliphatic chains with or without oxygen atoms tend to have property values close to zero.

Given the structure of CCCOC(C)C, which is similar to these examples, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be around 0.0. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is:

0.0

True Property: -0.8400000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with two carbonyl groups and a bromine atom. The presence of carbonyl groups typically contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in several examples with carbonyl groups. The bromine atom can also contribute to a more negative value, as halogens often do, but to a lesser extent than carbonyl groups.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar features, such as halogens and carbonyl groups, tend to have negative property values. For instance, CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of -0.83, and it contains both a carbonyl and a bromine atom. Another example, Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, has a property value of -0.69, with multiple halogens but no carbonyl groups.

Considering these observations, the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O is likely to have a property value in the negative range, influenced by the carbonyl groups and the bromine atom. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -1.0.

Iteration: 8
SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -1.5599999999999996
Predicted Property:
The molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 represents biphenyl, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. Based on the examples provided, the property values seem to be related to the hydrophobicity or lipophilicity of the molecules, possibly logP values. Aromatic compounds with multiple phenyl rings tend to have more negative values due to their hydrophobic nature.

Given the structure of biphenyl and comparing it to similar aromatic compounds in the examples, such as Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O (-1.07) and Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34 (-2.54), biphenyl is expected to have a property value that is less negative than the latter but possibly more negative than the former due to the absence of additional functional groups that might increase hydrophilicity.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around -1.5.

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.35
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the examples provided and identify patterns or trends in the data. The examples include a variety of molecular structures with different functional groups and their corresponding property values.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear alkane chain with a sulfur atom at the end. In the examples, linear alkanes such as CCCCCCC=C and CCCCCC(C)C have property values of -0.26 and 0.0, respectively. The presence of a sulfur atom, which is less electronegative than oxygen and nitrogen, might slightly affect the property value compared to a pure hydrocarbon chain.

Considering the examples and the nature of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be slightly negative, similar to other simple aliphatic chains with minor modifications. Therefore, I would predict the property value for CCCCCS to be approximately -0.1.
==================================================
Iteration: 10
SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly indicating a measure of hydrophobicity or lipophilicity, such as a logP value. 

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with a tertiary butyl group and a primary alcohol group. In the examples, similar aliphatic alcohols and hydrocarbons, such as CCC(C)(C)C and CC(C)CC(C)O, have property values around 0.0 or slightly negative. The presence of the alcohol group in CCCC(C)(C)CO might slightly decrease the hydrophobicity compared to a purely hydrocarbon structure.

Given this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO would be slightly negative, around -0.04.

Given the similarity in structure, particularly the presence of the naphthalene core and a methyl substituent, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 would be close to -1.3. Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is approximately -1.3.

True Property: -1.65
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a cyclic urea derivative with additional alkyl and alkenyl substituents. The examples provided show that cyclic urea derivatives tend to have negative property values, likely due to their polar nature and potential for hydrogen bonding. For instance, the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a property value of -1.65.

The molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C is similar but has a longer alkyl chain, which might slightly increase the property value due to increased hydrophobic character. However, the overall polar nature of the cyclic urea core is likely to dominate.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be slightly less negative than -1.65, but still negative. A predicted value could be around -1.5.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.9900000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Aromatic rings, such as benzene, tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of halogens (like Cl, Br, I) in aromatic compounds can lead to slightly positive or less negative values, depending on the specific structure and substitution pattern.
- The trifluoromethyl group is highly electronegative and can influence the property value by making it less negative or even slightly positive compared to a simple benzene ring.

Considering these factors, the trifluoromethyl group is likely to make the property value less negative compared to a simple benzene ring. However, it is unlikely to make it positive given the examples provided.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a sugar, specifically a hexose, which is similar to glucose. Sugars are generally polar due to the presence of multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups, which can form hydrogen bonds with water and other polar solvents.

Looking at the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a property value of -0.24. This suggests that the presence of hydroxyl groups contributes to a more negative property value, likely due to increased solubility or interaction with polar environments.

Given the structural similarity of OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O to the example with a property value of -0.24, we can predict that the property value for this molecule will be similar. Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately -0.24.

CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C

This molecule contains several key features:

1. **Carbonyl Groups (C=O):** The presence of multiple carbonyl groups suggests a potential for a more negative property value, as seen in other molecules with carbonyl groups.

2. **Cyclic Structure:** The molecule has a complex polycyclic structure, similar to some of the examples provided, which often have negative property values.

3. **Hydroxyl Groups (O):** The presence of hydroxyl groups can also contribute to a more negative property value due to increased polarity.

4. **Ester Linkage (CC(=O)O):** The ester linkage is another feature that can influence the property value, often contributing to a more negative value.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, particularly those with similar functional groups and structural complexity, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -1.2.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with multiple cyclohexane rings and a ketone group. It resembles a steroid-like structure, which is similar to some of the examples given, such as CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of -1.02.

Given the structural similarity, particularly the presence of multiple fused rings and a ketone group, the property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O is likely to be in a similar range. Therefore, I would predict the property value to be approximately -1.00.

SMILES: CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.91
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an acetanilide derivative with a nitro group attached to the aromatic ring.

1. **Functional Groups**: The molecule contains an amide group (CC(=O)N) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to a benzene ring. The presence of these groups can influence the property value.

2. **Comparison with Examples**:
   - The molecule O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 (nitrobenzene) has a property value of -1.38.
   - The molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (methoxy nitrobenzene) has a property value of -1.58.
   - The molecule O=C(Cn1ccnc1N(=O)=O)NCc2ccccc2 (a nitro-containing amide) has a property value of -2.7.

3. **Analysis**:
   - The nitro group is known to be electron-withdrawing, which generally leads to a more negative property value.
   - The amide group is also electron-withdrawing but less so than the nitro group.
   - The combination of these groups in the molecule suggests a property value that is likely more negative than nitrobenzene (-1.38) but not as negative as the more complex nitro-containing amide (-2.7).

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O would be around -1.6.

True Property: -0.3000000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which can contribute to a more negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
- An aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent, which is similar to some of the examples with chlorinated aromatic rings.
- An ester linkage (OCC), which is present in some of the examples with moderately negative property values.
- A thioether linkage (SC), which can also contribute to a more negative property value.

Based on the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups like chlorine tend to have property values in the range of -1.0 to -2.5. The presence of the phosphorothioate group and the thioether linkage suggests a more negative value within this range.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 would be approximately -2.1.

The molecule CC(C)(C)CO is tert-butyl alcohol. In the examples, alcohols and similar small, simple organic molecules like CCC (propane) and CC(C)CO (isobutanol) have property values around -0.04. Given that tert-butyl alcohol is similar in size and functional groups to these examples, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would also be around -0.04.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)(C)CO is -0.04.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is a bicyclic compound with two nitrogen-containing heterocycles, specifically a purine-like structure. This type of structure is similar to nucleobases, which are generally polar and have hydrogen bonding capabilities due to the presence of nitrogen atoms and carbonyl groups.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitrogen-containing heterocycles and carbonyl groups, such as Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F (-1.39) and COc2ncc1nccnc1n2 (-1.78), tend to have negative property values. These values suggest that the presence of nitrogen heterocycles and carbonyl groups contributes to a more negative property value, likely due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Given this analysis, the predicted property value for the molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is likely to be in the negative range. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction would be around -1.5. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.53
Predicted Property:
The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate. To predict its property value, we can look at similar structures and their known property values. 

The molecule CC(C)O (isopropanol) has a property value of -0.04. The addition of the ester functional group (OC=O) in isopropyl formate is likely to make the molecule slightly more polar than isopropanol, but not significantly so, as esters are relatively non-polar compared to other functional groups like alcohols or amides.

Considering the examples provided, molecules with similar small ester groups, such as CCC(C)C(=O)C (which has a property value of -0.33), suggest that the property value for CC(C)OC=O would be slightly negative, but not as negative as larger or more complex esters or ketones.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around -0.20.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diphenylurea, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a urea linkage.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings, especially those with electron-withdrawing groups like carbonyls or nitro groups, tend to have more negative property values.
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings generally contributes to a more negative property value.

Given these observations, the molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 has two phenyl rings and a urea linkage, which is somewhat similar to other aromatic compounds with carbonyl groups in the examples. The presence of two phenyl rings and the urea linkage suggests a relatively negative property value.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 would be around -1.4.

True Property: -1.5599999999999996
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The given molecule is triphenylene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a planar structure composed of three fused benzene rings.

Looking at the examples, we notice that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and similar aromatic systems tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1, which is a larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, has a property value of -2.34. 

Given that triphenylene is smaller and less complex than the example with a value of -2.34, but still an aromatic system, we can predict that its property value will also be negative, but not as negative as -2.34. A reasonable prediction, considering the trend and the size of the molecule, would be around -1.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 is approximately -1.5.

SMILES: NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 
True Property: -1.7599999999999998
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N), which is generally associated with polar and electron-withdrawing characteristics.
- An aromatic ring (phenyl group) with an amine substituent, which can contribute to electron-donating effects.
- An additional amine group attached to the sulfonamide, which can also contribute to electron-donating effects.

From the examples, molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro or multiple halogens tend to have more negative property values, while those with electron-donating groups or less polar structures tend to have less negative or even positive values.

Considering the presence of both electron-withdrawing (sulfonamide) and electron-donating (amine) groups, the property value is likely to be negative but not extremely so, as the electron-donating effects may partially offset the electron-withdrawing effects.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 would be around -1.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

This molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several molecules with negative property values.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which is an electron-withdrawing group and can contribute to a more negative property value.
- An alkene group (C=C) attached to the nitrogen, which is less common in the examples but can influence the property value.

Based on the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (-1.58) and Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O (-2.73), tend to have more negative property values.
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like trifluoromethyl can further decrease the property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O is likely to be quite negative. A reasonable estimate, given the structural features and comparison with similar molecules, would be around -2.5.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.53
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, the property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly indicating a measure of hydrophobicity or solubility, such as a logP value. The molecule in question, CC(C)OC=O, is an ester (isopropyl formate), which is relatively small and likely to be somewhat hydrophobic but not excessively so.

Looking at similar structures in the examples:
- CC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of -0.53.
- CCC(C)(C)O has a property value of -0.04.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is smaller than CC(C)CCOC=O and similar in size to CCC(C)(C)O. Given that esters are generally less hydrophobic than alkanes due to the presence of the carbonyl group, the property value for CC(C)OC=O is likely to be slightly more negative than that of CCC(C)(C)O.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around -0.20.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is structurally similar to c1ccccc1O (phenol), which has a property value of -0.98. The presence of an additional methyl group (C) in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 could slightly alter the property value, but it is likely to remain in a similar range due to the aromatic nature and the presence of the hydroxyl group.

Considering the examples and the structural similarity, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be around -0.90.

To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the functional group in several examples with positive property values, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl (0.65), COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl (0.9), and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (0.46). These examples suggest that the presence of the phosphorothioate group tends to contribute positively to the property value.

Additionally, the molecule has a methoxy group (OC) and a thiomethyl group (SC) attached to the aromatic ring. The presence of these groups, along with the methyl group (C), can influence the property value. The examples with similar aromatic structures and substituents, such as ClC=C(Cl)Cl (0.61) and ClCC(Cl)(Cl)Cl (1.16), also show positive property values.

Considering these structural similarities and the trends observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 will be positive, likely in the range of the other phosphorothioate-containing examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is approximately **0.5**.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: -0.11000000000000015
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the electronic and steric effects of the substituents on the aromatic rings, particularly focusing on the presence of halogens and other electron-withdrawing groups.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl, with multiple chlorine atoms attached to the aromatic rings. In the examples provided, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, have a positive property value of 0.47. Similarly, ClC(Cl)Cl, which is a simple chlorinated compound, has a property value of 0.87.

Given the pattern that more chlorination tends to increase the property value, and considering the structural similarity to the example with a property value of 0.47, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl will be positive and likely close to 0.47.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately 0.47.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6000000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to the end. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Simple aliphatic chains like CCC (propane) have a property value of 0.0.
- The presence of a nitro group tends to decrease the property value significantly, as seen in molecules with nitro groups such as CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O (-2.39) and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (-2.58).

Given that CCCN(=O)=O is a relatively simple molecule with a single nitro group, we can expect the property value to be negative, but not as low as more complex aromatic systems with multiple nitro groups. 

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around -1.0.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.3700000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a bromobenzene with a fluorine substituent, which is similar to the example Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, which has a property value of -0.01. The presence of a fluorine atom, which is more electronegative than chlorine, might slightly affect the property value, but not drastically.

Considering the examples and the structural similarity, the predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would likely be close to -0.01. However, due to the presence of fluorine, which could slightly increase the electron-withdrawing effect, the value might be slightly more negative. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be approximately -0.05.

Iteration: 32
SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group.

Looking at the examples, we notice that:

- Molecules with simple aliphatic structures and alcohol groups, such as CCCC(C)(C)O and CC(C)(C)CO, have property values around -0.04.
- The presence of a tertiary alcohol group in a relatively simple aliphatic structure tends to result in a property value close to -0.04.

Given that CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a relatively simple bicyclic structure with a tertiary alcohol, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar to those of the simple aliphatic alcohols.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is approximately -0.04.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: -1.07
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a phosphorothioate with an amide linkage to a benzene ring. It is similar in structure to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of -0.43. The main difference between the two molecules is the substitution of the thioester linkage (SC(CCl)) with a direct amide linkage (N2C(=O)).

The presence of the amide group, which is polar and can engage in hydrogen bonding, might slightly increase the negative property value compared to the thioester linkage. However, the overall structure remains quite similar, with the phosphorothioate and benzene ring being common features.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would likely be slightly more negative than -0.43, but not drastically different. A reasonable prediction would be around -0.50.

True Property: -1.7699999999999998
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of -2.42. Both molecules contain aromatic rings and nitrogen heterocycles, but the example molecule is more complex with additional aromatic rings and a ketone group.

Given the structural similarities and the presence of electron-withdrawing groups (carbonyl and nitrogen heterocycle), we can expect the property value to be in the negative range, similar to other aromatic and heterocyclic compounds in the examples.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be approximately -2.0.

Iteration: 35
SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.53
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which consists of a heptanoic acid moiety (CCCCCCC(=O)O) and an ethyl group (CC).

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Esters like CCOC(=O)N (with a property value of -0.73) and CCOC(=O)Nc2cccc(OC(=O)Nc1ccccc1)c2 (with a property value of -3.02) tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of a long alkyl chain, as seen in CCCCCCCCI (with a property value of 0.73), tends to increase the property value.
- The presence of an ester group, as seen in CCCCCCCC(=O)OC (with a property value of -0.53), suggests a negative property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar to CCCCCCCC(=O)OC, but with a slightly shorter alkyl chain. Therefore, we can predict that the property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC will be slightly less negative than -0.53, due to the shorter chain length.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be approximately -0.50.

Iteration: 36
SMILES: COC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -1.31
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a physicochemical property such as solubility, partition coefficient, or a similar parameter. The molecule in question, COC(=O)c1ccccc1, is methyl benzoate, an ester of benzoic acid.

Looking at the examples, aromatic compounds with ester groups tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCCCCCC has a property value of -1.84, and CCOC(=O)c1cccc(OC(=O)Nc2cccc(C)c2)c1 has a property value of -3.02. The presence of additional functional groups or longer alkyl chains seems to decrease the property value further.

Given that COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is a simpler ester with a single aromatic ring and no additional functional groups, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is less negative than those with more complex structures. Comparing it to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of -1.31, the absence of the ethyl group in COC(=O)c1ccccc1 might result in a slightly less negative value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around -1.20.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.52
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a physicochemical property such as logP (partition coefficient) or a similar measure of hydrophobicity or solubility. 

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, also known as 1,3-butadiene. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons or those with minimal functional groups tend to have property values around zero or slightly negative. For instance, CCC(C)(C)CC has a property value of 0.0, and CC/C=C/C has a value of -0.26.

Given the structure of 1,3-butadiene and its similarity to these examples, I would predict a property value slightly negative, reflecting its unsaturated nature and relatively low complexity.

Predicted property value for C=CCC=C: -0.2

Iteration: 38
SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 1.44
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their associated property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is tribromomethane, also known as bromoform. It is a simple molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples provided, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly bromine, tend to have negative property values, although the specific values can vary based on the overall structure and presence of other functional groups.

For instance, the molecule Ic1cccc2ccccc12, which contains iodine, has a property value of -0.57. Similarly, Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which contains chlorine, has a property value of -1.01. These examples suggest that the presence of halogens, especially in simple aromatic or non-aromatic structures, tends to result in negative property values.

Given the simplicity of BrC(Br)Br and the presence of three bromine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. However, the exact value would depend on the specific property being measured, which is not explicitly defined here. Based on the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around -0.5 to -1.0.

Therefore, a predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br could be approximately:

-0.75

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -0.1.
- A thioester linkage (SC(CCl)), which is a feature that can contribute to a more negative property value.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is similar to the presence of chlorine in other molecules with slightly positive or negative values.
- An imide group (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O), which is similar to the imide group in CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O, which has a property value of -1.06.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of the phosphorothioate and imide groups suggests a more negative property value. The presence of chlorine might slightly offset this negativity, but not significantly.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be approximately -1.1.

SMILES: CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -2.28
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Functional Groups and Structural Features:**
   - The molecule contains an amide group (N(C)C(=O)N), which is present in several examples with negative property values.
   - It has a chloro-substituted aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-1.09) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (0.38).
   - The molecule also contains a nitro group (n2nc(oc2=O)), which is often associated with more negative property values, as seen in O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-1.98).
   - The presence of a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C) can influence the property, but its effect is less clear from the examples.

2. **Comparison with Examples:**
   - The combination of an amide group and a chloro-substituted aromatic ring suggests a negative property value.
   - The additional presence of a nitro group further suggests a more negative value, as nitro groups tend to lower the property value significantly.
   - The tert-butyl group might slightly offset the negativity, but not enough to make the property positive.

Based on these considerations, the predicted property value for CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C is likely to be around -1.5.

True Property: -1.0899999999999994
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with chlorine atoms attached to each ring. This structure is similar to other aromatic compounds with halogen substituents in the examples.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with chlorine substituents, such as Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl (-0.4) and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 (-0.98), tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of additional chlorine atoms generally increases the property value slightly, as seen in Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (0.18).

Considering these observations, the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has three chlorine atoms and an ether linkage, which might slightly increase the property value compared to similar structures with fewer chlorine atoms.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be around -0.5.
==================================================
Iteration: 42
SMILES: CC/C=C\C
True Property: -0.26
Predicted Property:
The molecule CC/C=C\C is a linear alkene with four carbon atoms, also known as 2-butene. In the examples provided, the property values seem to be related to the hydrophobicity or lipophilicity of the molecules, which is often expressed as the log P (partition coefficient) value. 

For small alkenes like 2-butene, the log P value is typically slightly positive, indicating moderate hydrophobicity. In the examples, the molecule CC/C=C/C (which is 2-pentene) has a property value of -0.26. Since 2-butene is slightly smaller and less hydrophobic than 2-pentene, its property value would likely be slightly lower than -0.26.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC/C=C\C (2-butene) would be around -0.30.

Iteration: 43
SMILES: CCCOCC

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOCC, we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the molecular structures and their associated property values.

The molecule CCCOCC is a simple linear ether, specifically diethyl ether. In the examples provided, simple linear alkanes and ethers tend to have property values around 0.0 to -0.1. For instance, CCC(O)CC has a property value of -0.04, and C1CCCCCC1 (cyclohexane) has a property value of 0.0.

Given the structure of CCCOCC, which is relatively simple and similar to other small ethers or alkanes, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be close to those of similar molecules.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOCC is approximately -0.04.

True Property: -2.289999999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

This molecule contains:
- A tertiary amide group (N(C=O)N).
- Two phenyl rings (c1ccccc1 and c2ccccc2).
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)) attached to one of the phenyl rings.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with phenyl rings and amide groups tend to have more negative property values, often below -1.0.
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (NO2) or halogens (Cl, Br) tends to make the property value more negative.
- The presence of alkyl groups like tert-butyl can slightly increase the property value, but not significantly.

Given these observations, the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is expected to have a property value similar to other molecules with amide groups and phenyl rings, but without strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -1.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-), which is a polar functional group.
- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1), which is a benzene ring with a bromine substituent.

From the examples:
- Molecules with acetamide or similar polar groups tend to have negative property values, indicating a tendency towards certain polar characteristics.
- Molecules with bromobenzene or similar halogenated aromatic rings also tend to have negative property values, but the presence of halogens can sometimes increase the value slightly compared to non-halogenated analogs.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value, influenced by the polar acetamide group and the bromine substituent on the aromatic ring. Comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around -1.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is isobutylbenzene, which consists of an isobutyl group (CC(C)C) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1).

Looking at the examples, we have:
- Cc1ccccc1N, with a property value of -0.98
- C=Cc1ccccc1, with a property value of -1.04
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1, with a property value of -0.78
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1, with a property value of -0.78

The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is similar to CCc1ccc(C)cc1 and CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1, both of which have a property value of -0.78. The presence of the isobutyl group instead of a simple alkyl group might slightly affect the property, but given the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be close to -0.78.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is approximately -0.78.

Iteration: 47
SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -1.11
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro groups) tend to have more negative property values.
- Simple aromatic compounds without strong electron-withdrawing groups tend to have less negative or slightly positive values.

Benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, but not as strong as nitro groups. Comparing it to similar structures:
- NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (an amide and phenol) has a property value of -1.51.
- COc1ccccc1 (anisole, with a methoxy group) has a property value of -0.98.

Given that the aldehyde group is less electron-withdrawing than a nitro group but more than a methoxy group, we can predict that the property value for benzaldehyde will be between -0.98 and -1.51. A reasonable estimate would be around -1.10.

True Property: -2.71
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with negative property values.
- An aromatic ring with a heteroatom (oxygen), similar to some examples with negative values.
- A cyclic imide structure (a lactam), which is also present in some examples with negative values.

Based on these structural features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value. The presence of the nitro group and the aromatic ring with a heteroatom suggests a more negative value.

Considering the examples with similar features, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -1.8.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -1.9599999999999995
Predicted Property:
The molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is similar in structure to the example molecule N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -1.96. Both molecules contain two phenyl rings connected through a nitrogen-containing linkage. The example molecule has a diazo group (N=N), while the target molecule has an amine group (N-N). The amine linkage is generally less electron-withdrawing than the diazo linkage, which could result in a slightly less negative property value.

Considering these structural similarities and differences, I would predict the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 to be slightly less negative than -1.96. A reasonable estimate would be around -1.80.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a cyclic compound with two amide groups, similar to a diketopiperazine structure. 

Looking at the examples, cyclic compounds with amide groups, such as O=C1N(COC(=O)CC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3, have a property value of -3.15. However, this example has additional aromatic rings, which can significantly affect the property value. 

Another example, O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, has a property value of -1.39. This compound is more similar to the target molecule in terms of having a cyclic structure with amide groups and no additional aromatic rings.

Considering the structural similarities and the absence of additional aromatic or highly electronegative groups, the property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be closer to -1.39. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have property values around -0.2 to -0.11, as seen with Clc1ccccc1Cl (-0.2) and Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (-0.11).
2. The presence of additional chlorine atoms generally increases the property value slightly, as seen with ClC(Br)Br (1.25) and ClC(Cl)(Cl)C#N (0.36).

Given that Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a more complex structure with three chlorine atoms, we can expect the property value to be slightly higher than that of simpler chlorinated benzenes but still within the range of similar aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around -0.15.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.78
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Simple alkyl chains and aromatic rings tend to have property values closer to zero.
- The presence of electronegative atoms or functional groups like nitro, carbonyl, or halogens tends to decrease the property value (make it more negative).
- Molecules with more complex or polar functional groups tend to have more negative property values.

The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is relatively non-polar and lacks strongly electronegative atoms or polar functional groups. It is similar to the example Cc1ccccc1N (aniline), which has a property value of -0.98, but without the polar amine group. It is also similar to CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 (octylbenzene), which has a property value of -0.78, but with a shorter alkyl chain.

Given these considerations, the property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is likely to be slightly negative but closer to zero than the examples with polar groups. A reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be around -0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O contains a nitro group (S(N)(=O)=O) attached to a benzene ring, similar to the nitrobenzene derivatives in the examples. Nitro groups are known to be electron-withdrawing, which generally contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in the examples with nitro groups.

For instance, the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -1.58. The presence of the sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) in the target molecule is somewhat similar in electronic effect to the nitro group, as both are strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Considering these factors and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is likely to be in the same range as other aromatic compounds with strong electron-withdrawing groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -1.50.

SMILES: c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34
True Property: -2.079999999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically triphenylene. It consists of four fused benzene rings, forming a planar, aromatic structure. In the examples, similar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 and c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54, have property values of -2.34 and -2.6, respectively.

Based on this pattern, the property value for triphenylene (c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34) is likely to be in a similar range. Therefore, I predict the property value for this molecule to be approximately -2.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the more complex aromatic structures in the examples, particularly those with multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings, which tend to have more negative property values.

For instance, the molecule OC(CC(c1ccccc1)c3c(O)c2ccccc2oc3=O)c4ccc(cc4)c5ccc(Br)cc5 has a property value of -3.67, and it contains multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups, similar to the target molecule. Another example is Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4, which has a property value of -3.27, and also features multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups.

Given these comparisons, the target molecule is likely to have a significantly negative property value due to its structural complexity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, which can contribute to a lower property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 would be approximately -3.00.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphoric acid ester group (P=O with OC and NC).
- A thioester linkage (SC).
- An acetyl group (C=O with a methyl group).

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with phosphoric acid ester groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (0.46) and COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (0.07), tend to have positive or slightly positive property values.
- The presence of sulfur, as in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, also contributes to a positive property value.
- The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) in various contexts often results in negative property values, but the effect can be moderated by other groups.

Considering these factors, the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC has a combination of features that suggest a slightly positive property value, influenced by the phosphoric acid ester and thioester groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around 0.10.

Predicted Property:
The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, relatively non-polar molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. Based on the examples provided, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly chlorine, tend to have property values around 0.18 (as seen with Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl) or slightly negative values when combined with other functional groups.

Given the simplicity and the presence of two chlorine atoms, I would predict the property value for Cl\C=C/Cl to be slightly positive, similar to other small halogenated hydrocarbons. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be approximately 0.18.

To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1 (pyridine), we can analyze the given examples and their properties. The examples suggest that aromatic compounds with nitrogen atoms tend to have more negative property values. For instance, the molecule c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 has a property value of -1.96, and other nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds also have negative values.

Pyridine is a simple aromatic heterocycle with one nitrogen atom, similar to benzene but with one carbon replaced by nitrogen. Given the trend in the examples, pyridine is likely to have a negative property value, but not as negative as more complex or highly substituted nitrogen-containing aromatics.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of pyridine (c1ccncc1) would be around -1.00.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23

This molecule contains several key features:

1. **Aromatic rings**: The presence of aromatic rings is common in many of the examples with negative property values.
2. **Amide linkage**: The presence of an amide group (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23) is similar to some examples with negative values.
3. **Chlorine substitution**: The presence of a chlorine atom, which can influence the property value, is seen in examples with both positive and negative values, but often contributes to a negative value when combined with aromatic systems.
4. **Ether and ester groups**: The presence of ether (OCC(O)CO) and ester (OC(=O)c1ccccc1) groups, which are also seen in examples with negative values.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value. The presence of multiple aromatic rings, an amide linkage, and a chlorine atom suggests a more negative value, similar to other complex aromatic systems with functional groups.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately -2.0.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly indicating a measure of hydrophobicity or solubility. Linear alkanes and simple alcohols tend to have property values around zero or slightly negative, reflecting their moderate hydrophobicity and solubility characteristics.

The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol (1-pentanol), which is similar in structure to other simple alcohols and alkanes. Given the examples, such as OC1CCCCCCC1 (cycloheptanol) with a property value of -0.04, and considering the linear nature of CCCCCO, I would predict a slightly negative property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCO is approximately -0.2.

- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is known to be electron-withdrawing.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is also electron-withdrawing.
- An aromatic ring (phenyl group), which can contribute to electron delocalization.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which is relatively neutral but can slightly increase polarity.

From the examples, molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (N(=O)=O) and sulfonyl (S(=O)(=O)) tend to have more negative property values. For instance, the molecule with a nitro group and a sulfonyl group (CCOP(=S)(OCC)Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O) has a property value of -1.01. The presence of an aromatic ring and an amide group in the given molecule suggests a similar trend towards a negative value.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:

1. **Aromatic Ring with Nitro Group**: The presence of a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring is a significant feature. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups on aromatic rings tend to have more negative property values, such as -2.39 for CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O and -1.38 for Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O.

2. **Ester Groups**: The molecule has ester groups (COC(=O)) which are also present in some of the examples. Esters can contribute to a slightly negative property value, as seen in CCCCCC(=O)OC with a value of -0.53.

3. **Heterocyclic Ring**: The presence of a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen (NC) can also influence the property value. In the examples, heterocyclic structures with nitrogen, such as CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O, have more negative values like -1.97.

4. **Overall Complexity and Substitution**: The molecule is relatively complex with multiple functional groups and substitutions, which generally leads to more negative property values.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is moderately negative. Given the influence of the nitro group, ester groups, and the overall complexity, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -1.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It contains two amide groups and a cyclohexane-like structure due to the cyclization of the peptide bond. This structure is relatively small and compact, with polar amide groups that can engage in hydrogen bonding.

Looking at the examples, molecules with polar functional groups like amides, carbonyls, and cyclic structures tend to have negative property values. For instance, molecules with amide groups and cyclic structures such as OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O (-2.17) and CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (-1.22) have negative values.

Considering the structural features and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be negative. Given the compact and polar nature of the molecule, a reasonable prediction would be around -1.0. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule is approximately -1.0.

SMILES: ClCC
True Property: 0.29
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule ClCC is a simple chloroalkane, specifically chloroethane. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons like CCCCC and CCC1CCCCC1 have a property value of 0.0, while aromatic chlorinated compounds like Clc1ccccc1 have a property value of -0.49. However, ClCC is not aromatic and is a small, simple molecule.

Considering the examples, the presence of a chlorine atom in a non-aromatic, small molecule like ClCC might slightly decrease the property value from 0.0, but not as significantly as in aromatic systems. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be slightly negative, but close to zero.

Based on this analysis, the predicted property value for ClCC is approximately -0.20.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl contains:
- A chlorinated aromatic ring with a nitrogen atom (pyridine ring).
- A trichloromethyl group attached to the pyridine ring.

From the examples, we can observe:
- Chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have negative property values, as seen in Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2 (-1.27) and Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (-0.69).
- The presence of multiple chlorine atoms, especially in a trichloromethyl group, can increase the property value, as seen in ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O (0.39) and BrC(Cl)Cl (1.06).

Considering these factors, the presence of the pyridine ring might slightly lower the property value compared to a benzene ring, but the trichloromethyl group is likely to increase it. Balancing these effects, the predicted property value for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is likely to be slightly negative or close to zero.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is approximately -0.1.

Iteration: 66
SMILES: CCCCC(C)O
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCC(C)O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a primary alcohol with a five-carbon chain and a hydroxyl group, similar to the structure of CCC(CC)CO, which has a property value of -0.04. The presence of the hydroxyl group generally contributes to a slightly negative property value due to its polar nature, which can increase solubility in polar solvents and affect other properties.

Given the similarity in structure to CCC(CC)CO, and considering the additional carbon in CCCCC(C)O, which might slightly increase the hydrophobic character, the property value is likely to be close to -0.04. However, the effect of the additional carbon is relatively minor compared to the influence of the hydroxyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCC(C)O would be approximately -0.04.

SMILES: Brc1ccc(Br)cc1
True Property: 0.17999999999999994
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property in question seems to be related to the electronic or steric effects of the substituents on the aromatic ring, possibly a measure of hydrophobicity or electronic influence.

The molecule Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is 1,4-dibromobenzene, which is an aromatic compound with two bromine atoms para to each other on a benzene ring. In the examples provided, halogenated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values, indicating a certain electronic or steric effect.

For instance:
- ClCCl (1,2-dichloroethene) has a property value of 0.58.
- ClC(Cl)Cl (chloroform) has a property value of 0.87.
- ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl (carbon tetrachloride) has a property value of 1.16.
- CI (iodomethane) has a property value of 0.73.

Given that bromine is more polarizable than chlorine but less so than iodine, and considering the para substitution pattern which might reduce steric hindrance compared to ortho substitution, we can predict that the property value for 1,4-dibromobenzene would be positive and likely between the values for dichloroethene and iodomethane.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately 0.73.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of halogen atoms (such as Cl and Br) and the overall structure of the molecule, particularly the degree of aromaticity and substitution pattern.

The molecule in question is a chlorinated biphenyl, which is similar in structure to the example Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 1.34. The given molecule has a similar structure but with fewer chlorine atoms.

Considering the structural similarity and the number of chlorine atoms, the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl is likely to be slightly lower than 1.34 due to the reduced number of chlorine atoms, which generally contribute to increasing the property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately 1.30.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- Aromatic rings (phenyl groups), which are common in several examples with negative property values.
- Phosphate ester linkage (P(=O)(O)O), which is not directly present in the examples but can be considered similar to other polar functional groups like carbonyls and nitro groups, which tend to contribute to negative property values.
- Alkyl groups (methyl groups), which are present in many examples and often contribute to less negative or neutral property values.

Considering these features, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of aromatic rings and the polar phosphate group. The presence of alkyl groups might slightly offset the negativity but not significantly.

Based on the examples, molecules with similar complexity and polar functional groups tend to have property values in the range of -1.0 to -2.0. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -1.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to be electron-withdrawing.
- An aromatic ring, which is common in many of the examples.
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle, specifically a piperidine ring with a ketone group (C=O) and two chlorine atoms attached.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (NO2) or multiple halogens (Cl, Br) tend to have more negative property values.
- Aromatic rings with electron-withdrawing groups also tend to have negative values.
- The presence of a ketone group (C=O) in a ring structure, as seen in some examples, also contributes to a more negative value.

Considering these factors, the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O has several electron-withdrawing groups (CF3, Cl) and a ketone, which suggests a negative property value. Comparing it to similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -1.5.

SMILES: COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.58
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitroanisole, which consists of a methoxy group (CO) attached to a benzene ring, with a nitro group (N(=O)=O) also attached to the ring.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with nitro groups tend to have negative property values, indicating a certain electronic or steric effect that contributes to this trend. For instance, O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -1.98.
- Methoxy groups (as seen in some aromatic compounds) can also contribute to negative property values, though the effect might be less pronounced than nitro groups.

Considering these observations, the presence of both a methoxy group and a nitro group on the benzene ring suggests a significant negative property value. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which typically has a more substantial impact than the methoxy group.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around -1.5.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, which is similar in nature to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 1.74. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in the examples with high chlorine content.

Given the high degree of chlorination and the structural similarity to the example with a property value of 1.74, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl will also be relatively high.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is approximately 1.74.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. Esters generally have moderate to low polarity and are often less polar than carboxylic acids or amides.

Looking at the examples, we can see that molecules with similar functional groups and carbon chain lengths tend to have property values around -0.5 to -1.0. For instance, CC(O)c1ccccc1 (a secondary alcohol with an aromatic ring) has a property value of -0.82, and CCC#C (a small alkyne) has a property value of -0.44.

Given that CCCOC=O is a small ester, it is likely to have a property value in a similar range. Considering the examples and the nature of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be around -0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically a fatty acid ester, with a long alkyl chain (10 carbons) and an ethyl group attached to the ester functional group.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with long alkyl chains, such as CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 (-0.78) and CCCCC(CC)C=O (-0.33), tend to have property values around -0.3 to -0.8.
- Esters, such as CCCOC (-0.04), tend to have property values closer to zero, but this is a much smaller ester compared to the one in question.

Considering the structure of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, it is a larger molecule with a long hydrophobic alkyl chain, which might slightly decrease the property value compared to smaller esters. However, the ester functional group itself tends to bring the value closer to zero.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around -0.2.

- Two chlorine atoms, which can increase the property value, but in the context of aromatic systems, they often contribute to a negative value.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value. The presence of the nitro group and the amide linkage suggests a more negative value, while the chlorine atoms might slightly offset this negativity.

Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be approximately -1.5.

The presence of multiple aromatic rings and phosphorothioate groups suggests a property value that is likely negative, as seen in many of the examples with similar features. The molecule's complexity and the presence of electron-withdrawing groups (such as the phosphorothioate groups) further support a negative value.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 would be approximately -1.5.

From the examples, we can see that molecules with nitro groups attached to aromatic rings tend to have more negative property values. For instance, Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -1.38, and Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 has a property value of -1.78. The presence of the nitro group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, generally increases the negative value of the property.

Considering the structure of 4-nitrophenol and its similarity to the example Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can predict that the property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O will be in a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is approximately -1.38.

SMILES: OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O
True Property: -0.64
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a sugar-like structure with multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups and ether linkages, which is indicative of a polysaccharide or complex carbohydrate.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as sugars, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, which is a sugar-like structure, has a property value of -0.2. The presence of multiple hydroxyl groups generally increases the polarity and hydrogen bonding capability of the molecule, which tends to lower the property value.

Given the complexity and the number of hydroxyl groups in the molecule OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be more negative than simpler sugar structures due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.5.

Iteration: 79
SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -0.44
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne, which contains a terminal alkyne group.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with simple linear or branched alkane or alkene structures, such as CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO (-0.04) and CCCCCCCCCC=C (-0.26), tend to have property values around -0.04 to -0.26.
- The presence of a triple bond (alkyne) might slightly affect the property, but given the simplicity and small size of the molecule, it is likely to be similar to small alkanes or alkenes.

Considering these points, the predicted property value for CCC#C (1-butyne) is likely to be slightly more negative than simple alkanes but not as negative as more complex or aromatic structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around -0.20.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 0.4999999999999999
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -0.1.
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents, similar to Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl, which has a property value of 0.09, and Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of -0.69.

Considering these structural similarities, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, while the phosphorothioate group tends to decrease it slightly. Balancing these effects, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl would likely be slightly negative, but close to zero.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately -0.1.

Iteration: 81
SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -1.42
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 contains a pyridine ring (a six-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen atom) and a hydrazide group (C(=O)NN). In the examples, molecules with nitrogen-containing aromatic rings, such as pyridine or pyrimidine, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 has a property value of -1.96, and Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2 has a property value of -1.85.

Additionally, the presence of the hydrazide group (C(=O)NN) could further contribute to a negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is likely to be negative. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -1.5.

True Property: 0.38999999999999985
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, which has a property value of -1.01.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is present in several molecules with negative property values, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C (-0.73) and CCN2c1cc(N(C)C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23 (-2.56).
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1), which is a saturated heterocyclic structure that can contribute to a less negative or slightly positive property value, but in this context, it is part of a larger structure with other electronegative groups.

Considering these features and the overall structure, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of the phosphorothioate and amide groups, which are associated with negative values in the examples. However, the presence of alkyl chains and the piperidine ring may moderate the negativity.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around -1.2.

Iteration: 83
SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a property like hydrophobicity or solubility. Linear alkanes, such as the ones in the examples, tend to have property values around 0 or slightly negative, indicating a neutral or slightly hydrophobic nature.

The molecule CCCCCCCC is a linear alkane (octane). Looking at similar structures in the examples, such as CCCCCCCO (which has a property value of -0.04), it is reasonable to predict that CCCCCCCC would have a property value close to 0, as it is a simple hydrocarbon without polar functional groups.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCC is 0.0.

Iteration: 84
SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: -1.11
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbon-carbon triple bond (C#C). The presence of multiple rings and a hydroxyl group suggests some degree of hydrophobicity and potential for hydrogen bonding, respectively. The carbon-carbon triple bond can also influence the overall electronic properties of the molecule.

Looking at the examples, polycyclic compounds with ketone groups (C=O) and hydroxyl groups tend to have negative property values, indicating a certain degree of hydrophilicity or electronic effects that lower the property value. For instance, the molecule CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O has a property value of -0.63, and CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO has a property value of -1.37.

Considering these factors, the presence of the hydroxyl group, the ketone, and the alkyne, the property value for the given molecule is likely to be negative. Given the structural complexity and the presence of functional groups that typically lower the property value, a reasonable prediction would be around -1.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is approximately -1.0.

True Property: -3.3299999999999996
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups. The presence of these functional groups and the overall complexity of the structure suggest that it might have a relatively low property value, similar to other complex polycyclic and aromatic structures in the examples.

Based on the examples provided, particularly those with complex polycyclic structures and multiple functional groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -2.5. This is consistent with the trend observed in the examples, where increased complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups tend to correlate with lower property values.

Iteration: 86
SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: -0.6900000000000002
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a chlorine substituent. In the examples, we have:

- Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (a nitrophenol) with a property value of -1.58.
- Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) with a property value of -0.85.
- Clc1ccccc1I (iodobenzene) with a property value of 0.24.
- Clc1cccc2ccccc12 (dichlorobiphenyl) with a property value of -1.01.

The presence of the hydroxyl group in phenol generally contributes to a more negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature and potential for hydrogen bonding. The chlorine substituent, as seen in chlorobenzene derivatives, tends to have a less negative or slightly positive influence compared to more electronegative substituents like nitro groups.

Considering these factors, the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is likely to be more negative than chlorobenzene derivatives but less negative than nitrophenol. A reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around -0.90.

SMILES: ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1
True Property: -1.3699999999999997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C), which is relatively polar and can contribute to a more negative property value.
- An ester linkage (OC(=O)), which is also polar and typically contributes to a more negative property value.
- An amide group (NC(=O)), which is polar and contributes to a more negative property value.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1), which is similar to some of the examples provided, such as Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (0.47) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (0.18).

Considering these structural features and comparing them to the examples, the presence of multiple polar groups (ester, amide, and chloroalkyne) suggests a more negative property value. The chlorinated aromatic ring, while contributing to some positive values in other examples, is balanced by the other polar groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around -1.5.

SMILES: OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl
True Property: -1.9399999999999995
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2).
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with phenyl rings and halogen substituents (e.g., Clc1cccc(Cl)c1, Clc1ccc(Br)cc1) tend to have property values around -0.01 to -0.2.
- Molecules with heterocyclic rings like pyrimidine (e.g., Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2) have property values around -1.78.
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings and halogens tends to lower the property value, as seen in examples like Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc2Cl (0.18) and ClC(Cl)=C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 (-0.66).

Considering these observations, the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl has features that suggest a property value in the negative range, likely influenced by the aromatic and halogen components.

Based on the structural analysis and comparison with similar molecules, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl would be approximately -1.5.
==================================================
Iteration: 89
SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: -0.53
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCCCOC=O is an ester, specifically a linear ester with a five-carbon alkyl chain and a carbonyl group. 

Looking at the examples, we have:
- CCCC(=O)OCC, which is a similar ester with a four-carbon alkyl chain and a property value of -0.53.
- CCCCCCC=O, which is a ketone with a six-carbon chain and a property value of -0.33.

The molecule CCCCCOC=O is structurally similar to CCCC(=O)OCC, but with one additional carbon in the alkyl chain. The presence of the ester functional group and the length of the carbon chain are important factors in determining the property value. 

Given the trend that longer carbon chains tend to have slightly less negative property values, and considering the structural similarity to CCCC(=O)OCC, I would predict the property value for CCCCCOC=O to be slightly less negative than -0.53. 

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O would be approximately -0.50.

Iteration: 90
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.58
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, the property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly indicating a measure of hydrophobicity or solubility. The molecule "ClCCl" is similar in structure to "ClCCCl," which has a property value of 0.58. The difference between the two is the absence of one carbon atom in "ClCCl," which might slightly affect the property value.

Given this, I would predict that the property value for "ClCCl" would be slightly lower than 0.58 due to the reduced size and potential decrease in hydrophobic character. A reasonable prediction for the property value of "ClCCl" would be approximately 0.50.
==================================================
Iteration: 91
SMILES: Cc1cccc(C)c1O
True Property: -0.98
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methylphenol, specifically a cresol, which is a benzene ring with two methyl groups and a hydroxyl group.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with phenolic (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) structures, such as Oc1cccc(O)c1, have property values around -1.18.
- Alkyl-substituted benzene rings, such as CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, have property values around -0.98.

Considering the structure of Cc1cccc(C)c1O, which is similar to a combination of these features, we can predict that the property value will be in a similar range. Given the presence of the hydroxyl group and the methyl groups, the property value is likely to be slightly less negative than -1.18 but more negative than -0.98.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O is approximately -1.00.

Iteration: 92
SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: -0.4000000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to similar molecules in the provided examples. This molecule is a dichlorinated biphenyl, which is similar to the example Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 0.18.

The given molecule has four chlorine atoms, two on each phenyl ring, which is similar to the example with five chlorine atoms. The presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the property value due to their electron-withdrawing nature, but the effect is not linear with the number of chlorine atoms. The example with five chlorines has a positive property value, suggesting that the presence of multiple chlorines contributes to a positive value.

Considering the structural similarity and the number of chlorine atoms, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is likely to be slightly lower than 0.18 due to having one less chlorine atom. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately:

0.10

Iteration: 93
SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: -0.26
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple hydrocarbon with a branched structure and a double bond. 

Looking at the examples, simple hydrocarbons like CCCCCCCC (octane) have a property value of 0.0, and CCCCCCCCCC=C (nonene) has a value of -0.26. The presence of a double bond in nonene slightly decreases the property value compared to octane. Isoprene, being a smaller molecule with a similar feature (a double bond), is expected to have a property value close to these examples.

Considering the size and structure of isoprene, I would predict its property value to be slightly negative, similar to nonene but possibly a bit more negative due to its smaller size and branched structure. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around -0.2.
==================================================
Iteration: 94
SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.58
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular size and complexity. The molecule ClCCl is 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, which is a small, simple molecule with multiple chlorine atoms.

In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl and ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl), have positive property values (0.9 and 2.06, respectively). This suggests that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms tends to increase the property value.

Given that ClCCl is a small molecule with two chlorine atoms, I would predict a positive property value, but likely smaller than those of the more complex chlorinated compounds in the examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around 0.5.
==================================================
Iteration: 95
SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.1100000000000001
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have property values around -0.11 to 0.66. For instance, Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of -0.11, and Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1 has a property value of 0.66.

2. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen with Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1.

3. The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) in aromatic compounds, such as phenols, tends to lower the property value, as seen in CC(O)c1ccccc1 with a value of -0.82.

Considering these points, the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl has three chlorine atoms and one hydroxyl group. The presence of the hydroxyl group will likely lower the property value compared to a fully chlorinated benzene ring, but the three chlorine atoms will still contribute to a relatively higher value compared to non-halogenated phenols.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl would be slightly higher than -0.11, but not as high as 0.66. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.0.

True Property: -3.3299999999999996
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by factors such as the presence of functional groups, aromaticity, and molecular complexity.

The given molecule, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, appears to be a complex structure with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and oxygen-containing functional groups. These features are similar to those in molecules with highly negative property values in the examples.

Considering the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing groups, which often contribute to more negative property values, I would predict a property value in the range of the more negative examples. Based on the patterns observed, a reasonable prediction for this molecule's property value would be approximately -2.5.

Iteration: 97
SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -1.04
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A thioether group (CS-)
- A pyrazole ring (1,2,4-triazole-like structure)
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- A tertiary butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (NO2) or multiple halogens tends to decrease the property value further.
- Simple aliphatic chains or small polar groups like alcohols or ethers tend to have property values closer to zero or slightly negative.

The molecule in question has a heterocyclic ring with a carbonyl group and a bulky tertiary butyl group, which might contribute to a moderately negative property value. Comparing it to similar structures in the examples, such as CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C (-1.21), which also has a heterocyclic ring and a tertiary butyl group, we can infer that the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be approximately -1.20.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -1.31
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, the property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly indicating a type of chemical property such as solubility, partition coefficient, or electronic property. The molecule in question, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, is ethyl benzoate, an ester with a benzene ring.

Looking at similar structures in the examples:
- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 has a property value of -2.76. This molecule is more complex due to additional functional groups.
- CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, which is a diketone with a benzene ring, has a property value of -1.7.
- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, a nitrobenzene derivative, has a property value of -1.38.

Ethyl benzoate is simpler than these examples, lacking additional electron-withdrawing groups or complex ring systems. It is more similar to simpler aromatic compounds with fewer functional groups.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around -1.38, similar to other simple aromatic esters or ketones.
==================================================
Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.48
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and shape of the molecule.

In the examples, we see that:
- Simple alkanes and alcohols like CCCCCCCCO have property values close to zero, such as -0.04 for CCCCCCCCO.
- The presence of a halogen, such as Cl or Br, tends to slightly increase the property value, as seen with CI having a value of 0.73 and Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 having a value of -0.82.

Given that CCCCCCCBr is a simple alkane chain with a bromine atom, it is similar to CCCCCCCCO but with a bromine instead of an alcohol group. The presence of the bromine is likely to increase the property value slightly compared to the alcohol.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be slightly above zero, similar to the trend seen with other halogenated compounds. A predicted value could be around 0.1.
==================================================
Iteration: 100
SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.04
Predicted Property:
The property values provided in the examples appear to be related to the hydrophobicity or lipophilicity of the molecules, often expressed as the logarithm of the partition coefficient (log P) between octanol and water. 

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a small, simple molecule with no hydrophobic groups or significant polarizability. It is a gas at room temperature and is not expected to have significant solubility in octanol compared to water. Therefore, its log P value would likely be close to zero or slightly negative, indicating a preference for the aqueous phase.

Based on the examples and the nature of CO, I would predict the property value (log P) for CO to be approximately 0.0.
