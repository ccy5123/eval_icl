- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) attached to the aromatic ring, which can also contribute to a negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
- An alkene group (C=C) in the side chain, which is less common in the examples but can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have negative property values.
- Molecules with trifluoromethyl groups, such as CN(C)C(=O)Nc1cccc(OC(=O)NC(C)(C)C)c1, have positive property values, but this is in a different context.
- The presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro and trifluoromethyl) tends to lower the property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value. Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O would be around -0.5 to -1.0. However, given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the groups, a more specific prediction would be:

-0.75

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: -0.7787196903301661
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. 

From the examples, we can observe that simple esters and similar small molecules tend to have negative property values. For instance, CC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of -0.77871969, and CCCC=O has a property value of -0.25302082. These examples suggest that the property value for small esters and carbonyl-containing compounds is generally negative.

Given the structure of CC(C)OC=O, which is a small ester, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be negative and likely similar to the other small esters and carbonyl compounds in the examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be approximately -0.77871969, similar to other small esters in the list.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -3.1873338018286446
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Simple aromatic compounds with hydroxyl groups, such as phenols, tend to have negative property values. For instance, c1ccccc1O has a property value of -3.1873338.
- The presence of additional methyl groups on the aromatic ring, as seen in Cc1cccc(C)c1, also results in a negative property value of -3.1873338.

Given these observations, the presence of both a hydroxyl group and methyl groups on the aromatic ring in Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 suggests that the property value will likely be negative and similar to those of other phenolic compounds with methyl groups.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is approximately -3.1873338.

True Property: 0.22583239623820267
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)O), which is similar to the phosphorothioate groups in the examples COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl. These examples have property values of 0.99116953, 1.17910961, and 0.82711718, respectively.

The molecule also contains a substituted aromatic ring with a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C). The presence of these groups can influence the property value, but the overall structure is still dominated by the phosphorothioate group.

Considering the similarity in the phosphorothioate group and the substitution pattern on the aromatic ring, the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be in a similar range to the examples with phosphorothioate groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is approximately 0.9.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we can observe that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values. For instance:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.53874764.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.83629949.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is similar to these examples, with multiple chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings. Based on the trend observed, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for this molecule will also be positive and likely within the range of the examples provided.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately 0.7.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -1.0297375973372056
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group attached to the terminal carbon. This structure is somewhat similar to the example CCC, which has a property value of 0.31156365, but with the addition of a nitro group, which is an electron-withdrawing group.

In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, tend to have higher property values, often positive, due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group. However, the complexity and number of nitro groups also play a role.

Considering the simplicity of CCCN(=O)=O compared to the more complex nitro-containing examples, the property value is likely to be positive but not as high as those with multiple nitro groups or aromatic systems.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be slightly higher than that of CCC, but not as high as the more complex nitro compounds. A predicted value could be around 0.4 to 0.5.

Predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O: 0.45

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.342204334442094
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, which can be compared to similar structures in the examples.

From the examples, we have:
- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 with a property value of 0.29767016
- COc1cccc(Cl)c1 with a property value of -1.44838949
- Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl with a property value of -0.41344854
- c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12 with a property value of -2.50083249

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but with a fluorine atom instead of a chlorine atom. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which could influence the property value. The presence of both fluorine and bromine in the aromatic ring suggests that the property value might be slightly different from the example with chlorine and bromine.

Considering the electronegativity and the examples provided, the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is likely to be close to that of Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but potentially slightly lower due to the increased electronegativity of fluorine compared to chlorine.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be approximately 0.2.

True Property: 0.2550558553783619
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with an additional hydroxyl group. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with cyclic and bicyclic frameworks.

Looking at the examples, we notice that molecules with similar cyclic structures and alcohol groups, such as CC1CCCO1 (0.25505586) and CCC(C)(C)O (0.25505586), have property values around 0.255. These examples suggest that the presence of a cyclic structure with an alcohol group tends to result in a property value around this range.

Therefore, based on the structural similarity and the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is approximately 0.25505586.

True Property: -2.0073908651204455
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), an amide linkage, and a phenyl ring. It is similar to the example molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of -0.48891855. The main difference is the substitution of the thioether (SC(CCl)) with an amide linkage (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O).

The presence of the amide group, which is polar and can engage in hydrogen bonding, might slightly alter the property value compared to the thioether group. However, given the structural similarities and the presence of the phosphorothioate group, the property value is likely to be in a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be approximately -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzene ring with a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule Cc1ccccc1n3c(C)nc2ccccc2c3=O, which has a property value of 0.93134882. Both molecules contain aromatic rings and nitrogen heterocycles, but the example molecule is more complex with additional aromatic rings and a different substitution pattern.

Considering the structural similarities and the complexity of the molecule, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would likely be in a similar range but slightly lower due to its simpler structure. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.8.

True Property: -0.7787196903301661
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which is a linear chain with a total of 9 carbon atoms.

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCCCC, a linear alkane with 5 carbons, has a property value of 0.31156365.
- CCCCCCCCI, a linear alkane with 8 carbons and an iodine atom, has a property value of 1.05438158.
- CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, a linear ester with 9 carbons, has a property value of -0.77871969.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar to CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, but with one less carbon in the chain. Given the trend in the examples, the presence of the ester functional group tends to lower the property value compared to simple alkanes. The property value for CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is -0.77871969, and since CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is slightly smaller, we might expect a similar or slightly less negative value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around -0.77871969, possibly slightly less negative due to the shorter chain length. A specific prediction could be approximately -0.75.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is methyl benzoate, which is an ester with a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Esters like CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 have a property value of -0.25762624.
2. Aromatic compounds with ester groups, such as CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, have a property value of -0.78568687.

Given that COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is similar to the second example, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, but without the additional carbon chain, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be close to -0.78568687.

Therefore, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.78568687.

SMILES: C=CCC=C
True Property: -0.7465839552885122
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the overall molecular structure.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear hydrocarbon with two double bonds, also known as 1,3-butadiene. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons and those with unsaturation (double or triple bonds) tend to have property values around zero or slightly negative. For instance, the molecule CC/C=C/C has a property value of -0.11057022, and CCC(=O)C has a value of -0.25302082.

Given the structure of C=CCC=C and its similarity to other unsaturated hydrocarbons in the examples, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be slightly negative, reflecting the unsaturation and lack of polar functional groups.

Therefore, the predicted property value for C=CCC=C is approximately -0.15.

SMILES: BrC(Br)Br
True Property: 1.5096246397977673
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular size and complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br, also known as bromoform, is a simple halogenated compound with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples provided, halogenated aromatic compounds like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 have a property value of -2.50083249, and Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1 has a value of -2.66362712. These values are negative, likely due to the electron-withdrawing nature of halogens and the aromatic stabilization.

However, BrC(Br)Br is not aromatic and is a smaller, simpler molecule compared to the aromatic examples. The presence of multiple bromine atoms, which are heavy and electronegative, might contribute to a negative property value, but the simplicity of the molecule could result in a less negative value compared to the complex aromatic systems.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around -1.5. This accounts for the electron-withdrawing effect of the bromine atoms while acknowledging the simplicity and non-aromatic nature of the molecule.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 0.16529198.
- An amide linkage (N-C=O) within a cyclic structure, similar to the example CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O, which has a property value of -2.09585153.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), similar to the example Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, which has a property value of 0.7511716.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the cyclic amide linkage might suggest a property value closer to the lower end of the spectrum, but the presence of the chlorinated carbon could increase the value slightly.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 0.1.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule contains several functional groups and structural elements that can influence its property value:

1. **Amide Group (N-C(=O)-N):** This is a common feature in several molecules with negative property values, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C (-1.69031292) and CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C (-1.63897238).

2. **Chlorine Substituent (Cl):** The presence of chlorine often contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-1.84701994) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (0.7511716).

3. **Aromatic Ring with Nitrogen (n2nc(oc2=O)):** The presence of heteroatoms in aromatic rings can influence the property value. For example, Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2 has a property value of 0.13050997.

4. **Tert-butyl Group (C(C)(C)C):** This bulky group can affect the molecule's overall property, as seen in CCC(C)C (0.31156365).

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of the amide group and chlorine substituent, which are common in molecules with negative values. However, the presence of the tert-butyl group and the aromatic nitrogen-containing ring might moderate this effect.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be around -1.5.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which has two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with chlorine atoms attached to each phenyl ring. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a property value of -0.41344854. However, the presence of an additional phenyl ring connected by an ether linkage could influence the property value.

Another relevant example is Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -3.1873338. This molecule also has two phenyl rings with chlorine substituents, but they are directly connected, not through an ether linkage.

Considering these comparisons, the ether linkage in the target molecule might slightly increase the property value compared to the directly connected biphenyl structure. However, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms, which tend to decrease the property value, suggests that the overall property value will still be negative.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be around -1.0.

Looking at the examples, we see that small aliphatic alcohols and ethers, such as CC(C)O (0.25505586) and CCC(O)CC (0.25505586), have property values around 0.255. The presence of an ether linkage (C-O-C) in CCCOCC is similar to the structure of these compounds, suggesting that the property value should be in a similar range.

Therefore, based on the pattern observed in the examples, the predicted property value for CCCOCC is approximately 0.25505586.

This molecule is a tertiary amide with two phenyl rings and a tert-butyl group. The presence of aromatic rings and the amide functional group suggests that it might have a property value similar to other aromatic amides in the examples.

Looking at the examples, the molecule CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 has a property value of 0.91425277, and it also contains aromatic rings and an amide group. Another similar structure is CCCCC1C(=O)N3N(C1=O)c2cc(C)ccc2N=C3N(C)C, which has a property value of 0.88817024.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the presence of aromatic rings and an amide group, the predicted property value for CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be in a similar range.

- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1), which is similar to the structure in Fc1cccc(Br)c1 with a property value of -0.34220433.

Considering these structural features, the presence of the acetamide group, and the bromobenzene moiety, the property value is likely to be negative. The closest example with a similar structure is Fc1cccc(Br)c1, which has a property value of -0.34220433. The acetamide group might slightly influence the property value, but it is not expected to drastically change the sign or magnitude.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be approximately -0.3.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with a benzene ring and alkyl substituents tend to have negative property values. For instance:
- C=Cc1ccccc1 has a property value of -2.29367369.
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1 has a property value of -2.07644261.
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1 has a property value of -2.07644261.

These examples suggest that the presence of a benzene ring with alkyl substituents results in a negative property value, typically around -2.0 to -2.3.

Given that CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is structurally similar to the examples above, particularly CCc1ccc(C)cc1 and CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be in a similar range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is approximately -2.07644261.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have positive property values, while those with electron-donating groups or less polar substituents tend to have negative values. For instance, the molecule NC(=O)c1ccccc1O (an amide with a phenol group) has a property value of -0.25762624, and COc1ccccc1 (anisole) has a value of -3.1873338.

Benzaldehyde has an aldehyde group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, but not as strongly as nitro groups. Therefore, we can expect the property value to be slightly negative, similar to other aromatic compounds with moderately electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 (benzaldehyde) would be around -0.2 to -0.3. Given the examples, a specific prediction could be:

The given molecule is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring, similar to some of the examples. The presence of the nitro group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, often contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in some examples like Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 (-1.12065263) and Clc1cccc(c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (0.53874764).

Additionally, the molecule contains a lactam (cyclic amide) structure, which can also influence the property value. The presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups and the heterocyclic structure suggest that the property value might be negative or slightly positive, depending on the balance of these effects.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.5.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: 0.4648197111954498
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a diarylamine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a nitrogen atom.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, especially when the rings are fused or connected in a way that increases conjugation.
- The presence of nitro groups (N(=O)=O) often results in negative property values, likely due to their electron-withdrawing nature.
- Simple hydrocarbons or those with alkyl groups tend to have positive or slightly positive property values.

The molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is similar to the example N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 0.46481971. The main difference is the substitution of the azo group (N=N) with an amine group (N-N). The amine group is less electron-withdrawing than the azo group, which might suggest a slightly higher property value due to less electron deficiency.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to be slightly higher than 0.46481971. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 0.5.

Looking at the examples, we can find a similar structure: O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, which has a property value of -0.54761995. This molecule also contains a diketopiperazine core, but with additional alkyl groups attached.

The molecule in question, O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, is a simpler diketopiperazine without the additional alkyl groups. Based on the examples, simpler structures tend to have less extreme property values. 

Considering the structural similarity and the trend in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 would be slightly less negative than -0.54761995, due to its simpler structure. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.6.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have positive property values. For instance, Clc1ccccc1Cl has a property value of 0.0, and Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a property value of 0.14969597.
- The presence of additional aromatic rings or extended conjugation tends to increase the property value, as seen in the example of Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl.

Given that Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a biphenyl with three chlorine atoms, it is likely to have a positive property value, potentially higher than the simple dichlorobenzene (Clc1ccccc1Cl) due to the additional aromatic ring.

Based on these observations, I would predict the property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl to be approximately 0.2.

- Alkyl-substituted aromatics like CCCc1ccccn1 (alkylpyridine) have a property value of -2.94903331.
- Linear alkanes like CCCCCCCCCCCCCC (hexadecane) have a property value of 0.25505586.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a diethylbenzene, it is more similar to the alkyl-substituted aromatic compounds. The property values for these types of compounds tend to be negative, as seen in the examples.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is a sulfonamide derivative, which contains a benzene ring (phenyl group) attached to a sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O). In the examples, we have several aromatic compounds with different substituents, and their property values vary based on the nature and position of these substituents.

For instance, the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which is a nitrobenzene derivative, has a property value of -0.11468719. The presence of the nitro group, which is an electron-withdrawing group, influences the property value. Similarly, the sulfonamide group in Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is also electron-withdrawing, but it is less electronegative compared to the nitro group.

Considering the structural similarity and the electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonamide group, we can predict that the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be slightly less negative than that of the nitrobenzene derivative. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be around -0.1.

- c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54, with a property value of 1.0756821

Both of these examples have positive property values, indicating that the polycyclic aromatic structure contributes positively to the property in question. The molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 is similar in structure to these examples, as it is also a polycyclic aromatic compound.

Given the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 will also be positive and within a similar range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately 1.0.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is a simple alkene with two chlorine atoms attached to the carbon-carbon double bond. This structure is similar to aromatic chlorinated compounds, which tend to have positive property values in the examples provided.

For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.53874764, and Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of -0.41344854. These examples suggest that the presence of chlorine atoms can lead to a positive or slightly negative property value, depending on the specific structure and context.

Given the simplicity of Cl\C=C/Cl compared to the more complex aromatic structures, and considering the influence of chlorine atoms, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be slightly positive. Therefore, I would predict a property value around 0.2 for Cl\C=C/Cl.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has several key features:
1. An ester linkage (COC(=O)).
2. A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1) attached to an amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23).
3. A pyridine-like structure (ccnc).
4. A chlorine substituent on an aromatic ring.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with ester linkages, such as CCCCOC(=O)CC and CCCCOC(=O)CC, tend to have negative property values.
- Aromatic rings with chlorine substituents, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1 and ClCCCl, tend to have positive property values.
- Amide linkages, as seen in CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2, have property values close to zero or slightly negative.

Considering these observations, the molecule in question has a combination of features that could lead to a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero. The presence of the ester and amide linkages suggests a negative contribution, while the aromatic chlorine might slightly offset this.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 would be around -0.1.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: 0.2550558553783619
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a terminal hydroxyl group, which is an alcohol (specifically, 1-pentanol).

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Linear alkanes like CCCCCC (hexane) have a property value of -0.25302082.
- Alcohols like OC1CCCCCCC1 (cycloheptanol) have a property value of 0.25505586.

The presence of the hydroxyl group in alcohols generally increases the property value compared to alkanes due to the polar nature of the hydroxyl group. Given that CCCCCO is a linear alcohol, we can expect its property value to be closer to that of other alcohols.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO (1-pentanol) would be around 0.25505586, similar to the value for cycloheptanol. However, since 1-pentanol is a linear alcohol and not cyclic, the value might be slightly lower but still positive.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCCCO could be approximately 0.25.

SMILES: CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1
True Property: 0.28060423144422025
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is often associated with polar and electron-withdrawing characteristics.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is also polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which can contribute to stability and hydrophobic interactions.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can add some polarity.

From the examples, molecules with polar groups like sulfonyl and amide tend to have negative property values, indicating a tendency towards certain electronic or solubility characteristics. For instance, molecules with sulfonyl groups like CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C have a property value of -4.63252715, and those with amide linkages like CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1 have a property value of -0.57505441.

Considering these factors, the presence of both sulfonyl and amide groups, along with the aromatic ring, suggests a property value that is likely negative and possibly in the range of other polar, electron-withdrawing group-containing molecules.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be around -1.0.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several functional groups and structural features that can influence its property value:

1. **Ester Groups (COC(=O))**: Esters are present in the molecule, which can contribute to a positive property value due to their electron-withdrawing nature.

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The presence of a nitro group is significant as it is a strong electron-withdrawing group, often leading to a more positive property value.

3. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: Aromatic rings are common in the examples and can contribute to both positive and negative property values depending on the substituents.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring (C1=C(C)NC)**: The presence of a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen can influence the property value, often leading to a more positive value due to the electron-withdrawing nature of nitrogen.

5. **Substituents (C, C(=O)OC)**: The presence of additional carbonyl and ester groups can further influence the property value positively.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples provided, the molecule has similarities with those that have positive property values, particularly due to the presence of ester and nitro groups, as well as the aromatic and heterocyclic structures.

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value for the given molecule to be approximately **0.85**.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two carbonyl groups (C=O) and a cyclohexane-like structure due to the cyclization of the peptide bond. This structure is relatively small and compact, with polar carbonyl groups and a non-polar cycloalkane core.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar features, such as small cyclic structures with carbonyl groups, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of -0.63176382, and it contains carbonyl groups and a cyclic structure.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is likely to be negative and in the range of similar cyclic structures with carbonyl groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.6.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure, consisting of a chloroethane (ethyl chloride) group. In the examples, small and relatively simple molecules like CCC (propane) and CC#N (acetonitrile) have property values around 0.31156365 and -0.71523969, respectively. The presence of a chlorine atom in ClCC might influence the property value, as seen in other chlorinated compounds in the examples.

Considering the examples with chlorinated compounds:
- Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) has a property value of -0.65477605.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (hexachlorobenzene) has a property value of 0.7511716.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (pentachlorobiphenyl) has a property value of 0.53874764.

These examples suggest that the presence of chlorine can lead to both negative and positive property values, depending on the structure and the number of chlorine atoms. However, ClCC is a small molecule with only one chlorine atom, similar to chlorobenzene, which has a negative property value.

Based on this analysis, the predicted property value for ClCC is likely to be slightly negative, similar to other small chlorinated compounds. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC is approximately:

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl contains:
- A chlorinated aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2 (-0.92381221) and Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (-1.44838949).
- A trichloromethyl group, similar to ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O (0.76091635) and Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (0.14969597).

The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in examples with high chlorine content. However, the presence of an aromatic ring with chlorine substitution tends to lower the property value, as seen in the examples with negative values.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is likely to be slightly negative, similar to the examples with chlorinated aromatic rings. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.9.

   - ClC(Cl)Cl (chloroform) has a property value of 1.15796831.
   - ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl (carbon tetrachloride) has a property value of 1.348965.
   - CI (iodomethane) has a property value of 1.05438158.

2. The presence of multiple halogen atoms, especially on an aromatic ring, tends to increase the property value. For example:
   - Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O has a property value of 1.17060025, which is relatively high due to the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and an aromatic structure.

Given these observations, we can infer that 1,4-dibromobenzene, with two bromine atoms on an aromatic ring, is likely to have a positive property value. Considering the trend of increasing property values with more halogen atoms and the aromatic nature of the compound, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around 1.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately 1.0.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl is less chlorinated than the example provided, as it has fewer chlorine atoms. This suggests that its property value might be slightly lower than 1.4545452 due to the reduced number of chlorine atoms, which could affect the electronic and steric properties of the molecule.

Considering this, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be slightly less than 1.4545452. A predicted value could be around 1.3 to 1.4. However, without more specific data or a clear trend from the examples, this is an estimation.

To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule in question is a nitrobenzene derivative with a methoxy group, which can be represented as a methoxybenzene (anisole) with a nitro group attached.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to increase the property value, as seen in O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O with a property value of 0.48908749.
- Methoxy groups (OCH3) are electron-donating and can influence the property value, but their effect is not as pronounced as nitro groups.
- Aromatic rings (phenyl groups) generally have negative property values, as seen in c1ccccc1O with a property value of -3.1873338.

Considering these factors, the presence of both a methoxy group and a nitro group on the benzene ring will likely result in a property value that is less negative than a simple phenol or benzene derivative but still influenced by the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around 0.4. This accounts for the electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group, which is somewhat counterbalanced by the electron-donating methoxy group.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 1.66185967. The given molecule has a similar high degree of chlorination and a complex cyclic structure, which suggests it might have a similar or slightly higher property value due to the additional chlorine atoms and the structural complexity.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl to be slightly higher than 1.66185967, possibly around 1.8.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.7787196903301661
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with ester groups (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1) tend to have property values around -0.25762624.
- Simple aliphatic chains (e.g., CCCCCCCC=C) have values around -0.11057022.
- The presence of oxygen in the form of esters or alcohols seems to slightly decrease the property value compared to purely aliphatic chains.

Given that CCCOC=O is a relatively simple ester with a short aliphatic chain, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be slightly negative, similar to other small esters in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O is approximately -0.25762624.

SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.7787196903301661
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a simple ester, specifically decanoate ester, with a long alkyl chain (10 carbons) and an ethyl group attached to the ester oxygen.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Molecules with long alkyl chains, such as CCCCCCCc1ccccc1, tend to have negative property values. The example CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 has a property value of -2.07644261.
2. Simple esters like CCCCOC have a property value of 0.25505586, which is slightly positive.

Considering the structure of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, it is more similar to the long alkyl chain example, but with an ester functional group, which might slightly increase the property value compared to a simple alkane.

Taking these observations into account, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would likely be slightly negative, but not as negative as the pure alkane example. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.5 to -1.0.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC could be approximately -0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O), which is known to be electron-withdrawing and can contribute to a more negative property value.
- Two chlorine atoms, which are also electron-withdrawing and can influence the property value.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is present in several examples with varying effects on the property value.
- Aromatic rings, which are common in the examples and can have varying effects depending on substitution.

Comparing with similar structures:
- Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -1.84701994, which is quite negative, likely due to the strong electron-withdrawing effects of the nitro and chloro groups.
- Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has a property value of -1.84701994, also negative, with multiple chloro groups and an ether linkage.

Given the presence of similar functional groups and the overall electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents, the property value for Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative and in a similar range to the examples with nitro and chloro groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately -1.84701994.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule contains two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O) and aromatic rings connected by a sulfur atom.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, have a property value of 0.16529198. Additionally, aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups tend to have negative property values, while those with electron-donating groups or neutral substituents can have positive values.

Considering the presence of two phosphorothioate groups and the aromatic system, the property value is likely to be positive but not extremely high, as seen in the example with a single phosphorothioate group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 0.2 to 0.3.

Based on this analysis, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 is approximately 0.25.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, have negative property values. The example Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.57505441.
- Molecules with phenol groups, such as Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, have a property value of 0.14969597, but this example also includes chlorine substituents.

Considering the structure of 4-nitrophenol, which combines the electron-withdrawing nitro group and the electron-donating hydroxyl group, the property value is likely to be negative, similar to other nitro-containing compounds.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be around -0.57505441, similar to the example of Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, as both contain a nitro group attached to a benzene ring. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. This molecule is a complex carbohydrate, likely a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide, characterized by multiple hydroxyl groups and ether linkages.

From the examples, it appears that molecules with more complex structures and multiple functional groups, especially those with polar groups like hydroxyls, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, which is a simpler carbohydrate, has a property value of 0.0. More complex structures with additional functional groups tend to have more negative values.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups in the given molecule, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. However, without a clear pattern or a specific model to quantify this, an exact prediction is challenging. Based on the trend observed, a reasonable estimate for the property value of this complex carbohydrate could be around -1.0.

- Linear alkanes and alkenes, such as CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO and CCCCCCCCCC=C, have property values around 0.25505586 and -0.11057022, respectively.
- Molecules with triple bonds, such as N#Cc1ccccc1C#N, have a property value of 0.25196813.

Considering the linear structure and the presence of a triple bond in CCC#C, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar to those of linear alkanes and alkynes. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCC#C is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Presence of Chlorine (Cl) Substituents**: The molecule contains three chlorine atoms attached to a benzene ring. In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings, such as Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, have positive property values (0.43021803 and 0.53874764, respectively).

2. **Phosphorothioate Group (P=S)**: The presence of a phosphorothioate group (P=S) is similar to the example COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 0.16529198. This suggests that the P=S group contributes positively to the property value.

3. **Ether Linkage (O-alkyl)**: The molecule has an ether linkage (O-alkyl), which is also present in some examples with positive property values, such as CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC (0.10172736).

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring and the phosphorothioate group are likely to contribute positively to the property value. Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be positive and similar to the examples with similar features.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is approximately **0.165**.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 contains a pyridine ring (a six-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen atom) and a hydrazide group (C(=O)NN). In the examples, similar structures with nitrogen-containing heterocycles and carbonyl groups tend to have property values around the range of -0.1 to 0.3.

For instance:
- Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2 has a property value of 0.32238539.
- Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.11468719.

Considering the presence of the pyridine ring and the hydrazide group, which might contribute to a slightly negative or near-zero property value, I would predict the property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 to be around -0.1.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is approximately -0.1.

True Property: 0.760916349344534
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, which has a property value of -2.66362712.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is present in several molecules with varying property values, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C (-1.69031292) and CCN2c1cc(N(C)C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23 (1.04499282).
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1), which is a saturated heterocyclic amine, similar to the cyclic structures in some examples.
- Alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC), which are common in many of the examples and generally contribute to less negative or positive property values.

Considering these features and the examples, the presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a more negative property value, while the alkyl chains and the piperidine ring might offset this to some extent. The amide linkage also contributes to a more negative value, but not as strongly as the phosphorothioate group.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around -2.5. This accounts for the strong influence of the phosphorothioate group, moderated by the other structural features.

Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some aspect of molecular stability, reactivity, or another physicochemical property. The examples show that aliphatic hydrocarbons, particularly those with simple linear or branched structures, tend to have property values around 0.25505586. For instance, molecules like CCC(O)CC, C/C1CCCCC1\C, and CCCCCCCO all have property values close to this number.

The molecule CCCCCCCC is a linear alkane (octane), similar in nature to the other aliphatic hydrocarbons mentioned. Given the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CCCCCCCC would also be around 0.25505586.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCC is 0.25505586.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbon-carbon triple bond (C#C). The presence of multiple rings and a hydroxyl group suggests some similarity to other polycyclic compounds in the examples, such as:

- CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of -1.15458701.
- CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO, which has a property value of -0.60309328.

Both of these examples have multiple rings and oxygen-containing functional groups, similar to the molecule in question. The presence of the hydroxyl group and the carbon-carbon triple bond might influence the property value, potentially making it more negative due to increased polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is likely to be in the range of the more negative values seen in similar structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately -1.0.

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings and methoxy groups. Based on the examples provided, molecules with complex polycyclic structures and multiple oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule with a complex polycyclic structure and multiple oxygen functionalities, such as C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21, has a property value of -0.36551207, while simpler structures with fewer oxygen functionalities tend to have lower or negative values.

Considering the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing groups in the given molecule, it is reasonable to predict a relatively high property value. However, the exact prediction requires careful consideration of the specific structural features and their contributions to the property value.

Based on the analysis and comparison with the provided examples, I would predict the property value for the given molecule to be approximately 0.86154198.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to some of the examples provided. For instance, the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.11468719, and it contains a phenol group with a nitro substituent. The molecule COc1c(O)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 0.28362334, and it contains multiple chlorine substituents on a phenol ring.

Considering the structure of Oc1ccccc1Cl, it is a phenol with a single chlorine substituent. The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) and the chlorine atom will influence the property value. Based on the examples, the presence of a single chlorine atom tends to increase the property value, while the hydroxyl group may have a neutral or slightly negative effect.

Taking these factors into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be slightly positive, but not as high as molecules with multiple chlorine atoms. Therefore, a predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl could be around 0.1.

The molecule contains:
- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C)
- An ester linkage (OC(=O))
- An amide group (NC(=O))
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with chlorinated aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (0.83629949) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (0.53874764), tend to have positive property values.
- Molecules with ester and amide groups, such as COC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OC (0.30861018) and CCOc1ccc(NC(=O)C)cc1 (-0.25762624), show a range of property values, but generally closer to zero.
- The presence of multiple chlorine atoms often increases the property value, as seen in ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl (1.66185967).

Considering these observations, the presence of the chloroalkyne and chlorinated aromatic ring in the target molecule suggests a positive contribution to the property value. The ester and amide groups may moderate this effect, but the overall influence of the chlorine atoms is likely to dominate.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be around 0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2) attached to the central carbon.
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have positive property values, especially when there are multiple chlorine atoms (e.g., ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, 1.51500372).
- The presence of a pyrimidine ring (as in Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2, 0.22267287) suggests a slightly positive contribution.
- Phenol groups (as in Oc1ccc(O)cc1, -1.30347995) tend to contribute negatively, but this effect might be mitigated by the presence of other positive-contributing groups.

Considering these factors, the molecule has a mix of features that could lead to a slightly positive property value. The presence of multiple aromatic rings with chlorine substituents and a pyrimidine ring suggests a positive contribution, while the phenol group might slightly reduce this effect.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl would be around 0.2 to 0.3. Therefore, I would predict a specific property value of approximately:

Given the structural similarity, particularly the presence of a carbonyl group adjacent to an ether linkage, and the linear alkyl chain, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CCCCCOC=O will be close to that of CCCCCCC=O.

True Property: -3.1873338018286446
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a methylphenol, specifically p-cresol, which is a phenol derivative with a methyl group attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe that phenol derivatives tend to have negative property values. For instance, Oc1cccc(O)c1 has a property value of -1.30347995, and c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC also has a property value of -1.30347995. These examples suggest that the presence of hydroxyl groups on aromatic rings tends to result in negative property values.

Considering the structure of Cc1cccc(C)c1O, which is similar to phenol but with an additional methyl group, we can infer that the property value will likely be negative, but not as negative as the examples with multiple hydroxyl groups or additional substituents that further decrease the property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be slightly less negative than -1.30347995, possibly around -1.0. However, without more specific data or a clear pattern for methylphenols, this is an estimation based on the trends observed in the examples.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a small hydrocarbon with a branched structure and a double bond.

From the examples, we can observe that small hydrocarbons with similar structures, such as alkanes and alkenes, tend to have property values around 0. For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCC (octane) has a property value of 0.31156365, and CCCCCCCC=C (nonene) has a property value of -0.11057022. These values suggest that small hydrocarbons with simple structures have property values close to zero, with slight variations depending on the specific structure and presence of functional groups.

Given that CC=C(C)C is a small hydrocarbon with a branched structure and a double bond, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be close to zero, similar to the other small hydrocarbons in the examples. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C is approximately 0.1.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 0.9331602828441236
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane), we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of chlorine atoms and the overall molecular structure.

In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, especially those with a high degree of chlorination, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of 1.17910961, and ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of 1.80638273. These examples suggest that the presence of chlorine atoms contributes positively to the property value.

Given that ClCCl is a simple molecule with two chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value, but likely lower than those of more complex, highly chlorinated structures.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl is approximately 0.5.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.1496959666318993
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Halogenated aromatic compounds, such as Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1, have relatively high property values (0.99924488).
2. The molecule Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which is 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, has a property value of 0.14969597.
3. The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) in aromatic compounds, such as in CC(O)c1ccccc1, tends to lower the property value significantly (-2.50083249).

Considering these observations, the presence of both chlorine atoms and a hydroxyl group in Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl suggests a balance between the electron-withdrawing effect of the chlorines and the electron-donating effect of the hydroxyl group. The property value is likely to be influenced by both these factors.

Given the examples and the nature of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl would be slightly higher than that of Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl due to the additional chlorine, but not as high as the fully halogenated compound. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.2.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 1.5351680635010059
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as aromatic rings. The presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups (ethers, esters, and phenolic groups) suggests a potential for moderate polarity. The examples provided show that molecules with similar complexity and functional groups tend to have property values that are not extremely high or low, often clustering around moderate values.

Given the structural complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen atoms, which can contribute to hydrogen bonding and dipole interactions, a moderate property value is likely. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.5. However, this is a qualitative assessment, and the actual value could vary based on specific interactions and the overall molecular conformation.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -2.2936736935363187
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C).

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with similar functional groups and structural features tend to have similar property values. For instance, the molecule CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a similar thiosemicarbazide moiety and a tert-butyl group, and its property value is -1.16395669.

Given the structural similarity, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C will be close to -1.16395669. Therefore, the predicted property value for this molecule is approximately -1.16.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.7856868747645065
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is an ester, specifically ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ethyl group (CCO) attached to a benzoate group (c1ccccc1C(=O)O).

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Simple esters like CCCCC(=O)OCC have a property value of -0.77871969.
2. Aromatic compounds with ester groups, such as CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, have a property value of 0.09824377.
3. The presence of an aromatic ring (c1ccccc1) tends to have a property value around -0.57505441 to 0.09824377, depending on the substituents.

Considering the structure of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, it is similar to the aromatic ester example CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, which has a property value of 0.09824377. However, CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is a simpler ester without additional carbonyl groups directly attached to the aromatic ring, which might slightly lower the property value.

Taking these observations into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be slightly lower than 0.09824377, but still positive due to the ester and aromatic nature. Therefore, a predicted property value could be approximately:

0.03482042

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.8454160250886064
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom at the end. In the examples, we have a similar molecule, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which is a brominated aromatic compound with a property value of -2.50083249. However, CCCCCCCBr is an alkyl bromide, not an aromatic compound, so its property value is likely to be different.

Another relevant example is CCCCCCCCO, which is a linear alkyl chain with an alcohol group, and it has a property value of 0.25505586. The presence of the bromine atom in CCCCCCCBr might have a different effect compared to the alcohol group in CCCCCCCCO.

Considering the examples and the nature of the molecule, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be slightly positive, as the linear alkyl chain contributes to a positive value, and the bromine atom might not significantly alter this trend.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr is approximately 0.2.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 0.2550558553783619
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the molecule carbon monoxide (CO) based on the examples provided is challenging due to the lack of direct analogs in the dataset. However, we can make an educated guess by considering the nature of CO as a small, simple diatomic molecule with a polar covalent bond.

In the examples, small and relatively simple molecules like CCC (propane) and CC#C (propyne) have property values around 0.31156365 and -0.51510358, respectively. Given that CO is a small molecule with a polar bond, it might have a property value closer to these smaller hydrocarbons, but potentially more negative due to its polarity and the presence of a triple bond-like character.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO could be around -0.5, considering its simplicity and polarity. However, this is a rough estimate and should be taken with caution.
