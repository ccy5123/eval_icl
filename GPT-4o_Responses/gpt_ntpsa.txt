SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 0.5052269186953964
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure containing an oxo group and a nitrogen atom. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with aromatic rings and heteroatoms.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with chlorine substituents, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, tend to have a property value of -0.67449076.
- Compounds with heteroatoms and carbonyl groups, such as Cc1[nH]c(=O)n(c(=O)c1Cl)C(C)(C)C, have positive property values, like 0.7324508.

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 combines features of both aromatic chlorination and heteroatom presence with a carbonyl group. However, the presence of the nitrogen and the carbonyl group in a heterocyclic ring might shift the property value towards a more positive value compared to simple chlorinated aromatics.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is likely to be slightly positive, but not as high as those with multiple carbonyl groups or extensive alkylation. A reasonable estimate, based on the examples, would be around 0.0718089, similar to C1SC(=S)NC1(=O), which also has a heterocyclic structure with a carbonyl group.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.43187925435687696
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains a nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an isopropyl group (CC(C)). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, have relatively high property values (1.40771094). However, the presence of aromatic rings or additional functional groups can influence the property value significantly.

Given that CC(C)N(=O)=O is a relatively simple molecule with a nitro group and no aromatic rings, it is likely to have a property value that is positive but not as high as more complex nitro-containing molecules with aromatic rings.

Based on the examples and the structural features of CC(C)N(=O)=O, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be around 0.5.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO

This molecule is a polycyclic compound with multiple rings and carbonyl groups, similar to some of the examples provided. Notably, it resembles the structure of steroids or complex terpenes, which often have specific stereochemistry and functional groups that influence their properties.

From the examples, we can observe that complex polycyclic structures with carbonyl groups, such as:

- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC, with a property value of 1.25588641
- O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, with a property value of 1.25588641

These examples have a similar complexity and presence of carbonyl groups, suggesting that the property value for the given molecule might be in a similar range.

Therefore, based on the structural similarities and the property values of the examples, I predict the property value for the molecule CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO to be approximately:

1.25588641

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.8181085637757942
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A benzene ring with two fluorine atoms (Fc1cccc(F)c1), similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.67449076.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N), which is a common feature in molecules with positive property values, such as CCC1(C(C)C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O (1.25588641) and NC(=O)c1cccnc1 (0.76117436).
- A chlorinated benzene ring (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -0.67449076.

The presence of the amide linkage suggests a potential for a positive property value, while the halogenated aromatic rings suggest a negative property value. The examples with amide linkages tend to have higher positive values, but the presence of multiple halogens, especially fluorine, often leads to negative values.

Considering these factors, the molecule's property is likely influenced by the negative contributions of the halogenated rings, but the amide linkage could mitigate this effect to some extent. Therefore, the predicted property value is likely to be slightly negative, but not as negative as the purely halogenated examples.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 is approximately -0.23671292.

True Property: -0.4377778427477369
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with a linear chain and a branching methyl group. It is similar in structure to other small aliphatic ethers and alcohols in the examples, such as CCCCCO (-0.15567144) and CCCCCC(O)CC (-0.15567144). These molecules have similar aliphatic chains and functional groups, which suggest that they might have similar properties.

Given the structural similarity to these examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CCCOC(C)C will be close to those of the similar molecules. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is approximately -0.15567144.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Alkyl Chain**: The molecule has a propyl group (CCC(C)) attached to the pyrrole ring. Alkyl chains generally contribute to a more negative property value, as seen in several examples like CCC(C)CC and CCC(C)CCO.

2. **Pyrrole Ring**: The presence of a pyrrole ring, which is a five-membered aromatic heterocycle, can influence the property value. In the examples, heterocycles like pyrrole and thiophene (e.g., Nc1nccs1) tend to have positive property values.

3. **Carbonyl Groups**: The molecule has two carbonyl groups (C=O), which can increase the polarity and potentially lead to a more positive property value. In the examples, molecules with carbonyl groups, such as O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC, tend to have positive property values.

4. **Bromine Atom**: The presence of a bromine atom can also affect the property value. In the examples, molecules with halogens like chlorine and bromine (e.g., CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1) have varied property values, but the presence of a bromine atom in an aromatic system can contribute to a more positive value.

Considering these factors, the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O has features that suggest a positive property value, particularly due to the presence of the pyrrole ring and carbonyl groups. Comparing it to similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.5, as it shares similarities with molecules like CCN(CC)C(=O)CSc1ccc(Cl)nn1, which has a property value of 0.50753506.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O is approximately **0.5**.

The molecule in question, c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, is biphenyl, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond.

In the examples, molecules with similar aromatic structures, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tend to have a property value of -0.67449076. This value appears frequently for molecules that are purely hydrocarbon-based and lack polar functional groups or heteroatoms.

Given that biphenyl is a simple aromatic hydrocarbon without any additional functional groups, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be similar to those of other hydrocarbon-based aromatic compounds in the examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2 (biphenyl) is -0.67449076.

The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) in CCCC(C)(C)CO suggests it might have a property value similar to other alcohols. The examples with alcohols tend to have property values around -0.15567144, which is different from the alkanes without the hydroxyl group.

Therefore, based on the structural similarity to other alcohols in the examples, the predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is likely to be:

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a cyclic compound with a urea-like structure, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of 1.25588641. The main difference between the two structures is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the given molecule, which could slightly alter the property value.

Considering the structural similarity and the effect of the additional alkyl chain, the property value for the given molecule is likely to be close to 1.25588641, but slightly higher due to the increased hydrophobicity and steric bulk from the additional alkyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be approximately 1.3.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached. In the examples, aromatic compounds with halogen substituents, such as Clc1ccc(I)cc1 and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, have a property value of -0.67449076. These examples suggest that the presence of halogens on aromatic rings tends to result in a negative property value.

Given that trifluoromethyl is a strong electron-withdrawing group and considering the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 will also be negative and similar to those of other halogenated aromatic compounds.

Therefore, the predicted property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is -0.67449076.

From the examples, we see that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (OH) tend to have higher property values. For instance, OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO has a property value of 2.43842515, which is quite high due to the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups.

Given that OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a cyclic form of a sugar with several hydroxyl groups, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be relatively high, similar to the linear sugar example.

Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately 2.43842515.

The molecule in question is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. From the examples, we observe that complex cyclic structures with multiple rings and carbonyl groups tend to have positive property values. For instance, CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C has a property value of 0.43777784, and CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C has a property value of 0.2821064.

Given the structural similarity of the molecule in question to these examples, particularly the presence of multiple rings and carbonyl groups, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. Considering the complexity and the presence of additional functional groups like esters, the property value might be slightly higher than the examples mentioned.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C would be approximately 0.5.

- A sulfonamide group (NS(=O)(=O))
- An aromatic ring (phenyl group) with an amine substituent
- A guanidine group (NC(=N)N)

To predict the property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in molecules with positive property values in the examples.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F), which can also contribute to a positive property value.
- An alkene group (CC(C)=C), which is not directly seen in the examples but can be considered neutral or slightly positive.
- An amine group (CCN), which is present in some molecules with both positive and negative property values.

Based on the examples, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, especially when combined with other electron-withdrawing groups like trifluoromethyl. The presence of multiple nitro groups and a trifluoromethyl group suggests a significant positive contribution.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.9 to 1.0, given the strong electron-withdrawing nature of the substituents and their influence on the overall molecular property.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O is approximately 0.95.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.0
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. In the examples, we have several esters and similar functional groups:

1. CC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of 0.0.
2. CCCCOC(=O)C has a property value of 0.0.
3. CCCCCCCOC(=O)C has a property value of 0.0.

These examples suggest that simple esters with similar structures tend to have a property value of 0.0. Given that CC(C)OC=O is a simple ester with no additional complex functional groups or aromatic rings, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be 0.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O is 0.0.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.1556714414457389
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Simple aromatic compounds with hydroxyl groups, such as phenol derivatives, tend to have property values around -0.15567144 (e.g., c1ccccc1O).
- The presence of additional methyl groups on the aromatic ring does not significantly alter the property value from the base phenol structure.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is likely to be close to that of phenol, which is -0.15567144. Therefore, the predicted property value for this molecule is:

-0.15567144

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 0.03564799070997976
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S), similar to the examples with the structure COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, all of which have a property value of 0.03564799. These examples have a common structural motif of a phosphorothioate group attached to an aromatic ring with halogen substituents.

The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 also has a phosphorothioate group attached to an aromatic ring, but instead of halogens, it has a thiomethyl (SC) and a methyl (C) group as substituents on the aromatic ring. The presence of the thiomethyl group introduces a sulfur atom, which could influence the property value.

Considering the structural similarity to the examples with a property value of 0.03564799 and the potential influence of the thiomethyl group, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be close to 0.03564799, but slightly adjusted due to the different substituents.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is approximately 0.03564799.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecules. The molecule in question, Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, is a chlorinated aromatic compound with multiple chlorine atoms attached to the aromatic rings.

From the examples, highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have negative property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -0.67449076, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl also has a property value of -0.67449076.

Given the similarity in structure and the presence of multiple chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl will also be -0.67449076.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.43187925435687696
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group attached. 

From the examples, we observe that:
- Simple aliphatic chains like CCC (propane) have a property value of -0.67449076.
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, have higher property values, such as 2.64461928.

However, the presence of a nitro group in a small aliphatic chain like CCCN(=O)=O is likely to increase the property value compared to a simple alkane but not as high as aromatic nitro compounds. 

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be slightly higher than that of a simple alkane but significantly lower than that of aromatic nitro compounds. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.5.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene ring with a bromine substituent. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with halogen substituents on benzene rings, such as Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, have a property value of -0.67449076.
- The presence of a single halogen substituent on a benzene ring tends to result in a negative property value around -0.67449076.

Given that Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar in structure to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, with a fluorine substituent instead of chlorine, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be similar to those examples with halogenated benzene rings.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is approximately -0.67449076.

True Property: -0.1556714414457389
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic structure with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane system with a hydroxyl group, which is similar to a norbornane derivative. 

Looking at the examples, we notice that molecules with similar bicyclic structures and hydroxyl groups, such as CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO, have relatively high property values (1.75752288). However, this example is more complex and contains additional functional groups that contribute to its higher value.

Simpler structures with alcohol groups, such as CCCCCCCC(C)O, have lower property values (-0.15567144). The presence of the bicyclic structure in our target molecule might increase the property value compared to a simple linear alcohol.

Considering these factors, the property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is likely to be positive but not as high as the more complex bicyclic structures with additional functional groups. A reasonable prediction would be around 0.2 to 0.3.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is approximately 0.23671292.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC) and a cyclic imide structure (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O). This structure is somewhat similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 0.75758392. The main difference is the presence of a thioether linkage (SC(CCl)) in the example, which is absent in the molecule in question.

Given the structural similarity, particularly the presence of the phosphorothioate group and the cyclic imide, the property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is likely to be close to that of the similar example. However, the absence of the thioether linkage might slightly reduce the property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be slightly lower than 0.75758392, but still positive. A predicted value could be around 0.7.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzodiazepine-like structure, featuring a carbonyl group attached to a nitrogen in a heterocyclic ring, and a phenyl group. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule CN2C(=C(O)c1ccccc1S2(=O)=O)C(=O)Nc3ccccn3, which has a property value of 1.87985447. However, the example molecule is more complex and contains additional functional groups that could contribute to a higher property value.

Another example, CNc1ccccc1, has a simpler structure with a property value of -0.36596894. The target molecule is more complex than this example due to the presence of the carbonyl group and the heterocyclic structure.

Considering the examples and the structural features of the target molecule, it is likely that the property value will be positive but not as high as the more complex example with a value of 1.87985447. A reasonable prediction, considering the balance of complexity and functional groups, would be around 0.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is approximately 0.5.

- CCCCCCC(=O)OC, which is an ester with a similar structure, having a property value of 0.0.
- CCCCCC(=O)OC, another ester with a similar structure, also having a property value of 0.0.

Both of these examples are esters with long alkyl chains and have a property value of 0.0. Given the structural similarity, it is reasonable to predict that CCCCCCC(=O)OCC will also have a property value of 0.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is methyl benzoate, which is an ester of benzoic acid.

From the examples, we can observe that esters and aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccc(O)cc1 has a property value of 0.51881932, and CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of 0.0. The presence of the methoxy group (COC) and the aromatic ring in methyl benzoate suggests a property value that is likely positive but not very high.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around 0.0, similar to the example of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1. Therefore, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is 0.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that molecules with halogen atoms, particularly those with multiple halogens or heavy halogens like bromine, tend to have negative property values. For instance, molecules such as Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 and Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl have property values of -0.67449076.

Given that BrC(Br)Br is a simple molecule with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon, it is likely to follow a similar trend. Therefore, the predicted property value for BrC(Br)Br is approximately -0.67449076.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule "CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O", we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S) with ethyl groups attached (CCOP(=S)(OCC)).
- A thioester linkage (SC(CCl)).
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl).
- A bicyclic structure with a benzene ring and a lactam (N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O).

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with complex structures, especially those containing heteroatoms like sulfur, nitrogen, and halogens, tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of aromatic rings and carbonyl groups also seems to contribute to positive property values.

Given these observations, the molecule in question has a complex structure with multiple functional groups, including a phosphorothioate, a thioester, and a bicyclic lactam with an aromatic ring. These features are similar to those in molecules with positive property values in the examples.

Therefore, I predict that the property value for "CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O" is likely to be positive. Based on the complexity and the presence of similar functional groups, a reasonable estimate for the property value would be around 0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Functional Groups and Structural Features:**
   - The molecule contains an amide group (C(=O)N), which is present in several examples with positive property values.
   - It has a chloro-substituted aromatic ring, similar to some examples with negative property values.
   - The molecule also contains a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen, which is seen in some examples with positive property values.
   - The presence of a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C) is a bulky substituent that can influence the property.

2. **Comparison with Examples:**
   - Molecules with amide groups and additional heteroatoms (e.g., NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1, 0.30134093) tend to have positive property values.
   - Chloro-substituted aromatic rings often have negative property values, but the presence of additional functional groups can alter this.
   - The presence of a nitro group (N(=O)=O) in some examples leads to high positive values, but this molecule lacks such a group.

3. **Balancing Factors:**
   - The combination of an amide group, chloro-substituted aromatic ring, and heterocyclic structure suggests a property value that is likely positive but not extremely high.
   - The tert-butyl group adds steric bulk, which can influence the property positively.

Based on these considerations, the predicted property value for CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C is likely to be moderately positive. A reasonable estimate, considering the examples, would be around 0.3 to 0.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately **0.4**.

The molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether. It has two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with chlorine atoms attached to each ring. 

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with aromatic rings and chlorine substituents, such as Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, have a property value of -0.15567144.

Given the structural similarity of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl to Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a property value of -0.15567144, and considering the additional ether linkage, which might slightly alter the property, the predicted property value for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is likely to be close to -0.15567144.

To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a tertiary amide with two phenyl rings and a tert-butyl group.

Another similar example is CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23, which has a property value of 0.15490206. This molecule also contains a tertiary amide, but with a more complex aliphatic ring system instead of phenyl rings.

Considering these comparisons, the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is likely to have a property value in a similar range to these examples, given the presence of the tertiary amide and aromatic rings. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.4.

- Molecules with a simple aromatic ring and halogen substituents, such as Fc1cccc(Br)c1 and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1, tend to have a property value of -0.67449076.
- Molecules with an amide group, such as CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, have a property value of -0.15361976.
- Molecules with both an amide group and a halogen substituent, such as CCNc1nc(Cl)nc(NC(C)C)n1, have a higher property value of 0.93428511.

Considering the structure of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1, it has both an amide group and a bromine substituent on the aromatic ring. This combination suggests that the property value might be influenced by both the presence of the amide group and the halogen substituent.

Based on these observations, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to be closer to the value of molecules with similar functional groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately -0.15567144, which is consistent with the presence of an amide group and a halogen substituent.

- Molecules with a benzene ring (c1ccccc1) and simple alkyl groups attached, such as CCc1ccc(C)cc1 and CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1, have a property value of -0.67449076.
- The presence of a benzene ring often correlates with a property value of -0.67449076, especially when the molecule is relatively simple and lacks additional functional groups that significantly alter the property.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is likely to be -0.67449076.

True Property: -0.23671291672885833
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Molecules with a benzene ring and electron-withdrawing groups (such as nitro groups) tend to have higher property values.
- Simple aromatic hydrocarbons without additional functional groups or with non-polar substituents tend to have lower or negative property values.

Benzaldehyde has an electron-withdrawing carbonyl group attached to the benzene ring, which can increase the property value compared to simple benzene derivatives without such groups.

Considering these observations, benzaldehyde is likely to have a property value that is positive but not as high as those with multiple electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups. A reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 would be around 0.3 to 0.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for O=Cc1ccccc1 is approximately 0.4.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, similar to the first example (Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2) which has a property value of 0.66859217.
- An aromatic ring with a heteroatom (oxygen), similar to the example c1c(Cl)cccc1c2ccccc2 with a property value of -0.67449076.
- A cyclic imide structure (O=C2CN...C(=O)N2), which is somewhat similar to the example CC12CC2(C)C(=O)N(C1=O)c3cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c3 with a property value of 0.28415808.

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of the nitro group and the aromatic ring with a heteroatom suggests a positive contribution, while the cyclic imide structure might moderate this effect.

Taking these into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be around 0.4.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group. This structure is similar to the example N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -0.04052074. The main difference between the two is the presence of a double-bonded nitrogen in the example, which is not present in the molecule we are analyzing.

Given the structural similarity and the fact that the presence of the double-bonded nitrogen in the example might slightly affect the electronic properties, we can predict that the property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 will be close to that of N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, but potentially slightly different due to the absence of the double bond.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be approximately -0.04052074, with a slight adjustment to account for the structural difference. However, without more specific data or a clear trend from the examples, it is challenging to provide a more precise adjustment. Thus, the predicted property value remains close to -0.04052074.

In the examples, similar cyclic structures with amide groups, such as C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1 (0.90120172) and O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC (1.25588641), have property values around 0.9 to 1.3.

Considering the structural similarity to these examples, particularly the presence of the diketopiperazine core, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 would be around 1.0. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples provided, we can observe that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, especially those with aromatic rings, tend to have negative property values. For instance:

- Clc1ccccc1Cl has a property value of -0.67449076.
- Ic1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.67449076.
- ClCC(C)C has a property value of -0.67449076.
- Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a property value of -0.67449076.

These examples suggest that the presence of chlorine atoms, particularly in aromatic systems, is associated with a property value of approximately -0.67449076.

Given that Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a similar structure with multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will also be around -0.67449076.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is -0.67449076.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

In the examples, simple aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions, such as Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) with a property value of -0.00718089, tend to have property values close to zero. The presence of additional alkyl groups, as seen in CCC(=O)C (acetone) with a property value of -0.23671292, suggests that the property value might be slightly negative.

Considering the structure of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, which is similar to other alkyl-substituted aromatic compounds, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be slightly negative, but close to zero. Therefore, a predicted property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 could be approximately:

SMILES: Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O
True Property: 1.5356846645421494
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is a sulfonamide derivative, which contains a benzene ring (phenyl group) attached to a sulfonamide group. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) attached to aromatic rings tend to have higher property values, often above 1.0. For instance, Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of 1.09918912.

The presence of the sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) in the target molecule is somewhat similar to the nitro group in terms of electron-withdrawing effects, but it is generally less electron-withdrawing than a nitro group. Therefore, we can expect the property value to be somewhat lower than those with nitro groups directly attached to the aromatic ring.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be slightly below 1.0, but still positive due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the sulfonamide group.

A predicted property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O could be approximately 0.8.

The molecule you provided, c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically triphenylene.

From the examples, it seems that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as those with multiple benzene rings fused together, tend to have a property value of -0.67449076. This is consistent with other similar structures in the examples, such as c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 and c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54, which also have this property value.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the more complex aromatic structures in the examples, particularly those with multiple hydroxyl groups and aromatic rings, which tend to have higher property values.

For instance, the molecule Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 has a property value of 1.03763864, and it shares some structural similarities with the target molecule, such as the presence of multiple aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups.

Considering these structural similarities and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 is likely to be in the higher range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately 1.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we need to consider the structural features and functional groups present in the molecule and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphoric acid ester group (P=O and P-O-C)
- A thioester linkage (C-S-C)
- An amide group (NC(C)=O)

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with phosphoric acid ester groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl (0.03564799) and CCN(CC)C(=O)C(=CCOP(=O)(OC)OC)Cl (0.99429683), have positive property values.
- Molecules with amide groups, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (0.0718089) and NC(=O)c1cccnc1 (0.76117436), also tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of sulfur, as in thioesters, can influence the property value, but the examples do not provide a direct comparison for thioesters.

Considering these observations, the presence of the phosphoric acid ester and amide groups suggests a positive property value. The thioester linkage might slightly modify this value, but the overall influence of the functional groups points towards a positive value.

Based on the structural similarities and the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around 0.1 to 0.5. Given the examples, a specific prediction could be:

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is a simple alkene with two chlorine atoms attached to the double-bonded carbons. This structure is relatively simple and does not contain any aromatic rings or complex functional groups that are associated with higher property values in the examples.

Based on the examples, molecules with similar simplicity and halogenation, such as CCBr and CCCBr, have a property value of -0.67449076. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that Cl\C=C/Cl will have a similar property value.

True Property: 1.676737865193148
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has several key features:
1. A benzene ring with a carbonyl group (C=O) attached, similar to acetophenone derivatives.
2. An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23), which is a common feature in several molecules with positive property values.
3. A chlorinated aromatic ring, which is present in several examples with negative property values.
4. An ether linkage (OCC(O)COC(=O)), which is present in molecules with both positive and negative property values, but often contributes to a more positive value when combined with other positive features.

Comparing these features with the examples:
- Molecules with amide linkages and aromatic rings, such as CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2 (0.78194765) and CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1OC(C)C (0.54523474), tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of a chlorinated aromatic ring often contributes to a negative property value, but in this case, it is part of a larger structure that includes positive-contributing features.

Considering the balance of these features, the predicted property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 is likely to be positive, but not as high as the most positive examples due to the presence of the chlorinated ring.

A reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 0.5.

SMILES: CCCCCO
True Property: -0.1556714414457389
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecules. Aliphatic hydrocarbons, particularly those with simple linear or branched structures without significant functional groups, tend to have negative property values. For instance, molecules like "CCCCCCCI" and "CCC(C)Cl" have property values of -0.67449076.

The molecule "CCCCCO" is a linear aliphatic alcohol. The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) might slightly increase the property value compared to a simple alkane, but it is still likely to be negative given the trend observed with similar molecules.

Therefore, the predicted property value for "CCCCCO" is likely to be slightly higher than -0.67449076 but still negative. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.15567144, similar to other simple alcohols like "OC1CCCCCCC1".

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is often associated with polar and electron-withdrawing characteristics.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is also polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which is common in many of the examples and often associated with a range of property values depending on the substituents.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can contribute to polarity.

From the examples, molecules with polar functional groups like amides, sulfonyls, and ethers tend to have positive property values, especially when combined with aromatic rings. For instance, molecules with amide and aromatic structures, such as O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC, have positive property values (1.25588641).

Considering these factors, the presence of both the sulfonyl and amide groups, along with the aromatic ring, suggests a positive property value. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be around 0.8.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several functional groups and structural features that can influence its property value:

1. **Ester Groups (COC(=O))**: Esters are present in the molecule, which can contribute to a positive property value, as seen in some examples with ester groups.

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The presence of a nitro group is often associated with a positive property value, as seen in examples like "Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O" with a property value of 0.43187925.

3. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: Aromatic rings are common in many examples with negative property values, but the presence of additional functional groups can alter this.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring (C1=C(C)NC)**: The presence of a heterocyclic ring with nitrogen can influence the property value, potentially making it more positive.

Considering these structural features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule has a combination of ester and nitro groups, which are associated with positive property values. Therefore, the predicted property value for this molecule is likely to be positive.

Based on the analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately **0.43187925**, similar to other molecules with nitro groups.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. This structure is characterized by a six-membered ring containing two amide groups. 

Looking at the examples, we notice that molecules with cyclic structures and multiple carbonyl groups, such as diketones or cyclic amides, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of 0.94736459, and OC3N=C(c1ccccc1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2NC3=O has a property value of 0.90761323. These examples suggest that the presence of carbonyl groups in a cyclic structure contributes to a positive property value.

Given the structure of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, which is a cyclic structure with two carbonyl groups, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. However, since it is a relatively simple structure compared to the more complex examples with higher positive values, the property value might be lower than those examples.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around 0.5.

The molecule in question is a triaryl phosphate ester, which includes three aromatic rings and a phosphate group. The presence of aromatic rings and a phosphate group suggests that the molecule might have a property value similar to other aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (such as carbonyls, nitro groups, or halogens) tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule Clc1ccc(CN(C2CCCC2)C(=O)Nc3ccccc3)cc1 has a property value of 0.15490206, and the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C has a property value of 1.38668119.

Considering the structural similarity of the given molecule to these examples, particularly the presence of multiple aromatic rings and a phosphate group, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. However, the exact value will depend on the specific interactions and electronic effects of the substituents.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1 would be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to be electron-withdrawing and can increase the molecule's polarity.
- An aromatic ring, which is common in many of the examples.
- A nitrogen atom in a heterocyclic ring, which can contribute to the molecule's electronic properties.
- Chlorine atoms, which are also electron-withdrawing and can affect the molecule's overall polarity and reactivity.
- A ketone group (C=O), which is polar and can influence the molecule's properties.

Looking at the examples, molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (NO2) or trifluoromethyl (CF3) tend to have higher property values, often above 0.4. The presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups and polar functionalities in the molecule suggests that it might have a relatively high property value.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O would be around 0.43187925, similar to other molecules with electron-withdrawing groups and aromatic rings.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of 1.53824927, and it contains two nitro groups attached to a benzene ring.

The molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has one nitro group and one methoxy group, which is an electron-donating group. The presence of both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups can influence the property value. The methoxy group may slightly reduce the positive effect of the nitro group compared to a molecule with two nitro groups.

Considering these factors, the property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is likely to be positive but less than that of a dinitrobenzene. A reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.5.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of -0.67449076. Both molecules are heavily chlorinated and contain multiple chlorine atoms attached to a cyclic structure. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally leads to a lower property value, as seen in the examples.

Given the structural similarity and the pattern observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl will also be around -0.67449076. Therefore, the predicted property value for this molecule is:

- CCCCC(CC)C=O has a property value of -0.23671292.
- CCCCC=C(CC)C=O also has a property value of -0.23671292.
- CCCCOC has a property value of -0.43777784.

Given the similarity in structure, particularly the presence of a long alkyl chain and an ester group, it is reasonable to predict that CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC will have a property value in the negative range, similar to the examples with long alkyl chains and simple functional groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately -0.23671292.

SMILES: Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O
True Property: 1.696998234013928
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phenol group (Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1), which is similar to the structure in Oc1ccc2ccccc2c1 with a property value of -0.15567144.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is present in several molecules with varying property values.
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O), which is present in Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O with a property value of 0.43187925.
- Two chlorine atoms, which are present in several molecules with varying property values.

The presence of the nitro group and the amide linkage suggests a positive contribution to the property value, as seen in molecules with similar functional groups. The phenol group and chlorine atoms may contribute to a less positive or slightly negative value, but the overall structure suggests a positive property value due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group and the potential resonance stabilization.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O would be around 0.4.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- Two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O).
- Aromatic rings connected by a sulfur atom (Sc2ccc...cc2).
- Ether linkages (OC).

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, have a property value of 0.31980607.
- Molecules with aromatic rings and ether linkages, such as COc2cnc1ncncc1n2, have a property value of 0.8845318.

The molecule in question is more complex due to the presence of two phosphorothioate groups and multiple aromatic rings. The presence of these groups suggests that the property value might be higher than 0.31980607 but potentially lower than 0.8845318, given the additional complexity and the presence of multiple aromatic systems.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 would be around 0.6. This value reflects the influence of the phosphorothioate groups and the aromatic systems, balancing between the examples provided.

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.9506985723877331
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we have:
- Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which is nitrotoluene, with a property value of 0.43187925.
- Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2, which is a dinitro compound, with a property value of 0.66859217.

The presence of the nitro group generally increases the property value compared to the base aromatic compound. The hydroxyl group in phenol can also contribute to a higher property value due to its electron-donating nature, which can affect the overall electronic properties of the molecule.

Considering these factors, the property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to the nitrotoluene example, but potentially slightly higher due to the additional influence of the hydroxyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O would be approximately 0.5.

OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O

This molecule is a complex carbohydrate, likely a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide, given the multiple sugar rings and hydroxyl groups. In the examples provided, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic structures, such as sugars, tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, which is a sugar-like structure, has a property value of 1.63749943.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCC#C is a simple alkyne with a terminal triple bond. 

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Simple linear alkanes and alkenes, such as CCCCCCCCCC=O and CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO, tend to have negative property values around -0.15567144.
- Molecules with aromatic rings and additional functional groups tend to have more positive or varied property values.
- The presence of a triple bond, as seen in N#Cc1ccccc1C#N, which has a property value of 0.54574766, suggests that the presence of a triple bond can increase the property value compared to simple alkanes.

Given that CCC#C is a small molecule with a triple bond, it is likely to have a property value that is slightly higher than that of simple alkanes but not as high as more complex aromatic or functionalized molecules. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around 0.0, as it is a small, relatively simple molecule with a triple bond.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S) with ethyl groups attached (CCOP(=S)(CC)).
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents (Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl).

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms on aromatic rings, such as Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl, tend to have a property value of -0.67449076.
- Molecules with a phosphorothioate group, such as COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, have a positive property value (0.31980607).

The molecule in question combines features from both types of examples. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring suggests a negative contribution, while the phosphorothioate group suggests a positive contribution.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be slightly positive, but not as high as the example with the phosphorothioate group and fewer chlorines. A reasonable estimate would be around 0.31980607, similar to the example with a phosphorothioate group and chlorinated aromatic ring.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule is approximately 0.31980607.

This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2, which has a high property value of 1.90165361. Both molecules contain nitrogen heterocycles and carbonyl groups, which might contribute to a higher property value.

However, the presence of the hydrazide group (C(=O)NN) in the target molecule could influence the property differently compared to the example with the imidazole ring. The examples with nitro groups, such as Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, also show high property values, suggesting that electron-withdrawing groups can increase the property value.

Considering these factors, the target molecule is likely to have a positive property value, but not as high as the example with the imidazole ring. A reasonable prediction, considering the structural similarities and differences, would be a property value around 1.0.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is approximately 1.0.

- Molecules with piperidine rings, such as CCN2c1cc(N(C)C)cc(C)c1NC(=O)c3cccnc23, have moderate property values (0.56857263).

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values, the presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a higher property value, while the amide linkage and piperidine ring suggest a moderate value.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around 0.5.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbonyl group (C=O), similar to some of the examples given. It also contains a triple bond (C#C), which is a unique feature compared to the examples.

From the examples, we observe that polycyclic compounds with carbonyl and hydroxyl groups tend to have positive property values. For instance:
- CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO has a property value of 1.75752288.
- CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O has a property value of 0.2821064.

The presence of the triple bond (C#C) might slightly influence the property value, but given the overall structure, it is likely to have a positive impact similar to the other polycyclic compounds with carbonyl and hydroxyl groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C would be around 0.7 to 1.0. Given the examples and the structural similarities, a specific prediction could be:

To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of the thiosemicarbazide moiety suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and polar interactions, which could increase the property value. The tert-butyl group is a bulky, non-polar group that might slightly reduce the property value due to its hydrophobic nature.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar functional groups and structural features, such as CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C (1.10944754) and Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2 (1.1666382), have property values around 1.1 to 1.2.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ethyl group (CCO) attached to a benzoate group (c1ccccc1C(=O)O).

Looking at the examples, we have:

- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 with a property value of 2.60281624. This molecule is more complex and contains additional functional groups like sulfonamide and a heterocyclic ring, which likely contribute to its higher property value.
- CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O with a property value of 0.20106493. This molecule is a diketone with a phenyl group, similar to the benzoate group in our target molecule, but with additional carbonyl groups.
- CCCCC(=O)OCC with a property value of 0.0. This is a simple ester similar to our target molecule but with an aliphatic chain instead of an aromatic ring.

Given that CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ester with an aromatic ring, it is likely to have a property value between the simple aliphatic ester (0.0) and the more complex aromatic structures. The presence of the aromatic ring might increase the property value slightly compared to the aliphatic ester.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around 0.1.

Iteration: 99
SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the presence of certain functional groups and structural features can influence the property value.

In the given examples, molecules with halogen atoms like Cl or Br, especially when attached to aromatic rings, often have a property value of -0.67449076. However, in the case of aliphatic chains with halogens, the property value can vary. For instance, the molecule CI has a property value of -0.67449076, and CCCCCCCCO has a property value of -0.15567144.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a straight-chain alkane with a bromine atom at the end. This structure is similar to CCCCCCCCO, which has a slightly negative property value. Given the pattern observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict that CCCCCCCBr will have a property value close to that of CCCCCCCCO.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr is approximately -0.15567144.

SMILES: CO
True Property: -0.1556714414457389
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are related to the molecular structure and possibly the presence of certain functional groups or structural features. The examples with simple hydrocarbons or halogenated compounds tend to have negative property values, while more complex molecules with functional groups like nitro, carbonyl, or heterocycles tend to have positive values.

The molecule CO (carbon monoxide) is a simple diatomic molecule without any of the complex features or functional groups that are associated with positive property values in the examples. It is more similar in simplicity to the hydrocarbons and halogenated compounds that have negative property values.

Therefore, based on the pattern observed, I would predict that the property value for CO is likely to be negative. A reasonable prediction, considering the trend for simple molecules, would be:

-0.67449076
