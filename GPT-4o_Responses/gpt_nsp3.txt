The molecule in question is a cyclic compound with a urea-like structure (a diketopiperazine) and an alkyl side chain. The closest example in the list is O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of 0.03372454. The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of an additional alkyl group (C(C)CCC) in the molecule we are analyzing.

Considering the examples, molecules with larger alkyl chains or more complex structures tend to have slightly higher property values, likely due to increased hydrophobicity or steric effects. Therefore, the presence of the additional alkyl group in the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would likely increase the property value slightly compared to the similar example.

Based on this reasoning, I would predict the property value for O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C to be slightly higher than 0.03372454, perhaps around 0.1.

From the examples, molecules with strong electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups (N(=O)=O) and multiple halogens (Cl, Br) tend to have negative property values. The presence of aromatic rings with electron-donating groups like amines can also influence the property value.

The molecule in question has a sulfonamide group, which is electron-withdrawing, and an aromatic amine, which is electron-donating. The guanidine group is also electron-donating. The combination of these groups suggests a balance between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects.

Considering the examples:
- Molecules with strong electron-withdrawing groups and aromatic rings tend to have negative values.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.20234722784297857
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples. For instance, the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1 (a methyl-substituted benzene) has a property value of -0.04496605, and c1ccccc1O (phenol) has a property value of -0.67449076. The presence of the hydroxyl group (O) in phenol seems to significantly lower the property value compared to methyl-substituted benzene.

Considering the structure of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, which combines features of both methyl-substituted benzene and phenol, we can expect its property value to be between those of Cc1cccc(C)c1 and c1ccccc1O. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be around -0.40469446, which is similar to other aromatic compounds with electron-donating groups like methyl and hydroxyl.

True Property: 0.08093889113719145
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A central phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OC)O) similar to the examples COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, all of which have a property value of -0.20234723.
- An aromatic ring with substituents: a methoxy group (OC), a thiomethyl group (SC), and a methyl group (C).

The presence of the phosphorothioate group and the aromatic ring with substituents suggests that the property value might be similar to the examples with similar structural features. The examples with the phosphorothioate group and halogenated aromatic rings consistently have a property value of -0.20234723.

Therefore, based on the structural similarity to these examples, the predicted property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be -0.20234723.

True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group attached to the terminal carbon. In the examples, simple aliphatic chains like CCC (1.21408337) and CCCCCCCO (1.21408337) have high property values, while molecules with nitro groups, such as O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O (-0.67449076) and CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O (0.34243377), tend to have lower property values.

Given that CCCN(=O)=O is a small molecule with a nitro group, it is likely to have a property value lower than simple aliphatic chains but potentially higher than more complex aromatic nitro compounds. Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around 0.34243377, similar to the example with a nitro group on an aliphatic chain.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCN(=O)=O is approximately 0.34243377.

These examples suggest that the presence of halogens on a benzene ring, particularly chlorine and bromine, results in a negative property value around -0.67449076. The presence of fluorine, another halogen, is likely to have a similar effect, as seen in:
- Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, which also has a property value of -0.67449076.

Given these observations, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 will also be approximately -0.67449076.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Simple aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., nitro groups) tend to have negative property values.
- Simple hydrocarbons, especially those with alkyl chains or non-polar groups, tend to have positive property values, often around 1.21408337.
- The presence of polar functional groups or heteroatoms can decrease the property value.

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a non-polar hydrocarbon with no electron-withdrawing groups or heteroatoms, it is likely to have a positive property value similar to other non-polar hydrocarbons in the examples.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is approximately 1.21408337.

To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O contains a nitro group (S(N)(=O)=O) attached to a benzene ring. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups attached to aromatic rings, such as Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O and Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, have property values of -0.67449076 and -0.40469446, respectively.

- An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23)
- A pyridine ring (c2ccnc3)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (cc(Cl)ccc23)

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens (Cl, Br, I) often have negative property values, especially when multiple halogens are present.
- Molecules with hydroxyl groups and simple aliphatic chains tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of ester and amide linkages can influence the property value, often leading to values closer to zero or slightly negative.

Given these observations, the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 has a combination of features that suggest a property value that is slightly negative. The presence of the chlorinated aromatic ring and the amide linkage, along with the ester group, suggests a property value similar to those of other molecules with aromatic and halogenated features.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.33111365, which is consistent with other molecules containing aromatic rings, halogens, and amide linkages.

For the molecule CCCCCO (1-pentanol), we can observe that it is a linear alcohol with a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a five-carbon chain. In the examples, linear alkanes and alcohols with similar structures, such as OC1CCCCCCC1 and CCCCCCCI, have a property value of 1.21408337. This suggests that the presence of a hydroxyl group in a linear alkane chain contributes to a higher property value.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), which is often associated with polar and electron-withdrawing characteristics.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is also polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.
- An aromatic ring (c2ccccc2), which is common in many of the examples with negative property values.
- An ether linkage (CCO), which can contribute to some polarity.

From the examples, molecules with significant polar groups, especially those with sulfonyl or nitro groups, tend to have negative property values. For instance, molecules like Oc1ccc(O)cc1 and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 have negative values, and they contain polar groups or halogens.

Given the presence of the sulfonyl group and the amide linkage, along with the aromatic ring, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for this molecule. The structure suggests it might have similar characteristics to other molecules with negative values.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several functional groups and structural features that can influence its property value:

1. **Ester Groups (COC(=O))**: The presence of ester groups is common in molecules with positive property values, as seen in examples like CCCCCC(=O)OC (0.89932101) and CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC (0.83636854).

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The nitro group is often associated with negative property values, as seen in examples like Cc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-0.40469446) and CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O (0.34243377).

3. **Aromatic Ring (c2ccccc2)**: Aromatic rings are present in both positive and negative property value examples, so their influence is more context-dependent.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring (C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1...))**: Heterocyclic rings with nitrogen can contribute to negative property values, as seen in examples like CN(C)c2c(C)n(C)n(c1ccccc1)c2=O (-0.09339103).

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values in the examples, the presence of both ester and nitro groups suggests a potential balancing effect. However, the nitro group and heterocyclic nitrogen might have a stronger influence towards a negative property value.

Based on this analysis, the predicted property value for the molecule COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C is likely to be negative, and a reasonable estimate would be around -0.1 to -0.2, considering the examples provided.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. This structure is characterized by a six-membered ring containing two amide groups. 

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar cyclic amide structures, such as those containing aromatic rings or multiple carbonyl groups, tend to have negative property values. For instance, molecules like Clc1cccc(I)c1, c1ccncc1, and Clc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which have aromatic or cyclic structures with electronegative atoms, have property values around -0.67449076.

Given the cyclic nature and the presence of carbonyl groups in the diketopiperazine, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be negative and similar to those of other cyclic or aromatic compounds with electronegative atoms.

Therefore, the predicted property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately -0.67449076.

The molecule ClCC is a simple aliphatic compound with a chlorine atom attached to a short carbon chain. The presence of the chlorine atom suggests that the property value might be lower than that of a simple hydrocarbon like CCCC, but not as low as those with multiple halogen substitutions or aromatic rings.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be around 0.2697963, similar to the value for CC#N, which is another small molecule with a polar group.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with halogen substituents, such as chlorobenzene derivatives, tend to have negative property values. For instance, compounds like Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl and Oc1cc(Cl)cc(Cl)c1 have property values of -0.67449076. These examples suggest that the presence of halogens on an aromatic ring contributes to a negative property value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 would be around -0.1.

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can see that molecules with nitro groups attached to aromatic rings, such as Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O and Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2, have negative property values. Specifically, Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.40469446.

Given the structural similarity of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O to Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O will also be negative and close to -0.40469446.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.40469446.

True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O

This molecule is a complex sugar, likely a polysaccharide or a similar carbohydrate structure, characterized by multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups and ether linkages. In the examples provided, molecules with similar characteristics, such as multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic ether structures, tend to have higher property values, often around 1.21408337. This is seen in molecules like:

- CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC (a long-chain alkane)
- CC(C)CC(C)(C)O (a branched alcohol)
- C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O (a sugar-like structure)

Given the structural similarity of the molecule in question to these examples, particularly the sugar-like structure with multiple hydroxyl groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value will be similar to those of the sugar-like structures.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O is approximately:

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 0.26979630379063807
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne. In the examples, we have several hydrocarbons and their derivatives, and we can observe a pattern where simple hydrocarbons, especially those with longer carbon chains, tend to have positive property values. For instance, linear alkanes and alkenes like CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO and CCCCCCCCCC=C have positive values (1.21408337 and 0.83636854, respectively).

However, the presence of a triple bond (as in alkynes) can influence the property value. The examples do not provide a direct comparison for a simple alkyne, but we can infer from the pattern that the presence of unsaturation (double or triple bonds) tends to lower the property value compared to saturated hydrocarbons.

Given this reasoning, CCC#C is likely to have a property value that is positive but lower than that of a saturated hydrocarbon of similar size. Considering the examples and the influence of the triple bond, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around 0.7.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl
True Property: 0.08093889113719145
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule "CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl", we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S) with ethyl groups attached.
- An aromatic ring with three chlorine substituents.

From the examples, we observe:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms on an aromatic ring, such as "Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl" and "Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl", have property values of -0.67449076.
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as "COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1", have a property value of 0.19715884.

The presence of multiple chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring suggests a negative contribution to the property value, similar to the examples with values around -0.67449076. However, the presence of the phosphorothioate group, which in a similar context had a positive contribution, suggests a balancing effect.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for "CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl" would likely be slightly negative, but not as negative as the examples with only chlorinated aromatic rings. A reasonable estimate, balancing these influences, would be around -0.23012038, similar to the example "c1ccc(Cl)cc1C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)(O)C(=O)OC(C)C", which also has a mix of chlorine and other functional groups.

SMILES: c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1
True Property: -0.6744907594765952
Predicted Property:
Based on the examples provided, it seems that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and structural features. Molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups, such as nitro groups or halogens, tend to have negative property values. Molecules with aliphatic chains or those that are more saturated tend to have positive property values.

The molecule in question, c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, contains a pyridine ring (an aromatic nitrogen-containing ring) and a hydrazide group (C(=O)NN). The presence of the pyridine ring, which is similar to other aromatic systems in the examples, suggests a tendency towards a negative property value. Additionally, the hydrazide group is somewhat electron-withdrawing, which could further contribute to a negative value.

Given these considerations, the predicted property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is likely to be negative. Based on the pattern observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately -0.67449076, which is a common value for aromatic systems with electron-withdrawing groups.

True Property: 1.0791852151625523
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Aliphatic Chains and Branching**: The molecule contains aliphatic chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC) and a cyclic amine (N1CCCCC1). Molecules with similar aliphatic chains and branching, such as C/C1CCCCC1\C and C/C1CCC(\C)CC1, have property values around 1.21408337.

2. **Functional Groups**: The molecule has a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCCC)S) and an amide linkage (C(=O)N). The presence of sulfur and phosphorus in the structure is somewhat similar to COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, which has a property value of -0.04496605.

3. **Cyclic Structures**: The presence of a piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1) is a feature that can influence the property. Cyclic structures like CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO have property values around 0.85435496.

Considering these structural features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule has a mix of aliphatic, cyclic, and functional group characteristics. The presence of the phosphorothioate group and the cyclic amine suggests a property value that is likely positive but not as high as purely aliphatic or cyclic hydrocarbons.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be around **0.58455866**.

The examples with property values of 1.21408337 are generally simple aliphatic alcohols or hydrocarbons, while those with negative values often contain aromatic rings, halogens, or nitro groups.

The molecule CCCCCCCC is a simple linear alkane (octane), which is similar in nature to other simple hydrocarbons like CCCCCC (hexane) or CCCCCCCO (heptanol), which have a property value of 1.21408337.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbonyl group (C=O), similar to some of the examples given. It also contains a triple bond (C#C), which is a unique feature compared to the examples.

Looking at the examples, polycyclic compounds with hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, such as CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO (0.6990177) and CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O (0.91588745), tend to have property values in the range of 0.7 to 0.9. The presence of the triple bond might slightly lower the property value due to its potential impact on the overall molecular stability or reactivity.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C would be around 0.8. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is:

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings. Let's break down the key features:

1. **Aromatic Rings**: The molecule contains multiple aromatic rings, similar to many of the examples with negative property values.
2. **Ether and Ester Linkages**: The presence of ether and ester groups is common in molecules with both positive and negative property values, but the complexity and number of these groups in this molecule suggest a more negative influence.
3. **Polycyclic Structure**: The molecule has a complex polycyclic structure, which is often associated with negative property values in the examples provided.

Given these observations, the molecule shares more structural similarities with those examples that have negative property values, particularly those with complex aromatic and polycyclic structures. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for this molecule.

To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a methylphenol, specifically p-cresol, which is a phenol derivative with a methyl group attached to the benzene ring. In the examples, phenol derivatives such as Oc1cccc(O)c1 and Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O have property values of -0.67449076. Additionally, the molecule CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, which is a similar structure with an additional methyl group, has a property value of 0.08093889.

Given that Cc1cccc(C)c1O is structurally similar to these examples, particularly to phenol derivatives, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be closer to those of phenol derivatives. However, the presence of the methyl group may slightly increase the property value compared to phenol itself.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cccc(C)c1O would be slightly higher than -0.67449076, but not as high as 0.08093889. A balanced estimate could be around -0.40469446, which is a value seen for other aromatic compounds with similar functional groups.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and shape of the molecule.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a small hydrocarbon with a branched structure and a double bond. In the examples, small hydrocarbons with similar structures, such as alkanes and alkenes, tend to have positive property values. For instance, CCCCCC (hexane) has a property value of 1.21408337, and CCCCCCC (heptane) has a property value of 1.21408337 as well. These values are relatively high and positive, indicating that the property in question might be related to hydrophobicity or some other property that increases with the size and hydrophobic character of the molecule.

Given that CC=C(C)C is smaller than hexane and heptane but still a hydrocarbon, we can expect its property value to be positive but lower than those of the larger alkanes. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around 0.8 to 1.0.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value for CC=C(C)C to be approximately 0.9.

In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values, often around -0.67449076. For instance, molecules like Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 and Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl have this property value.

The molecule ClCCl, also known as dichloromethane, is a simple molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a single carbon atom. It lacks the complexity and aromaticity of the molecules with similar negative property values, but it does share the presence of multiple chlorine atoms.

- Brc1cc(Br)cc(Br)c1, another halogenated aromatic compound, also has a property value of -0.67449076.

Given the structural similarity and the presence of multiple chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict that Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl will have a similar property value. Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is approximately -0.67449076.

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be quite complex, with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and a sugar-like moiety. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Aromatic Rings and Substituents**: The molecule contains aromatic rings with methoxy (OC) and hydroxy (O) groups. These are similar to some of the structures with negative property values, such as nitrobenzene derivatives.

2. **Sugar-like Moiety**: The presence of a sugar-like structure with multiple hydroxyl groups is reminiscent of molecules like OCC1OC(OC2C(O)C(O)C(O)OC2CO)C(O)C(O)C1O, which have positive property values.

3. **Complexity and Size**: The molecule is large and complex, similar to some of the larger structures with positive property values.

Given these observations, the molecule shares characteristics with both positive and negative property value examples. However, the presence of the sugar-like moiety and the overall complexity suggest a positive property value, as seen in other complex molecules with sugar-like structures.

Therefore, based on the patterns observed in the examples, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be positive. A reasonable estimate, considering the complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, would be around 0.85435496, similar to other complex structures with positive values.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.5058680696074463
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of the thiosemicarbazide moiety suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and polar interactions, which could influence the property value. The tert-butyl group is a bulky, non-polar group that can increase hydrophobicity.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar functional groups and structural features tend to have property values that are either slightly positive or negative, depending on the balance between polar and non-polar characteristics.

For instance, the molecule CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a similar tert-butyl group and a heterocyclic structure with nitrogen and sulfur, and it has a property value of 0.64751113. This suggests that the presence of the tert-butyl group and heteroatoms can lead to a positive property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is likely to be positive, similar to the example with the tert-butyl group and heteroatoms. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 0.64751113.

From the examples, molecules with ester groups and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of -0.5028022, and O(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 has a property value of -0.67449076.

Considering these patterns, the predicted property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is likely to be negative. A reasonable estimate, based on the examples, would be around -0.5028022, as it shares similar structural features with the example molecule CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.5028022.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 1.2140833670578712
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The examples suggest that molecules with long carbon chains, especially those with functional groups like alcohols or esters, tend to have positive property values. For instance, CCCCCCCCO has a property value of 1.21408337, and CCCCCCCCOC(=O) has a property value of 1.0042418.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom at the end. Bromine is a halogen, and its presence in aromatic systems tends to result in negative property values, as seen in Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 (-0.67449076). However, in the context of a simple alkyl chain, the effect of bromine might not be as pronounced as in aromatic systems.

Considering the positive property values for long alkyl chains and the potential influence of bromine, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be positive but possibly lower than that of a similar alcohol or ester. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around 1.21408337, similar to other long alkyl chains with simple functional groups.

Predicted property value for CCCCCCCBr: 1.21408337

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide), we can analyze the examples provided and identify patterns or trends in the data. The examples include a variety of organic and inorganic compounds with different functional groups and structural features, each associated with a specific property value.

Carbon monoxide (CO) is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is a small, non-polar molecule with no additional functional groups or complex structures. In the examples, small and simple molecules like CCC (propane) and CCBr (bromoethane) have property values of 1.21408337, which is relatively high compared to more complex or polar molecules that tend to have lower or negative values.

Given the simplicity and non-polar nature of CO, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would be similar to those of other small, non-polar molecules. Therefore, the predicted property value for CO is:

1.21408337
