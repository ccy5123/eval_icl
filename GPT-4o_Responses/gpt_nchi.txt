SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.4683691482210056
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the trends and patterns from the given examples. The molecule in question is a linear ester with a long alkyl chain, specifically a decyl ester.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Linear alkanes and simple alcohols tend to have negative property values, with the magnitude decreasing (becoming less negative) as the chain length increases.
- Esters with longer alkyl chains, such as CCCCCCCC(=O)OC, have positive property values, as seen in the example of CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC with a property value of 0.88928874.

Given that CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is similar to CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC but with one additional carbon in the alkyl chain, we can expect the property value to be slightly higher than 0.88928874 due to the increased chain length.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC would be approximately 0.95.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -0.35655063576705465
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a heterocyclic structure, specifically a chlorinated benzoxazole. The presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in several examples. The heterocyclic structure with an oxygen and nitrogen atom in the ring can also influence the property value, as seen in other heterocyclic examples.

Comparing with similar structures:
- The molecule Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 0.12371328, which is a chlorinated aromatic compound.
- The molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1 has a property value of -0.49201053, which is a chlorinated phenol.
- The molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.73046773, which is a chlorinated biphenyl.

Considering these comparisons, the presence of the heterocyclic structure and the chlorine atom, the property value is likely to be slightly positive but not as high as the fully chlorinated biphenyl. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around 0.1 to 0.3.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value to be approximately:

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: -1.046566314842155
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite. It contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O). The presence of the nitro group is significant because it is an electron-withdrawing group, which generally contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in some of the examples with nitro groups or other electron-withdrawing groups.

For instance, the molecule Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO has a property value of -0.34747893, and it also contains a nitro group. Similarly, NC(=O)CCl, which contains an electron-withdrawing carbonyl and chloro group, has a property value of -1.10124857.

Considering the influence of the nitro group and the relatively small size of the molecule, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O will be negative, likely in the range of the examples with similar electron-withdrawing groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.5.

- CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C, which has a property value of 2.24760288.

The presence of multiple rings and carbonyl groups suggests a relatively high property value, similar to the example above. Given the complexity and the structural similarities, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 2.0. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO is approximately:

- A chlorinated benzene ring (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of -0.55105438.

The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like fluorine and chlorine, along with the amide linkage, suggests a tendency towards a negative property value. The examples with similar features generally have negative values, often in the range of -0.5 to -0.7.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be around -0.6. Therefore, the predicted specific property value is:

It is similar in structure to other small aliphatic ethers and alcohols in the examples, such as CCCCCCO (-0.73286052) and CCCCCC1CCCC1 (0.28093151). The presence of the ether group (C-O-C) and the branching methyl group suggests that the property value might be slightly negative or close to zero, as seen in similar small aliphatic compounds.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC(C)C would be around -0.5. This accounts for the ether functionality and the small size of the molecule, which tends to result in a property value that is not highly positive or negative.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with two carbonyl groups and a bromine atom. The presence of carbonyl groups often contributes to a more negative property value, as seen in several examples like CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (-0.10815806) and CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 (-0.29452359). The presence of a bromine atom can also influence the property, as seen in CCCCCCBr (0.13949633).

Considering these factors, the molecule has structural similarities to those with slightly negative property values due to the carbonyl groups, but the presence of the bromine atom might offset this slightly. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O is likely to be slightly negative, around -0.1 to -0.2.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately -0.15.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of aromatic rings, substituents, and overall molecular complexity.

Biphenyl consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond. In the examples, molecules with multiple aromatic rings and relatively simple structures tend to have property values around or slightly below zero. For instance, the molecule C1CCc2ccccc2C1, which is a cyclohexylbenzene, has a property value of -0.09679946, and the molecule Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C, which is a methylbiphenyl, has a property value of -0.01362838.

Given that biphenyl is a simple structure with two connected phenyl rings and no additional substituents, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be close to zero, similar to the examples with simple aromatic structures.

Therefore, the predicted property value for biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) is approximately:

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: -0.6771073948839633
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the examples provided and look for patterns or similarities. The molecule CCCCCS is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a sulfur atom at the end. This structure is similar to other linear or slightly branched alkanes and alkenes in the examples, which generally have negative property values.

For instance:
- CCCCCCC=C (a linear alkene) has a property value of -0.10136799.
- CCC1CCCCC1 (a cycloalkane) has a property value of -0.13998808.
- CCCCCCC(C)O (a linear alcohol) has a property value of 0.07849132.

The presence of sulfur, which is more electronegative than carbon, might slightly increase the property value compared to a similar hydrocarbon without sulfur. However, given the overall trend of negative values for simple hydrocarbons, the property value for CCCCCS is likely to be slightly negative or close to zero.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be around -0.1.

The presence of the hydroxyl group (OH) typically increases the polarity of the molecule, which can affect the property value.

Considering the examples, the property values for alcohols and similar aliphatic compounds tend to be negative, but the branching and the presence of the hydroxyl group can lead to a less negative or slightly positive value compared to straight-chain alkanes.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO would be around -0.4 to -0.2. Given the examples and the structural similarity to CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O, a specific prediction could be:

For instance, the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C has a property value of -0.20288578.

Considering the structural similarity and the presence of an additional alkyl group, which might slightly increase the property value due to increased hydrophobicity, the predicted property value for O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would likely be slightly higher than -0.20288578.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately -0.15.

The presence of multiple halogens, especially fluorine, which is highly electronegative, can influence the property value.

Considering the electronegative nature of the trifluoromethyl group and its effect on the aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be slightly positive but not as high as those with multiple halogen substitutions. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around 0.1 to 0.3.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 to be approximately 0.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A sulfonamide group (S(=O)(=O)N), which is known to be polar and can contribute to a higher property value.
- An aromatic ring (phenyl group) with an amine substituent, which can also increase the property value due to its electron-donating nature.
- A guanidine group (NC(=N)N), which is basic and can contribute to the property value.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and electron-donating groups (e.g., amines) tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of polar functional groups like sulfonamides can also increase the property value.

Based on these considerations, the predicted property value for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to other molecules with aromatic and polar groups.

- An alkene group (CC(C)=C) attached to the nitrogen, which can slightly increase the property value due to increased hydrophobicity.

Considering these factors, the molecule has both electron-withdrawing groups and hydrophobic groups, which can have opposing effects on the property value. However, the presence of two nitro groups and a trifluoromethyl group suggests a more significant electron-withdrawing effect, which generally decreases the property value.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, I would predict the property value for this molecule to be around -0.5.

For instance, CCC(C)(C)O has a property value of -0.83348875, and CC(C)CCOC=O has a property value of -0.60671347. Both of these molecules contain ester or alcohol functional groups and have negative property values.

Considering the structural similarity of CC(C)OC=O to these examples, particularly CC(C)CCOC=O, which is also an ester, it is reasonable to predict a similar negative property value. Given the simplicity and smaller size of CC(C)OC=O compared to CC(C)CCOC=O, the property value might be slightly less negative.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be approximately -0.65.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.5508872788980608
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the aromatic compounds in the examples.

1. **Aromaticity**: The molecule contains a benzene ring, which is a common feature in several examples. Aromatic compounds tend to have property values around the range of -0.8 to 0.8, depending on the substituents.

2. **Substituents**: The molecule has a hydroxyl group (OH) and two methyl groups (CH3) attached to the benzene ring. The presence of the hydroxyl group, which is an electron-donating group, can influence the property value. In the examples, phenol (c1ccccc1O) has a property value of -0.89661683, and the presence of additional methyl groups can slightly increase the property value due to their electron-donating nature.

3. **Comparison with Examples**: 
   - The molecule c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC has a property value of 0.41312383, which is higher due to the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and a long alkyl chain.
   - The molecule c1ccccc1O has a property value of -0.89661683, which is a simple phenol.
   - The molecule Cc1cccc(N)c1 has a property value of -0.69636351, which is a methyl-substituted aniline.

Considering these factors, the presence of the hydroxyl group and two methyl groups should result in a property value that is slightly higher than that of phenol but not as high as the more complex substituted aromatics with additional electron-donating groups or larger alkyl chains.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be around -0.5.

SMILES: COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1
True Property: 1.7332116780370106
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S) with methoxy groups (OC) and a substituted aromatic ring. The examples with similar phosphorothioate structures are:

1. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, with a property value of 1.60500937
2. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, with a property value of 1.72528751
3. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, with a property value of 1.43031352

These examples have halogen substitutions on the aromatic ring, which tend to increase the property value. The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 has a thiomethyl (SC) and a methyl (C) group instead, which are less electronegative and less polarizing than halogens.

Given the absence of halogens and the presence of less polar groups, we can expect the property value to be lower than those with halogen substitutions. However, the presence of the phosphorothioate group still contributes positively to the property value.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 would be around 1.2.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a chlorinated biphenyl, similar to some of the examples given.

The molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1.13759242, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1.34367315. Both of these molecules are highly chlorinated aromatic compounds, similar to the target molecule.

The target molecule has a similar structure, with multiple chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl system. Given the trend that increased chlorination and aromaticity tend to increase the property value, we can predict that the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl will be in a similar range to the examples provided.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately 1.2.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: -1.0000820098527237
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group attached to the terminal carbon. The presence of the nitro group (N(=O)=O) is a significant factor, as it is an electron-withdrawing group that can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have positive property values, especially when they are attached to aromatic systems or when there are multiple nitro groups. However, in this case, the nitro group is attached to a simple aliphatic chain, which might not have as strong an effect as in aromatic systems.

Considering the examples:
- CCC, a simple aliphatic chain, has a property value of -1.19971127.
- CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, which has multiple nitro groups and a more complex structure, has a property value of 1.11754363.

Given that CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a single nitro group, we can expect the property value to be slightly negative or close to zero, as the nitro group will have some influence but not as much as in more complex or aromatic systems.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around -0.5.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(Br)c1
True Property: -0.5354511716334298
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent. 

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Halogenated benzenes (e.g., Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, COc1cccc(Cl)c1, Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl) tend to have negative property values, with the value becoming less negative as more halogens are added.
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tends to increase the property value, making it less negative or even positive.
- The presence of electron-donating groups like methoxy (OCH3) tends to decrease the property value, making it more negative.

Given that Fc1cccc(Br)c1 has both a fluorine and a bromine substituent, we can compare it to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, which has a property value of -0.37635852. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which might slightly increase the property value (make it less negative) compared to the chlorinated analog.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be slightly less negative than -0.37635852. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.35.

SMILES: CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2
True Property: 0.16812327709161948
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with an additional methyl group and a hydroxyl group. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with bicyclic or polycyclic frameworks and alcohol functionalities.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with complex bicyclic structures and alcohol groups tend to have positive property values, often in the range of 0.5 to 2.5. For instance, the molecule CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO has a property value of 2.47412616, and CC5(C)OC4CC3C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2(F)C(O)CC3(C)C4(O5)C(=O)CO has a property value of 2.91487848.

Given the structural similarity and the presence of a tertiary alcohol, which can contribute to a higher property value, I would predict the property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 to be around 1.5. This is a reasonable estimate considering the structural complexity and the functional groups present in the molecule.

SMILES: CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O
True Property: 1.7883022754994176
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 3.14303423. Both molecules contain a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)), an amide linkage (N-C(=O)), and a phenyl ring (c1ccccc1). The main difference is the absence of the thioether linkage (SC(CCl)) in the molecule to be predicted.

Given the structural similarity, but considering the absence of the thioether linkage, which might contribute to a slightly lower property value, we can estimate the property value to be somewhat lower than 3.14303423.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be approximately 2.8.

SMILES: Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C
True Property: 0.10344670278809313
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is a methylated derivative of a benzamide with an additional phenyl group attached to the nitrogen. This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule CNc1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.67504762, and the molecule O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 0.1098865. Both of these molecules contain aromatic rings and amide or amide-like functionalities.

The presence of the carbonyl group (C=O) and the aromatic rings in Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C suggests that it might have a property value that is slightly positive, as seen in the example O=C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2. However, the additional nitrogen in the heterocyclic ring could influence the property value towards a more negative value, similar to CNc1ccccc1.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around 0.1, as it balances the influence of the aromatic and carbonyl groups with the nitrogen-containing heterocycle.

SMILES: CCCCCC(=O)OCC
True Property: -0.1261656184078501
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ester, specifically an ethyl heptanoate, which is a linear chain with a total of 9 carbon atoms.

Looking at the examples, we can find some similar structures:

1. CCCCCCCC(=O)OC, which is an ester with a similar structure, has a property value of 0.25790935.
2. CCCCCCCI, which is a linear alkane with an iodine atom, has a property value of 0.30959531.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is similar to the first example but with an additional carbon in the ester group, making it slightly larger. The presence of the ester functional group typically increases the property value compared to a simple alkane.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CCCCCCC(=O)OCC would likely be slightly higher than 0.25790935, but not as high as the more complex esters or those with additional functional groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately 0.3.

The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is methyl benzoate, an ester with a benzene ring. In the examples, we have a similar structure:

- CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of -0.29452359.

The difference between the two molecules is the presence of an additional ethyl group in the example, which might slightly affect the property value. However, the core structure is the same, and the property value is likely to be close to that of the example.

Considering this, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -0.29.

True Property: -1.1076226535009166
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear conjugated diene, which is a relatively simple hydrocarbon structure. 

Looking at the examples, simple hydrocarbons and small molecules with limited functional groups tend to have negative property values. For instance, CC/C=C/C has a property value of -0.9421821, and CCC(C)(C)CC has a property value of -0.48115659. These examples suggest that small hydrocarbons without significant polar or functional groups tend to have negative property values.

Given the structure of C=CCC=C, which is similar in simplicity to the examples mentioned, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Considering the trend and the nature of the molecule, a predicted property value for C=CCC=C could be approximately -0.8.

To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their properties. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups, halogens, and the overall complexity of the molecule.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is a simple compound with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. This structure is similar to other halogenated compounds in the examples, such as FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br, which has a property value of -0.68199896. The presence of multiple bromine atoms, which are heavy and electronegative, likely contributes to a negative property value.

Considering the simplicity of BrC(Br)Br compared to more complex structures in the examples, and the presence of multiple bromine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Given the trend observed in the examples, a plausible prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br is approximately -0.7.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S), which is similar to the phosphorothioate group in COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 2.78058575.
- An amide linkage (N-C=O) within a cyclic structure, similar to the amide linkage in CC1(C)CON(Cc2ccccc2Cl)C1=O, which has a property value of 0.54811448.
- A chlorinated carbon (CCl), which is a feature in several molecules with varying property values, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (-0.1414113) and OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (1.34132186).

Considering these features, the presence of the phosphorothioate group suggests a relatively high property value, as seen in the example with a similar group. The cyclic amide structure and chlorinated carbon may moderate this value.

Taking into account the structural similarities and the property values of the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O would be around 2.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A tertiary amide group (CN(C)C(=O)N), similar to CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, which has a property value of -0.7678568.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a property value of -0.54187477.
- A heterocyclic ring with nitrogen and oxygen, similar to Nc1cc(nc(N)n1=O)N2CCCCC2, which has a property value of 0.34655817.
- A tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C), which is a bulky hydrophobic group.

Considering these features, the molecule has a mix of polar and non-polar characteristics, with some electron-withdrawing groups (chlorine and carbonyl) and a bulky hydrophobic group. The presence of the amide and the heterocyclic ring suggests some degree of polarity and potential for hydrogen bonding, which might increase the property value compared to simpler chlorinated aromatics.

Balancing these factors, the predicted property value for CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C is likely to be slightly positive, reflecting the balance between polar and non-polar features, and the influence of the bulky tert-butyl group.

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a dichlorinated biphenyl ether, which has two phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, with three chlorine atoms attached to the rings. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 0.32586144. The presence of additional chlorine atoms and the ether linkage in the target molecule could influence the property value.

Considering the examples, the presence of chlorine atoms generally tends to increase the property value, as seen in the examples with chlorinated aromatic compounds. The ether linkage might also contribute to a higher property value compared to a simple biphenyl structure.

Taking these factors into account, I would predict that the property value for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is slightly higher than 0.32586144, due to the additional chlorine and ether linkage. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately:

In the examples, the molecule CC/C=C/C, which is a similar linear alkene (2-butene with a different stereochemistry), has a property value of -0.9421821. Given the structural similarity and the fact that stereochemistry might not significantly affect the property in this context, we can predict that the property value for CC/C=C\C will be very close to that of CC/C=C/C.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C is approximately -0.9421821.

For instance, CCC(O)CC has a property value of -0.7473509, and CCOC(=O)C has a property value of -0.63329717. These examples suggest that the presence of an ether group in a relatively simple aliphatic chain contributes to a negative property value.

Given this pattern, we can predict that the property value for CCCOCC will also be negative. Considering the simplicity of the molecule compared to the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value of CCCOCC would be around -0.6.

To predict the property value for the molecule CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

This molecule is a tertiary amide with two phenyl rings and a tert-butyl group. The presence of aromatic rings and the amide functional group suggests that the property value might be positive, as seen in similar structures in the examples.

Comparing with similar structures:
- CN(C(=O)COc1nc2ccccc2s1)c3ccccc3 has a property value of 1.30083849.
- CN(C)C(=O)NC1CC2CC1C3CCCC23 has a property value of 1.00146364.

Both of these molecules have amide groups and aromatic rings, similar to the target molecule. The tert-butyl group in the target molecule might slightly increase the property value due to its electron-donating nature and steric effects.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C(=O)NC(C)(C)c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be around 1.1.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 contains:
- An acetamide group (CC(=O)N-), which is a common feature in several molecules with moderate property values.
- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1), which is present in some examples with slightly negative property values.

Looking at the examples:
- Molecules with acetamide groups, such as CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, have positive property values.
- Molecules with bromobenzene, such as Fc1cccc(Br)c1 and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1, have negative property values.

Considering these observations, the presence of both an acetamide group and a bromobenzene moiety suggests a balance between the positive influence of the acetamide and the negative influence of the bromobenzene. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to be slightly negative, but close to zero.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is approximately -0.5.

Looking at the examples, we can find similar structures:

1. CCc1ccc(C)cc1: This is ethylbenzene, with a property value of -0.37141989.
2. CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1: This is a similar structure to cumene, with an additional methyl group on the benzene ring, and has a property value of -0.21032744.

Cumene is structurally between these two examples, as it has an isopropyl group attached to the benzene ring, similar to the second example but without the additional methyl group on the benzene ring.

Given these comparisons, the property value for cumene (CC(C)Cc1ccccc1) is likely to be close to the values of these similar structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of cumene would be around -0.3.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:

1. Molecules with aromatic rings and electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro groups) tend to have negative property values.
2. Molecules with multiple aromatic rings or complex structures with multiple functional groups often have positive property values.
3. Simple aliphatic or small aromatic compounds without strong electron-withdrawing or donating groups tend to have negative property values.

Benzaldehyde has a single aromatic ring with an aldehyde group, which is a mild electron-withdrawing group. This structure is somewhat similar to simpler aromatic compounds with electron-withdrawing groups, which tend to have negative property values.

Based on these observations, I would predict that the property value for benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) is likely to be negative, but not as negative as those with stronger electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups.

A reasonable prediction for the property value of O=Cc1ccccc1 would be around -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring, similar to some of the examples. The presence of the nitro group (N(=O)=O) and the aromatic ring (c1ccc(o1)) suggests that the molecule might have a property value in the range of those with similar functional groups.

Looking at the examples, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings, such as Clc2ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 (0.60017641) and COc2ccc(Oc1ccc(NC(=O)N(C)C)cc1)cc2 (0.93489812), tend to have positive property values. Additionally, the presence of a heterocyclic structure with carbonyl groups (O=C) might contribute to a moderate positive value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 is likely to be positive and in the range of 0.5 to 1.0. A reasonable estimate would be around 0.65.

To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a diarylamine, where two phenyl rings are connected through a nitrogen atom. 

Looking at the examples, we have a similar structure: N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of 0.08593173. The difference between the two structures is that the example has an azo group (N=N) connecting the phenyl rings, while the target molecule has an amine group (N-N).

The presence of the azo group in the example might slightly increase the property value due to its potential for resonance and electron delocalization. In contrast, the amine linkage in the target molecule might not contribute as much to these effects, potentially leading to a slightly lower property value.

Considering these structural differences and their potential impact on the property, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be slightly lower than 0.08593173. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.05.

Considering the structural similarities and the property values of similar compounds, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 would be around 0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, tend to have higher property values (1.29603875).
- Simple chlorinated aromatic compounds like Clc1ccccc1Cl have negative property values (-0.54853599).
- The presence of additional aromatic rings or complex structures tends to increase the property value.

Given that Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a more complex structure with multiple chlorine atoms compared to Clc1ccccc1Cl, it is reasonable to predict a higher property value than -0.54853599. However, it is likely to be lower than the highly chlorinated and more complex structure with a value of 1.29603875.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:

1. Aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions tend to have negative property values, such as Cc1ccccc1N (-0.69384513) and CCc1ccccn1 (-0.60329876).
2. The presence of additional alkyl groups generally increases the property value slightly, but not significantly enough to make it positive in the case of simple aromatic compounds.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, which is diethylbenzene, would likely be slightly negative, similar to the other alkyl-substituted aromatic compounds.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is approximately -0.65.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is a para-substituted aniline with a sulfonamide group. The presence of the sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is a key feature that can influence the property value. In the examples, nitro groups (N(=O)=O) and sulfonamide groups tend to have a significant impact on the property values, often making them more negative.

For instance, the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -0.65900473, which is quite negative due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the nitro group. Similarly, other molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro or sulfonamide tend to have negative property values.

Given the structural similarity of the sulfonamide group to the nitro group in terms of electron-withdrawing effects, we can expect the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O to be in a similar negative range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be approximately -0.65.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)O)
- An amide linkage (NC(C)=O)
- A thioether linkage (SC)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, tend to have positive property values (1.43031352).
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1, have slightly negative property values (-0.28285391).
- Molecules with thioether linkages, such as CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, have high positive property values (3.29001308).

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values, the presence of the phosphorothioate and thioether groups suggests a positive contribution, while the amide linkage might slightly reduce the overall value.

Based on this analysis, the predicted property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is likely to be positive, but not as high as the example with multiple thioether linkages. A reasonable estimate would be around 1.2.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular structure.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, symmetrical molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. In the examples, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly chlorine, tend to have positive property values, especially when they are part of aromatic or complex structures. However, smaller and simpler molecules with halogens, such as chlorinated alkanes, tend to have negative or slightly positive values.

Considering the simplicity and symmetry of Cl\C=C/Cl, along with the presence of two chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly positive but close to zero, reflecting the balance between the electronegative chlorine atoms and the small size of the molecule.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl is approximately 0.05.

- The presence of chlorine in aromatic rings, as seen in Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl (0.93403008), can also contribute to a positive property value.
- The presence of an ester linkage, as in CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC (0.36661349), is associated with positive property values.

Considering these observations, the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 has structural features that are similar to those in molecules with positive property values. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value for this molecule.

Based on the structural analysis and comparison with the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 is approximately 0.35.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Linear alkanes and simple alcohols tend to have negative property values. For instance, OC1CCCCCCC1 has a property value of -0.07986232, and CCCCCC has a property value of -0.33382487.
- The presence of a hydroxyl group (as in alcohols) seems to slightly increase the property value compared to alkanes of similar size.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a sulfonamide with a cyclic structure, containing a benzene ring, a sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)), and an amide linkage (C(=O)N). These features are similar to some of the molecules in the examples, particularly those with aromatic rings and sulfonyl or carbonyl groups.

From the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and sulfonyl or carbonyl groups tend to have positive property values, especially when they are part of a larger, more complex structure. For instance, the molecule CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C has a property value of 2.38420971, and it contains both aromatic and sulfonyl features.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of both aromatic and sulfonyl groups, the predicted property value for CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to those of other complex aromatic sulfonamides.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is:

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:

1. **Aromatic Ring**: The presence of a benzene ring (c2ccccc2) is a common feature in many of the examples, often contributing to a slightly positive or negative property value depending on additional substituents.

2. **Nitro Group (N(=O)=O)**: The nitro group is known to be an electron-withdrawing group, which can influence the property value towards the negative side. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups tend to have negative property values.

3. **Ester Groups (COC(=O))**: The presence of ester groups can contribute to a more positive property value due to their electron-withdrawing nature and potential for hydrogen bonding.

4. **Heterocyclic Ring with Nitrogen (C1=C(C)NC)**: The presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle can influence the property value, often depending on the specific context and other substituents.

5. **Methyl Groups (C)**: Methyl groups are generally electron-donating, which can slightly increase the property value.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, the molecule has a mix of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating groups. The presence of the nitro group and ester groups suggests a tendency towards a more positive property value, but the overall influence of the aromatic system and the heterocyclic nitrogen must also be considered.

Based on the examples, molecules with similar complexity and functional groups tend to have property values in the range of slightly negative to moderately positive. Given the balance of electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be slightly positive.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C is approximately:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two carbonyl groups (C=O) and two nitrogen atoms in a six-membered ring. This structure is relatively polar due to the presence of carbonyl groups and nitrogen atoms, which can engage in hydrogen bonding and dipole interactions.

Looking at the examples, molecules with polar functional groups like carbonyls and amides tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of -0.0227113, and OCc1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.7088133. These examples suggest that the presence of carbonyl and amide groups contributes to a negative property value.

Considering the structure of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 and its similarity to other polar molecules in the examples, I would predict a negative property value. Given the examples and the nature of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include a variety of molecular structures with different functional groups and sizes, and their property values range from negative to positive.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure, consisting of a chloroethane group. In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules, especially those with halogen atoms, tend to have negative property values. For instance, Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) has a property value of -0.75209833, and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (hexachlorobenzene) has a property value of -0.1414113. These examples suggest that the presence of chlorine in a relatively simple structure often results in a negative property value.

Given the simplicity of ClCC and the presence of a chlorine atom, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Considering the trend observed in the examples, a value around -0.8 to -1.0 seems plausible for ClCC.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCC is approximately -0.9.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have positive property values, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (0.52690539) and Clc1ccccc1c2ccccc2 (0.12229909).
- The presence of a trichloromethyl group, as seen in Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl (1.29603875), also contributes to a positive property value.

Considering these observations, the presence of both a pyridine ring and a trichloromethyl group, along with the additional chlorine atom, suggests that the property value for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is likely to be positive and somewhat similar to the examples with multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl would be approximately 0.5.

The molecule CCCCC(C)O is a primary alcohol with a six-carbon chain, also known as 2-hexanol. In the examples, similar alcohols and alkanes have been given property values. For instance:

- CCCCCCCCl (a seven-carbon chain with a chlorine atom) has a property value of -0.10756092.
- CCCCC(O)CCC (a seven-carbon chain with an alcohol group) has a property value of -0.32643131.
- CCC(C)CCO (a five-carbon chain with an alcohol group) has a property value of -0.56708267.

Considering these examples, the presence of the alcohol group generally contributes to a negative property value, and the length of the carbon chain also influences the value. Given that CCCCC(C)O is a six-carbon alcohol, its property value is likely to be between those of CCC(C)CCO and CCCCC(O)CCC.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCC(C)O would be approximately -0.45.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Simple aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have negative property values. For instance:
   - ClCCl (dichloromethane) has a property value of -1.12000851.
   - ClC(Cl)Cl (chloroform) has a property value of -0.9683118.
   - ClC(=C)Cl (1,1-dichloroethylene) has a property value of -1.16888596.

2. The presence of multiple halogen atoms generally results in more negative property values, as seen with:
   - ClC(Cl)C(Cl)Cl (carbon tetrachloride) with a property value of -0.55244872.

3. The presence of a benzene ring with halogen substituents, such as in Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O, results in a positive property value of 1.07510006, but this is due to additional functional groups that contribute to the overall property.

Given that 1,4-dibromobenzene is a simple aromatic compound with two bromine atoms, we can expect its property value to be negative, similar to other halogenated aromatics. However, the presence of the benzene ring might slightly mitigate the negativity compared to aliphatic halogenated compounds.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around -0.8. This accounts for the negative influence of the bromine atoms while considering the stabilizing effect of the aromatic ring.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with multiple halogens, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of a trifluoromethyl group, as seen in CC(=O)Nc1cc(NS(=O)(=O)C(F)(F)F)c(C)cc1C, also suggests a higher property value.

The presence of the methoxy group (electron-donating) and the nitro group (electron-withdrawing) in COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O suggests a balance between these effects. The nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group, which might dominate the overall electronic effect.

Considering these factors and the examples, the property value for COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O is likely to be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the nitro group. A reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.5.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 0.70019704. The given molecule has even more chlorine atoms and a more complex structure, which could potentially increase the property value due to increased molecular weight and potential for higher electron-withdrawing effects.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl is likely to be higher than 0.70019704. A reasonable estimate, taking into account the increased complexity and chlorination, would be around 0.85.

SMILES: CCCOC=O
True Property: -0.9669541574898656
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. Esters generally have moderate to low property values, often negative, due to their polar nature and the presence of the carbonyl group.

Looking at the examples, simple aliphatic compounds like CCC#C and CCCCC#C have negative property values, while more complex structures with additional functional groups or aromatic rings tend to have higher or positive values. The presence of the ester functional group (COC=O) in CCCOC=O suggests a property value that is likely negative but not as low as highly polar or charged molecules.

Considering the examples and the nature of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be around -0.5. This value reflects the moderate polarity and the lack of additional complex functional groups or aromatic systems that would significantly increase the property value.

True Property: 0.7156735606133096
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a long-chain ester, specifically a decanoate ester, which is similar to other aliphatic esters and long-chain hydrocarbons in the examples.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Long-chain hydrocarbons and esters tend to have property values around or slightly below zero.
- For instance, CCCCC(CC)C=O has a property value of -0.19559405, and CCCC=C(CC)C=O has a property value of -0.32636449.
- The presence of an ester group (as in CCOC(=O)CCN...) can slightly increase the property value compared to a simple alkane.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is likely to be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the ester group and the long hydrocarbon chain. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.2 to -0.3.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately -0.25.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is known to be electron-withdrawing and can contribute to a more positive property value.
- Two chlorine atoms, which are also electron-withdrawing and can similarly affect the property value.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N), which can contribute to a more positive property value due to its polar nature.
- Two aromatic rings, which can contribute to a more negative property value due to their hydrophobic nature.

Comparing with the examples:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.54187477.
- Molecules with chlorine atoms, such as COc1ccc(Cl)cc1, have a property value of -0.5319338.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, have a property value of -0.67807854.

Considering these factors, the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O is likely to have a property value that is slightly negative, influenced by the electron-withdrawing groups and the presence of aromatic rings.

Based on the analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately -0.45.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- Two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are similar to the phosphorothioate group in the molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 2.78058575.
- Aromatic rings with substituents, similar to other aromatic compounds in the examples, such as Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl with a property value of 0.72794935.
- The presence of sulfur atoms, which can influence the property value, as seen in other sulfur-containing compounds like CC(=O)N(S(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1)c2onc(C)c2C with a property value of 1.16483257.

Given the presence of two phosphorothioate groups and aromatic rings, the molecule is likely to have a relatively high property value. The examples with similar features tend to have property values above 1.0.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 would be around 2.5.

True Property: -0.6863932628115047
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) with a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.56753556.
- Molecules with phenol groups, such as Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, have a property value of -0.28844818.

The presence of both a nitro group and a phenol group suggests that the property value might be influenced by both functional groups. The nitro group is electron-withdrawing, which can increase the acidity of the phenol, potentially affecting the property value.

Considering these factors, the property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is likely to be similar to or slightly more negative than the value for Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O due to the additional electron-withdrawing effect of the nitro group on the phenol.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is approximately -0.6.

True Property: 2.650527271930838
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a complex sugar, likely a polysaccharide or oligosaccharide, given the multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic acetal structures.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic structures, such as sugars, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, which is a simple sugar, has a property value of -0.54677757.

Given the complexity and the number of hydroxyl groups in the provided molecule, it is reasonable to predict a similar or slightly more negative property value due to the increased number of hydroxyl groups and the overall structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the molecule OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O would be approximately -0.6.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: -1.2270198015913538
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne. It has a terminal alkyne group (C#C) and a relatively small carbon chain. In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules with unsaturated bonds, such as nitriles (N#C) and simple aromatic compounds, tend to have negative property values. For instance, N#Cc1ccccc1C#N has a property value of -0.62711318, and CCC(C)C(=O)C has a value of -0.66459996.

Given the simplicity and the presence of the alkyne group, which is somewhat similar to the nitrile group in terms of unsaturation and electronegativity effects, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for CCC#C. Considering the trend in the examples, a value around -0.6 to -0.7 seems plausible.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C is approximately:

1. **Phosphorothioate Group**: The presence of a phosphorothioate group (P=S) is similar to the molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 2.78058575. This suggests that the phosphorothioate group contributes significantly to increasing the property value.

2. **Chlorinated Aromatic Ring**: The molecule contains a chlorinated aromatic ring, similar to Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (0.52690539) and Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl (0.65004066). Chlorine atoms on aromatic rings generally increase the property value.

3. **Ether Linkage**: The presence of an ether linkage (O-C) is also seen in the molecule CCOC(=O)CC(SP(=S)(OC)OC)C(=O)OCC, which has a high property value of 2.31484418. This suggests that ether linkages can contribute positively to the property value.

Considering these structural features and their contributions to the property values in the examples, the predicted property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be relatively high. A reasonable estimate, taking into account the contributions from the phosphorothioate group, chlorinated aromatic ring, and ether linkage, would be around:

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is a pyridine ring with a carbonyl group (C=O) and a hydrazine group (NN) attached. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2, which has a pyrimidine ring with carbonyl and amine groups, and has a property value of -0.54885167. Another similar structure is Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, which has a nitro group attached to an aromatic ring, with a property value of -0.65900473.

Considering the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl group and the potential electron-donating effect of the hydrazine group, the property value is likely to be slightly negative, reflecting the balance between these effects.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be around -0.55.

   - It also contains an amide linkage (C(=O)N), which is present in several molecules with varying property values.
   - The presence of a piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1) is a feature that can influence the property, similar to other cyclic amines.

2. **Comparison with Similar Structures:**
   - The molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1 has a similar phosphorothioate group and a high property value, suggesting that the phosphorothioate group contributes positively to the property.
   - The presence of an amide linkage and a cyclic amine (piperidine) might moderate the property value, as seen in other examples with amide linkages.

3. **Overall Prediction:**
   - Considering the positive contribution of the phosphorothioate group and the moderating effect of the amide and cyclic amine, the property value is likely to be positive but not as high as the example with the nitro group.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be approximately **0.9**.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: -0.14741229893186997
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC (n-octane), we can analyze the trends from the given examples. The examples suggest that alkanes and simple hydrocarbons tend to have negative property values, with the magnitude of the value generally increasing (becoming more negative) with the length of the carbon chain.

For instance:
- CCC(O)CC has a property value of -0.7473509.
- C/C1CCCCC1\C has a property value of -0.19358007.
- CCCCCCCCO has a property value of -0.31194093.

Given that CCCCCCCC is a straight-chain alkane with eight carbon atoms, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be negative and likely more negative than the shorter alkanes listed above.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCC (n-octane) would be approximately -0.4 to -0.5. However, to provide a specific value, I would predict:

SMILES: CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C
True Property: 1.9949330196741304
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a molecule based on its structure involves considering various factors such as the presence of functional groups, the degree of saturation, aromaticity, and steric effects. The examples provided suggest that the property values are influenced by these structural features.

The molecule in question, CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, contains several notable features:
- It has a polycyclic structure with multiple rings, similar to some of the examples with higher property values.
- There is a ketone group (C=O) and an alcohol group (O), which can contribute to the property value.
- The presence of a triple bond (C#C) might also influence the property value.

Based on the examples, molecules with complex polycyclic structures and functional groups like ketones and alcohols tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO has a property value of 2.47412616, and it shares some structural similarities with the given molecule.

Considering these factors, I would predict that the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is likely to be relatively high, possibly around 2.0 to 2.5. However, without a precise model or additional context, this prediction is an estimation based on structural similarities.

True Property: 4.004088411925497
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like the one you've provided involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples given. The molecule in question, COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67, appears to be a polycyclic compound with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as methoxy and hydroxyl groups.

From the examples provided, it seems that the property values are influenced by the presence of aromatic rings, heteroatoms (such as oxygen, nitrogen, and halogens), and the overall complexity of the molecular structure. Molecules with more aromatic rings and heteroatoms tend to have higher property values, while simpler aliphatic compounds or those with fewer heteroatoms tend to have lower values.

Given the complexity of the molecule in question, with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and hydroxyl groups, it is likely to have a relatively high property value. Comparing it to similar complex structures in the examples, such as the large polycyclic compounds with multiple functional groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around 2.5. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 is approximately 2.5.

True Property: -0.6930544818997161
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the electronic and steric effects of the substituents on the aromatic ring.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to the given examples of phenol derivatives and chlorinated aromatic compounds. For instance:

- Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (nitrophenol) has a property value of -0.68639326.
- Oc1ccccc1N(=O)=O (another nitrophenol) has a property value of -0.68387487.
- Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) has a property value of -0.91119098.
- Clc1ccccc1I (iodochlorobenzene) has a property value of -0.25356199.

The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) generally contributes to a more negative property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature through resonance, while the chlorine atom (Cl) can have a variable effect depending on its position and the overall electronic environment.

Considering these factors, the property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is likely to be negative, similar to other phenol derivatives. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be around -0.7, considering the influence of both the hydroxyl and chlorine substituents.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl is approximately -0.7.

The molecule contains:
- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C), which is a linear and polarizable group.
- An ester linkage (OC(=O)), which is polar and can contribute to the overall polarity of the molecule.
- An amide group (NC(=O)), which is also polar and can contribute to hydrogen bonding.
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1), which is similar to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with chlorinated aromatic rings tend to have positive property values, such as Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl (1.34367315) and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl (1.13759242).
- Molecules with ester and amide groups can have varying property values depending on the overall structure, but they often contribute to a more positive value compared to simple hydrocarbons.

Considering these factors, the presence of multiple polar groups and the chlorinated aromatic ring suggests that the property value is likely to be positive, but not as high as the highly chlorinated aromatic examples. A reasonable prediction, considering the balance of polar and non-polar features, would be around 0.5.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 is approximately 0.5.

The molecule in question has:
- A phenol group (OC) attached to a phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.
- A pyrimidine ring (c2cncnc2) attached to the central carbon.
- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have positive property values.
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups like chlorine often increases the property value.
- The presence of heterocycles like pyrimidine can also influence the property value positively.

Considering these factors, the molecule has similarities with examples that have positive property values, such as:
- Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl, which has a property value of 1.29603875.
- ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O, which has a property value of 1.07896423.

The molecule CCCCCOC=O is an ester, specifically a linear alkyl ester, similar to the example molecule CCCCCCC=O, which has a property value of -0.59491558. The presence of the ester functional group (OC=O) and the linear alkyl chain are key features that influence the property value.

Considering the examples, linear alkyl chains and ester groups tend to have negative property values. The molecule CCCCCOC=O is structurally similar to CCCCCCC=O, but with a shorter alkyl chain, which might slightly affect the property value.

Based on this analysis, I predict the property value for CCCCCOC=O to be approximately -0.55.

To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we can look at the examples provided and identify patterns or trends in the data. The molecule ClCCl is similar to ClCCCl, which has a property value of -0.90954872. Given that ClCCl is a smaller and simpler molecule than ClCCCl, it is reasonable to predict that its property value might be slightly more negative due to its reduced complexity and potential differences in molecular interactions.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be approximately -0.95.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methylphenol, specifically a cresol, which is a type of aromatic alcohol. 

Looking at the examples, we have:
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, with a property value of -0.15128359. This is a similar structure, being a methylated phenol.
- Oc1cccc(O)c1, with a property value of -0.84009137. This is a dihydroxybenzene, which is more polar due to the additional hydroxyl group.

The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is less polar than Oc1cccc(O)c1 due to having only one hydroxyl group, and it is similar to CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, but with one less methyl group. The presence of the hydroxyl group will contribute to a negative property value, but the methyl groups will slightly offset this due to their hydrophobic nature.

Considering these factors, the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is likely to be slightly more negative than -0.15128359 but not as negative as -0.84009137. A reasonable prediction would be around -0.2 to -0.3.

To predict the property value for the molecule "Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl", we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a dichlorinated biphenyl, similar to the example "Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl" which has a property value of 1.13759242. The given molecule has four chlorine atoms, similar to the example, but with a slightly different arrangement.

Considering the structural similarity and the presence of multiple chlorine atoms, which tend to increase the property value, we can predict that the property value for this molecule will be close to the example with four chlorines. However, since the arrangement is slightly different, it might be slightly lower than 1.13759242.

True Property: -1.0095348178854373
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple hydrocarbon with a branched structure and a double bond. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons and those with similar structural features tend to have property values around zero, often slightly negative or positive depending on the presence of functional groups or additional complexity.

For instance:
- CCCCCCCC (octane) has a property value of -0.1474123.
- CCCCCCCC=C (1-nonene) has a property value of 0.10909181.

Given that isoprene is a small, branched hydrocarbon with a double bond, it is reasonable to predict a property value close to these examples. Considering the slight increase in complexity due to the double bond and branching, a small positive value might be expected.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C is approximately 0.1.

To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane), we can analyze the trends in the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular size and complexity.

In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms tend to have positive property values, especially when the chlorine atoms are part of a larger, more complex structure. However, smaller and simpler molecules with chlorine, such as ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl, have negative property values.

Given that ClCCl is a small and simple molecule with two chlorine atoms, it is likely to have a negative property value. Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around -0.7.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: -0.2859297943322667
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol. In the examples, we have a similar structure: Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which is 2,4,5-trichlorophenol, with a property value of -0.28844818.

The difference between the two molecules is the position of the chlorine atoms on the phenol ring. However, both molecules have three chlorine atoms and a hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring, which suggests that their electronic and steric properties are quite similar.

Given this similarity, we can predict that the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl will be close to that of Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl. Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is approximately -0.288.

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: 4.004088411925497
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known molecules.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups. The presence of these features suggests that the molecule might have a relatively high property value, similar to other complex polycyclic and oxygen-rich structures in the examples.

Given the examples, molecules with high complexity, multiple rings, and oxygen functionalities tend to have higher property values. For instance, molecules like O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (2.20402422) and CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1(O)C(=O)CO (2.39613488) have high property values due to their structural complexity and functional groups.

Considering these factors, I would predict that the property value for the given molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 is likely to be in the higher range, similar to the more complex examples provided.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately **1.8**.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: 0.4754030430300521
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains:
- A thioether group (CS-)
- A pyrazole ring (1,2,4-triazole-like structure)
- A carbonyl group (C=O)
- A tertiary butyl group (C(C)(C)C)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and carbonyl groups tend to have positive property values.
- Molecules with halogens or simple aliphatic chains tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of heteroatoms like nitrogen and sulfur can influence the property value, often making it more positive.

Considering these factors, the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C has a combination of features that suggest a moderately positive property value. The presence of the pyrazole ring and the carbonyl group, along with the tertiary butyl group, likely contributes to a positive value, while the sulfur atom might slightly reduce it.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C would be around 0.8.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -0.2945235917532981
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is an ethyl benzoate, which consists of an ester group (CCOC(=O)) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1).

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with ester groups and aromatic rings tend to have property values around the range of -0.3 to 0.3. For instance, CCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of -0.37347003, and CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 has a property value of 2.1188706, but this latter molecule is more complex with additional functional groups that likely increase its property value.

Given that CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is a relatively simple ester with a single aromatic ring, it is reasonable to predict a property value closer to the lower end of the range observed for similar structures. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around -0.1.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.13949632952630053
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and shape of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached. In the examples, we have a similar molecule, Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which has a property value of 0.0138635. This molecule is an aromatic compound with a bromine atom, and its property value is slightly positive.

Another relevant example is CCCCCCCCO, which is a linear alkyl chain with an alcohol group, and it has a property value of -0.31194093. The presence of the alcohol group likely contributes to the negative value.

Considering the structure of CCCCCCCBr, it is a simple linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom. The bromine atom is less polarizing than an alcohol group, and the molecule is relatively non-polar. Based on the examples, the property value for CCCCCCCBr is likely to be slightly negative or close to zero, as it is similar to other linear alkyl chains without strongly polar functional groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr is around -0.2.

SMILES: CO
True Property: -1.6067405018213043
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide), we can analyze the examples provided. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting a physicochemical property such as solubility, partition coefficient, or electronic property.

Carbon monoxide is a small, simple diatomic molecule. In the examples, small and simple molecules like CCC (propane) and CC#C (propyne) have negative property values, indicating that smaller, less complex molecules tend to have lower values.

Given that CO is even smaller and simpler than the smallest examples provided, it is reasonable to predict that its property value would be negative and possibly lower than those of the small hydrocarbons.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO would be around -1.5, considering the trend of decreasing values with decreasing molecular complexity and size.
