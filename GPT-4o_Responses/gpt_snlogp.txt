SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 0.25557195236706853
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends in the data. The molecule in question is a long-chain ester, specifically a decanoate ester.

From the examples, we observe that:

1. Long-chain hydrocarbons (e.g., CCCCCCC, CCCCCCCC(C)O) tend to have positive property values.
2. Esters (e.g., COC(=O)c1cccnc1, CCOC(=O)CC) have varying property values, but they are generally closer to zero or slightly positive.
3. The presence of an ester group (C(=O)OC) in a long-chain molecule might slightly reduce the positive property value compared to a pure hydrocarbon chain.

Given these observations, the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is expected to have a property value that is positive but not as high as a pure hydrocarbon chain of similar length. It should be closer to the property value of other esters with long chains.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is approximately 0.5.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: 0.6232492109120059
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a lactam (cyclic amide) structure. It resembles some of the other aromatic compounds in the examples, particularly those with heteroatoms and halogen substitutions.

1. **Aromatic and Heteroatom Influence**: The presence of an aromatic ring with a heteroatom (oxygen in the lactam) is similar to some of the examples, such as c1cncnc1 (-0.20373036) and Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (-0.19466321). These examples have negative property values.

2. **Halogen Substitution**: The presence of chlorine atoms in the aromatic ring is a common feature in several examples, such as Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl (-0.33056791) and Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl (-0.19466321). These examples also have negative property values.

3. **Lactam Structure**: The lactam group (cyclic amide) is present in some examples like O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC (-1.01924452) and O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)C)CC=C(C)C (-0.48383077), which also have negative property values.

Considering these factors, the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is likely to have a negative property value due to the combination of aromaticity, halogen substitution, and the presence of a lactam group.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 would be around -0.25.

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 0.8764344639668528
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite, which contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O). In the examples, molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, tend to have negative property values. The presence of the nitro group, which is electron-withdrawing, often contributes to a lower property value.

Additionally, the examples show that simple aliphatic chains or small alkyl groups without significant electron-withdrawing groups tend to have positive property values, but the presence of a nitro group can significantly lower this value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC(C)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative, similar to other nitro-containing compounds in the examples. A reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.3, given the influence of the nitro group.

SMILES: CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO
True Property: 0.7450523719893234
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples. The molecule in question appears to be a polycyclic compound with multiple rings and carbonyl groups, similar to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we can observe that polycyclic compounds with carbonyl groups tend to have negative property values, such as:

- c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54, -0.58684864
- CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C, -0.5947597

Given the structural complexity and the presence of carbonyl groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO will also be negative and likely in a similar range to the examples above.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately -0.60.

SMILES: Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2
True Property: 0.765328117607724
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A fluorinated benzene ring (Fc1cccc(F)c1), which is similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 with a property value of 0.55687267.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N), which is a common feature in several molecules with varying property values.
- A chlorinated benzene ring (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), which is similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of -0.99291022.

The presence of both electron-withdrawing groups (fluorine and chlorine) and the amide linkage suggests a balance between electron-withdrawing and electron-donating effects. The examples show that molecules with halogens and amide linkages can have both positive and negative property values, depending on the specific structure and substitution pattern.

Considering the examples and the structural features, the predicted property value for Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 is likely to be slightly negative, as the electron-withdrawing effects might dominate due to the presence of both fluorine and chlorine.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately -0.200.

True Property: 0.35529381082667993
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with an alkyl chain. It is similar to other small aliphatic ethers and alcohols in the examples, such as CCCCCCO (-1.00870538) and CCCCCCCBr (-0.20078573). These molecules tend to have negative property values, likely due to their non-polar, hydrophobic nature and lack of significant functional groups that might contribute to a positive property value.

Given the structure of CCCOC(C)C, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly negative, reflecting its similarity to other small ethers and alcohols in the dataset.

Therefore, a reasonable predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C would be approximately -0.15.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a substituted pyrrole with two carbonyl groups and a bromine atom. Let's consider the following:

1. **Presence of Carbonyl Groups**: Carbonyl groups (C=O) are polar and can contribute to a more negative property value. In the examples, molecules with carbonyl groups, such as O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)CC (-0.73397861) and CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 (0.41709061), show varying effects depending on the overall structure.

2. **Halogen Substitution**: The presence of a bromine atom can influence the property value. In the examples, halogenated aromatic compounds like Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 (-0.99291022) and Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl (0.42418091) show that halogens can have both positive and negative effects.

3. **Aromatic and Heterocyclic Structure**: The molecule has an aromatic heterocyclic structure, which can affect the property value. In the examples, heterocyclic compounds like Nc1nccs1 (0.95887625) and COc2cnc1cncnc1n2 (-0.5100095) show diverse property values.

4. **Alkyl Substitution**: The presence of alkyl groups (e.g., CCC(C)-) can contribute to a more positive property value, as seen in examples like CCC(C)CC (0.61382628).

Considering these factors, the molecule CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O has a combination of polar carbonyl groups, a bromine atom, and an alkyl chain. The overall effect is likely to be a balance between the negative influence of the carbonyl groups and the positive influence of the alkyl chain.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be slightly negative, around -0.3.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: 0.575924153128989
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, which is biphenyl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of aromatic rings, substituents, and overall molecular symmetry.

Biphenyl consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond, making it a relatively simple aromatic compound. In the examples, aromatic compounds with similar structures, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tend to have property values around the neutral range, often slightly positive or negative depending on the specific structure and substituents.

Given the examples and the structure of biphenyl, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be around the neutral range. Based on the examples provided, a predicted property value for biphenyl could be approximately 0.0. However, considering the slight positive tendency observed in some aromatic compounds, a more specific prediction could be around 0.1.

Iteration: 9
SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 0.8605498505664837
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can analyze the examples provided and look for patterns or similarities. The molecule CCCCCS is a linear alkane with a sulfur atom at the end, which is similar to other linear alkanes in the examples, such as CCCCCCC(C)O (0.42888611) and CCCCCCC=C (0.91126125). However, the presence of sulfur, which is more electronegative than carbon, might influence the property value.

Considering the examples, linear alkanes tend to have positive property values, but the presence of heteroatoms like sulfur can decrease the value. For instance, the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCSc1ccc(Cl)cc1 has a property value of 0.75071305, which is relatively high, but it also contains additional functional groups that can increase the value.

Given these considerations, the presence of sulfur in CCCCCS is likely to reduce the property value compared to a simple alkane, but it should still be positive. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be around 0.3.

SMILES: CCCC(C)(C)CO
True Property: 0.4549804963547578
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol, specifically 2-methyl-2-butanol. In the examples, we have several aliphatic and branched hydrocarbons, as well as alcohols, which can help us make a prediction:

1. CCC(C)(C)C (2,2-dimethylbutane) has a property value of 0.61382628.
2. CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O (a cyclic alcohol) has a property value of 0.59825661.
3. CCCC(C)(O)CC (a similar branched alcohol) has a property value of -0.47220656.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is similar to CCCC(C)(O)CC, but with a slightly different branching pattern. The presence of the alcohol group (OH) generally tends to lower the property value compared to purely hydrocarbon structures due to increased polarity and potential hydrogen bonding.

Given these considerations, the property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is likely to be negative, similar to CCCC(C)(O)CC, but possibly slightly different due to the specific branching and position of the alcohol group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCC(C)(C)CO would be approximately -0.45.

SMILES: Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1
True Property: -0.7023528277181303
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is a naphthalene derivative, specifically 1-methylnaphthalene.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds, particularly those with naphthalene structures, tend to have higher property values. For instance, the molecule Cc1ccc(C)c2ccccc12 has a property value of 0.93876132, and c1ccccc1 (benzene) has a property value of 0.92945818.

Given that Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is similar to these structures, we can predict that its property value will also be relatively high, likely in the same range as the other naphthalene and benzene derivatives.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 would be approximately 0.93.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic imide, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of 0.63870641. The main difference is the presence of an additional alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) attached to the cyclic imide structure.

The addition of an alkyl chain generally increases hydrophobicity, which can affect the property value. However, the examples show that the presence of alkyl chains can either increase or decrease the property value depending on the overall structure and functional groups present.

Considering the structural similarity to the example and the potential influence of the additional alkyl chain, the property value is likely to be slightly higher than 0.63870641 due to increased hydrophobicity.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be approximately 0.68.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.5568726659560259
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group is known to be electron-withdrawing due to the high electronegativity of fluorine atoms. This can influence the electronic properties of the benzene ring.

Looking at the examples, molecules with electron-withdrawing groups such as halogens (e.g., Cl, Br) or other electronegative atoms tend to have negative property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of -0.8642112, and Oc1ccc(Br)cc1 has a property value of -0.972977. These examples suggest that the presence of electron-withdrawing groups on an aromatic ring tends to result in a negative property value.

Given this trend, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 will also be negative. Considering the strength of the trifluoromethyl group as an electron-withdrawing group, the property value is likely to be moderately negative.

Based on these considerations, I would predict the property value for FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 to be approximately -0.7.

The molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is a sugar alcohol, specifically a form of glucose, which is a polyol with multiple hydroxyl (OH) groups. In the examples, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups, such as OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO, have a negative property value (-0.32793851). This suggests that the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups tends to result in a negative property value.

Considering the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is likely to be negative and similar in magnitude to the example with multiple hydroxyl groups.

Therefore, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately -0.32793851.

Predicting the property value for the given molecule, CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule appears to be a complex cyclic structure with multiple carbonyl groups and hydroxyl groups, similar to some of the examples given.

From the examples, molecules with multiple carbonyl groups and cyclic structures, such as CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCCCC2 and CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, tend to have negative property values. The presence of additional functional groups like hydroxyls and the overall complexity of the structure might further influence the property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C is likely to be negative and similar in magnitude to the more complex cyclic structures with carbonyl groups.

Considering the structural similarities, particularly the presence of multiple fused rings and a hydroxyl group, the property value is likely to be in a similar range. Therefore, I would predict the property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O to be approximately 0.63.

This structure is similar to the example COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, which has a property value of 0.90944458. The presence of the nitro group on the benzene ring is a significant feature that influences the property value, as seen in the examples.

Considering the structural similarity, particularly the nitro group on the aromatic ring, and the influence of the acetamide group, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is likely to be close to the example with the nitrobenzene structure. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be approximately 0.90.

- An aromatic ring with a chlorine substituent, similar to some chlorinated aromatic compounds in the examples.
- An ester linkage (C=O)O, which is present in several examples.
- A thioether linkage (S-C), which is present in the example CSSC with a high positive value.

Given these features, the molecule has a combination of polar and non-polar characteristics, with potential for both positive and negative contributions to the property value. The presence of chlorine on the aromatic ring and the sulfur-containing groups might suggest a positive contribution, as seen in some examples with halogens and sulfur.

Considering these factors and the range of values in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 0.5. This value reflects the balance of the structural features and their potential influence on the property.

True Property: -0.44544822203458384
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)(C)CO, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)(C)CO is a simple alcohol with a tertiary butyl group, also known as tert-butanol. It has a branched structure with a hydroxyl group, which can influence its property value.

Looking at the examples, we see that simple alcohols like CCC(C)O (0.74872808) and longer chain alcohols like CCCCCCCC(C)O (0.42888611) have positive property values. The presence of the hydroxyl group generally contributes to a positive property value, likely due to its polar nature and potential for hydrogen bonding.

Considering the structure of CC(C)(C)CO, it is similar to CCC(C)O but with an additional methyl group, making it more branched. This branching might slightly increase the property value compared to a straight-chain alcohol of similar size.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value for CC(C)(C)CO to be slightly higher than that of CCC(C)O, but still in the positive range. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)(C)CO is approximately:

These examples suggest that the presence of nitrogen heterocycles, especially with carbonyl groups, contributes to a more negative property value.

Considering the structural similarity of the given molecule to these examples, particularly Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1, which has a very similar bicyclic nitrogen-containing structure, it is reasonable to predict a similar negative property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is approximately -1.0.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl formate, an ester. Esters in the examples provided have varying property values, but we can look for patterns. For instance, the molecule CCC(C)C (isopentane) has a property value of 0.61382628, and CCC(C)C(=O)C (isopropyl ketone) has a property value of 0.94079101. Esters like CC(=O)OC3(C)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C have a property value of -1.00648709, but this is a much larger and more complex molecule.

Given that CC(C)OC=O is a small ester, we can expect its property value to be closer to those of smaller, less complex molecules. The presence of the ester functional group (OC=O) might suggest a property value that is slightly negative, as seen in some other small esters or similar functional groups.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)OC=O would be around -0.5. However, given the variability and the specific examples, a more precise prediction would be:

These compounds tend to have negative property values, likely due to the electron-withdrawing nature of the carbonyl and amide groups, as well as the aromatic rings.

Considering the structural similarities and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 is likely to be negative and in the range of the similar compounds provided.

From the examples, we can observe that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and similar aromatic systems tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1, which is a larger polycyclic aromatic system, has a property value of 0.31632063. Similarly, other aromatic compounds like CCCc1ccccc1 have a positive property value of 0.84687487.

Given that triphenylene is a stable, planar aromatic system, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. Considering the trend in the examples, a value around 0.3 to 0.4 seems plausible for this molecule.

- A guanidine group (NC(=N)N)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with sulfonamide groups tend to have negative property values, as seen in examples like Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O (-0.85151656) and CCOc2ccc1nc(sc1c2)S(N)(=O)=O (-0.53537363).
- Aromatic amines, such as NNc1ccccc1 (-0.10235335), also tend to have negative or slightly negative values.
- The presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups, such as sulfonamides and guanidines, can further decrease the property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for NC(=N)NS(=O)(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 is likely to be negative. Based on the trends observed, a reasonable estimate for the property value would be around -0.7.

True Property: -1.009059997939162
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and functional groups present in the molecule and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is known to generally decrease the property value, as seen in examples like Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (-0.75595283) and Clc1ccccc1C2=NCC(=O)Nc3ccc(cc23)N(=O)=O (-1.01780878).
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) attached to the aromatic ring, which can have a variable effect but often contributes to a decrease in the property value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.
- An alkyl chain with a double bond (CC(C)=C), which can increase the property value, as seen in examples like CCCCCC=C (0.91126125).

Considering these features, the presence of two nitro groups and a trifluoromethyl group suggests a significant electron-withdrawing effect, which is likely to decrease the property value. The alkyl chain with a double bond may counteract this to some extent, but the overall effect is expected to be negative.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around -0.8.

SMILES: CC(C)OC=O
True Property: 0.39846642783083314
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, specifically isopropyl formate. Esters generally have a range of property values depending on their specific structure. In the examples, we have:

- CC(C)CCOC=O, which is an ester with a property value of -1.01530883.
- CCC(C)(C)O, an alcohol with a property value of -1.00700662.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is structurally similar to these examples, particularly the ester CC(C)CCOC=O, but with a smaller alkyl group. Smaller alkyl groups often lead to less negative property values compared to larger ones due to reduced hydrophobic interactions.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC(C)OC=O would likely be slightly less negative than -1.01530883. A reasonable estimate would be around -0.950.

SMILES: Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1
True Property: -0.7956459178619562
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is similar to some of the examples given.

Looking at the examples, we have:
- Cc1cccc(C)c1NC(=O)c2cc(c(Cl)cc2O)S(N)(=O)=O with a property value of 0.95893862, which contains a phenol group and additional functional groups.
- c1ccccc1O with a property value of -0.22181889, which is a simple phenol.
- Cc1cccc(N)c1 with a property value of 0.83881988, which is a methyl-substituted aniline.

The molecule Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 is a methyl-substituted phenol, which is closer in structure to c1ccccc1O (phenol) but with an additional methyl group. The presence of the methyl group can increase the electron-donating effect, potentially increasing the property value compared to phenol alone.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 would be slightly higher than that of phenol (c1ccccc1O), but not as high as the more complex structures with additional functional groups.

Therefore, a predicted property value for Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 could be around 0.1.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S) with methoxy groups (OC) and a benzene ring substituted with a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C). 

Looking at the examples, we have:

1. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Br)cc1Cl, with a property value of -0.14639107
2. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl, with a property value of 0.78238834
3. COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, with a property value of 0.55213991

These examples show that the presence of halogens (Cl, Br, I) on the benzene ring significantly influences the property value. The presence of a thiomethyl group (SC) and a methyl group (C) in the target molecule suggests a different electronic environment compared to the halogenated examples.

The thiomethyl group (SC) is less electronegative than halogens, and the methyl group (C) is electron-donating. This could lead to a property value that is less positive than the halogenated examples.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 would be slightly positive, but less than the values for the halogenated examples. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around 0.3.

To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated aromatic compound, similar to some of the examples provided.

From the examples, we can observe that highly chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values. For instance:
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.67449076.
- Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 0.47641379.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is similar in structure to these examples, with multiple chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings. Based on the trend observed, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for this molecule will also be positive and likely within a similar range.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately 0.5.

SMILES: CCCN(=O)=O
True Property: 0.8807355784720994
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple aliphatic chain with a nitro group attached to the terminal carbon. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with nitro groups and simple aliphatic chains.

From the examples, we observe that:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O and O=N(=O)c1cc(cc(c1)N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, tend to have negative property values.
- Simple aliphatic chains without additional functional groups, such as CCC, tend to have property values close to zero or slightly negative.

Considering these observations, the presence of the nitro group in CCCN(=O)=O is likely to contribute to a negative property value. However, the simplicity of the molecule compared to more complex aromatic systems with multiple nitro groups suggests that the value might not be as negative as those more complex structures.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be slightly negative, but not as extreme as the more complex nitro-containing examples. Therefore, I would predict a property value around -0.1.

To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a fluorobenzene with a bromine substituent, which can be compared to similar structures in the examples.

1. **Clc1ccc(Br)cc1**: This is a chlorobenzene with a bromine substituent, and its property value is -0.89338502.
2. **COc1cccc(Cl)c1**: This is a chlorobenzene with a methoxy group, and its property value is 0.03487628.

4. **Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl**: This is a dichlorobenzene, and its property value is -0.33056791.
5. **c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12**: This is a bromobenzene, and its property value is 0.66698711.

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar to the chlorobenzene with a bromine substituent (Clc1ccc(Br)cc1), but with fluorine instead of chlorine. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which might affect the property value. However, the presence of bromine, which is less electronegative than fluorine, might balance the effect.

Considering the examples, the property values for halogen-substituted benzenes range from negative to slightly positive, depending on the specific substituents and their positions. Given the electronegativity and the nature of the substituents, the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is likely to be slightly negative, similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but possibly less negative due to the presence of fluorine.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is approximately -0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is a bicyclic compound with a tertiary alcohol group. It resembles a bicyclo[2.2.1]heptane structure with an additional methyl group and a hydroxyl group. This structure is similar to some of the examples provided, particularly those with cyclic and bicyclic structures.

From the examples, we observe that molecules with cyclic structures and alcohol groups tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule Oc1ccccn1 has a property value of 0.88998847, and CCCCCC(C)O has a property value of 0.94969412. These examples suggest that the presence of an alcohol group in a cyclic structure contributes positively to the property value.

Considering the structural similarity and the presence of the alcohol group, we can predict that the property value for CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 will be positive and likely in the range of the examples with similar features.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1(C)C2CCC1(C)C(O)C2 is approximately 0.85.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)OCC)
- An amide linkage (N2C(=O))
- A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1)

Comparing this structure to the examples:
- The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O has a similar phosphorothioate group and an amide linkage, with a property value of -0.9153154.
- The presence of a phenyl ring is common in many examples, but the specific combination of functional groups and their arrangement is more similar to the example with the phosphorothioate group.

Given the structural similarities, particularly the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is likely to be close to -0.9153154. However, since the molecule lacks the thioether linkage present in the example, the property value might be slightly different.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is approximately -0.9.

This structure is somewhat similar to the example molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1C, which has a property value of 0.91680757. However, the presence of the carbonyl group and the nitrogen heterocycle in the target molecule could influence the property value.

Considering the examples, molecules with aromatic rings and additional functional groups like carbonyls or heterocycles tend to have positive property values, often in the range of 0.3 to 0.9. Given the structural similarities and the influence of the carbonyl and nitrogen heterocycle, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be around 0.7.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C is approximately 0.7.

- CCOC(=O)N, another small ester, has a property value of -0.41519856.
- CC(C)OC(=O)C, a branched ester, has a property value of -0.0055567.

The molecule CCCCCCC(=O)OCC is more similar to CCCCCCC(=O)OC in terms of structure, as both are linear esters with a similar number of carbon atoms. Given this similarity, we can expect the property value to be close to -0.71587992.

3. The molecule COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is similar to CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, which has a property value of 0.08170301.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is likely to be positive and close to the value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately 0.08.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups, the degree of unsaturation, and the overall molecular structure.

The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear conjugated diene, which is a relatively simple structure compared to the more complex molecules in the examples. The presence of conjugated double bonds can influence the property value, often leading to a more negative value due to increased electron delocalization and potential for interaction with other molecules.

Looking at the examples, simpler alkenes and alkynes tend to have negative property values. For instance, CC/C=C/C has a property value of -0.61653543, and C=Cc1ccccc1 has a property value of -0.09373278. Given that C=CCC=C is a simple conjugated diene, it is reasonable to predict a property value in the negative range, similar to these examples.

To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br, also known as tribromomethane or bromoform, is a simple halogenated compound with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples provided, halogenated aromatic compounds like Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1 have a positive property value (0.66698711), while more complex halogenated structures with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl, have a negative property value (-0.87403137).

Given that BrC(Br)Br is a small, non-aromatic, and highly halogenated molecule, it is likely to have a property value that is negative, similar to other simple halogenated compounds. However, due to its simplicity and lack of aromaticity, the value might not be as negative as the more complex halogenated structures.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around -0.5.

5. **Tert-butyl Group (C(C)(C)C):** This bulky group can affect the property value, as seen in molecules like CCC(C)C (-0.94571488).

Considering these structural features and their influence on the property values of similar molecules, the given molecule is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of the amide group, chlorine substituent, and heterocyclic ring. Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CN(C)C(=O)Nc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)n2nc(oc2=O)C(C)(C)C would be approximately -0.7.

The molecule in question has two chlorinated phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage, which might suggest a property value that is negative, similar to other chlorinated aromatic compounds.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl would be around -0.9. However, given the specific structure and the presence of the ether linkage, a slightly less negative value might be appropriate. Therefore, a predicted property value could be approximately -0.85.

The molecule CC/C=C\C is a simple linear alkene, similar to the example CC/C=C/C, which has a property value of -0.61653543. Given the structural similarity and the fact that both molecules are linear alkenes with similar chain lengths, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC/C=C\C will be very close to that of CC/C=C/C.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC/C=C\C is approximately -0.61653543.

The molecule CC(C)O has a property value of -0.73241919, and it contains an alcohol group, which is somewhat similar to the ether group in CCCOCC. However, the presence of the ether group and the linear structure might suggest a different property value.

Considering the examples, simpler linear alkanes and ethers tend to have property values closer to zero, with some variation depending on the specific functional groups and branching. For instance, CCCCC(C)(O)CC has a property value of -0.03958717, which is a linear chain with an alcohol group.

Given the structure of CCCOCC and its similarity to simple ethers and alkanes, a reasonable prediction for its property value would be close to zero, but slightly negative due to the ether group.

- A bromobenzene moiety (c1ccc(Br)cc1), which is similar to the structure in Fc1cccc(Br)c1 with a property value of 0.95099176.

The presence of the bromine atom on the benzene ring is a significant factor, as seen in the example Fc1cccc(Br)c1, which has a high positive property value. The acetamide group may slightly reduce the property value compared to the fluorobenzene example due to its electron-withdrawing nature, but the overall influence of the bromine on the aromatic ring is likely to dominate.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to be positive and somewhat close to the value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately 0.85.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is isobutylbenzene, which consists of an isobutyl group (CC(C)C) attached to a benzene ring (c1ccccc1).

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with aromatic rings (benzene derivatives) tend to have positive property values, often above 0.5.
- The presence of alkyl groups (such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl) attached to aromatic rings generally results in higher property values.
- The presence of additional functional groups or heteroatoms can significantly alter the property value, often reducing it.

Considering these trends, the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is similar to other alkyl-substituted benzene derivatives, such as Cc1ccccc1N (0.83881988) and CCc1ccc(C)cc1 (0.95701501). These examples suggest that the property value for isobutylbenzene is likely to be positive and relatively high.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 would be approximately 0.9.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: 0.4759469345188248
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached. In the examples, we have several aromatic compounds and carbonyl-containing compounds. Let's analyze the relevant examples:

1. NC(=O)c1ccccc1O, -0.10633924: This molecule is salicylamide, which has an amide group and a phenol group attached to a benzene ring. The presence of the carbonyl group and the aromatic ring is similar to benzaldehyde.

2. COc1ccccc1, 0.91347117: This is anisole, an aromatic compound with a methoxy group. It has a high positive property value, likely due to the electron-donating methoxy group.

3. O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O, 0.49846937: This is a dinitrobenzene, an aromatic compound with electron-withdrawing nitro groups, resulting in a positive property value.

4. Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, -0.75595283: This is nitrophenol, an aromatic compound with both a hydroxyl and a nitro group, resulting in a negative property value.

5. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, 0.71515846: This is a chlorinated benzene, which has a positive property value due to the electron-withdrawing chlorine atoms.

Benzaldehyde has an electron-withdrawing carbonyl group attached to the benzene ring, similar to the amide group in salicylamide. The presence of the carbonyl group in benzaldehyde is likely to result in a property value that is slightly negative or close to zero, as seen in the example of salicylamide.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) would be slightly negative, similar to the value for salicylamide.

SMILES: O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 
True Property: -0.23383146327347365
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples.
- An aromatic ring with a heteroatom (oxygen), similar to some of the examples.
- A cyclic urea structure (O=C2CN...C(=O)N2), which is not directly represented in the examples but can be related to other cyclic structures.

From the examples, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings tend to have a range of property values, often negative or slightly positive. The presence of heteroatoms like oxygen and nitrogen in aromatic systems can influence the property value, often making it more negative.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be slightly negative, reflecting the influence of the nitro group and the heteroatom in the aromatic system.

Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.2.

SMILES: N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 
True Property: -0.8063489554441193
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 is a diaryl hydrazine, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a hydrazine group. This structure is similar to the example N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -0.508044. The main difference between the two is the presence of a double-bonded nitrogen in the example, which is not present in the molecule we are analyzing.

The removal of the double bond in the hydrazine group could potentially make the molecule less electron-withdrawing compared to the azo compound, possibly leading to a slightly less negative property value. However, the overall aromatic character and the presence of the hydrazine linkage suggest that the property value will still be in the negative range.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would be slightly less negative than -0.508044. Therefore, a predicted property value could be around -0.45.

The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. In the examples, cyclic structures with amide groups, such as C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1, have negative property values. The diketopiperazine structure is somewhat similar to this example, which has a property value of -0.77803585.

Considering the structural similarities and the presence of amide groups, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 will also be negative. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.8.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is approximately -0.8.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) with three chlorine atoms attached to a biphenyl structure.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple chlorine atoms and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values. For instance, Clc1ccccc1Cl has a property value of -0.99291022, and Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a property value of -0.19243033. These examples suggest that the presence of chlorine atoms and aromatic rings contributes to a negative property value.

Given that Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl has a similar structure to these examples, with three chlorine atoms and two aromatic rings, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Considering the trend in the examples, a value around -0.9 to -1.0 seems plausible.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is approximately -0.95.

True Property: -0.11967467268926608
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a simple alkyl-substituted benzene, specifically ethylbenzene with an additional ethyl group, making it diethylbenzene.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with alkyl substitutions tend to have positive property values. For instance, Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) has a property value of 0.83881988, and CCc1ccccn1 (ethylpyridine) has a property value of 0.95899074. These examples suggest that aromatic rings with alkyl or similar substitutions generally have positive property values.

Given the structure of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, which is similar to these examples but with two ethyl groups, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. Considering the trend and the nature of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 would be around 0.9.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is a sulfonamide derivative with a benzene ring. The presence of the sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is a key feature. In the examples, molecules with nitro groups (N(=O)=O) and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values, such as:

- Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, with a property value of -1.01550189
- Cc1c(cccc1N(=O)=O)N(=O)=O, with a property value of 0.41661581

The sulfonamide group is somewhat similar to the nitro group in terms of electron-withdrawing nature, but it is generally less electron-withdrawing than a nitro group. Additionally, the presence of the benzene ring contributes to the overall property value.

Considering these factors, the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is likely to be negative, but not as negative as the nitrobenzene derivative. A reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -0.8 to -0.9.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is approximately -0.85.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically triphenylene. It consists of four fused benzene rings, forming a planar, aromatic structure. In the examples, similar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as naphthalene derivatives, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12 has a property value of 0.58767589, and it is a polycyclic aromatic compound with a methyl group.

Considering the aromatic nature and the structural similarity to other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the examples, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value for triphenylene. However, without additional substituents or specific functional groups that might significantly alter the property, the value is likely to be moderate.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 (triphenylene) would be around 0.5.

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. It resembles some of the structures in the examples, particularly those with aromatic rings and multiple hydroxyl groups, which tend to have positive property values.

For instance, the molecule Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4 has a property value of 0.8382953, and it shares some structural similarities with the given molecule, such as the presence of aromatic rings and hydroxyl groups.

Considering these structural similarities and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for the molecule Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 is likely to be positive and close to the value of similar structures.

True Property: -0.9652193239773632
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=O)(S)O), an amide group (NC(C)=O), and a thioether linkage (SC). In the examples, molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, have a property value of 0.55213991, and those with amide groups, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Cl)cc1, have a property value of -0.30159181.

Considering the presence of both a phosphorothioate and an amide group, the property value is likely to be influenced by both functionalities. The presence of the thioether linkage (SC) might also contribute to the property value, but its effect is less clear from the examples.

Given these considerations, the property value for COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is likely to be intermediate between the values for similar functional groups. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC is approximately 0.1.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is 1,2-dichloroethene, which is a small, symmetrical molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. In the examples, molecules with halogen atoms, particularly chlorine, tend to have positive property values, especially when they are part of aromatic systems or larger structures. However, smaller and more symmetrical molecules with halogens, like Cl\C=C/Cl, might not follow the same trend due to their simplicity and lack of additional stabilizing or polarizing groups.

Considering the examples, smaller molecules with halogens, such as CCBr (-0.16168429) and CCCBr (-0.9024554), have negative property values. Given the simplicity and symmetry of Cl\C=C/Cl, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value, likely closer to the smaller halogenated molecules.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl would be around -0.2.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with nitrogen, such as c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23, have a positive property value (0.07239087). Additionally, the presence of nitrogen in aromatic systems often contributes to a positive property value, as seen in other nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds.

Considering these observations, the predicted property value for pyridine (c1ccncc1) is likely to be positive and relatively small. Based on the trends in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of pyridine would be approximately 0.07.

The molecule in question has several key features:
1. An ester linkage (OC(=O)).
2. A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1).
3. An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23).
4. A pyridine-like structure (ccnc).
5. A chlorine substituent on an aromatic ring.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have negative property values (e.g., Clc1ccc(I)cc1, -0.8642112; Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl, -0.93853797).
- Molecules with ester and amide linkages also tend to have negative property values (e.g., CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1OC(C)C, -0.86624308; CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC, -0.91051566).
- The presence of multiple aromatic rings and heteroatoms (like nitrogen in pyridine) can further influence the property value negatively.

Considering these factors, the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 is likely to have a negative property value due to the combination of aromatic rings, halogen substituent, and the presence of ester and amide linkages.

Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.85.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCO, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol with a five-carbon chain, also known as 1-pentanol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Linear alkanes and alcohols tend to have positive property values. For instance, OC1CCCCCCC1 has a property value of -1.01275758, which is an outlier due to its cyclic structure.
- Simple linear alkanes like CCCCCC (hexane) or similar structures tend to have positive values, such as CCCCCCI (0.75762855).

Given that CCCCCO is a simple linear alcohol, we can expect its property value to be positive, similar to other linear alkanes and alcohols. Based on the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be around 0.75.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule has the following features:
- A sulfonyl group (S(=O)(=O)) attached to a cyclic structure.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N) connected to an aromatic ring (phenyl group).
- An ether linkage (CCO) in the cyclic structure.

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with sulfonyl groups, such as CCOP(=S)(NC(C)C)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)OC(C)C, tend to have negative property values.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CC(=O)Nc1ccc(F)cc1, have positive property values.
- Aromatic rings are common in both positive and negative property value examples, so they might not be a strong determinant on their own.

Considering these observations, the presence of the sulfonyl group might have a stronger influence towards a negative property value, but the amide linkage and aromatic ring could counterbalance this to some extent.

Based on the structural analysis and comparison with the examples, I would predict a slightly negative property value for the given molecule. A reasonable estimate could be around -0.2.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. The molecule contains an aromatic ring, nitro group, ester groups, and a heterocyclic ring, which are features that appear in some of the examples with both positive and negative property values.

The presence of the nitro group, which is often associated with negative property values in the examples, and the ester groups, which can contribute to either positive or negative values depending on the context, suggests a complex interaction of factors. The aromatic ring and heterocyclic structure are also common in molecules with both positive and negative values.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be slightly negative, as the nitro group might have a more dominant influence. Therefore, I would predict a property value around -0.2.

The given molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. It has two carbonyl groups (C=O) and two nitrogen atoms in a six-membered ring. This structure is relatively small and compact, with a high degree of symmetry.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar features, such as cyclic structures with carbonyl groups and nitrogen atoms, tend to have property values that are not extremely high or low. For instance, the molecule ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of -0.21755438, which is relatively moderate.

Considering the compact and symmetric nature of the diketopiperazine, along with the presence of carbonyl groups and nitrogen atoms, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is slightly negative but not too extreme.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around -0.2.

The molecule ClCC is a simple structure, consisting of a chloroethane (ethyl chloride) group. In the examples, simple aliphatic hydrocarbons like CCCCC have negative property values, while aromatic and more complex structures tend to have positive or less negative values. Halogenated compounds like Clc1ccccc1I and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl also have negative values, but they are more complex than ClCC.

Given the simplicity of ClCC and the trend observed in the examples, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value for ClCC, similar to other simple aliphatic or halogenated compounds.

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCC is approximately -0.8.

- The presence of a pyridine ring, as in c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 (0.60113807), can influence the property value, but the effect of the chlorine atoms is likely more dominant in this case.

Considering these observations, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms and the aromatic nature of the compound suggest a negative property value. Given the structural similarity to other chlorinated aromatic compounds with negative values, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl would be around -0.9.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is approximately -0.9.

   - ClC(=C)Cl has a property value of -0.39618272.

2. The presence of multiple halogen atoms, especially heavier ones like bromine, might further influence the property value towards the negative side.

Considering these observations, the property value for 1,4-dibromobenzene (Brc1ccc(Br)cc1) is likely to be negative. Given the trend in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around -0.3 to -0.5.

The given molecule has a similar structure but with fewer chlorine atoms. The example molecule is a hexachlorobiphenyl, while the given molecule is a tetrachlorobiphenyl. The presence of fewer chlorine atoms might slightly reduce the property value compared to the hexachlorobiphenyl.

Considering the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl is likely to be slightly lower than 0.94240591. A reasonable estimate would be around 0.8 to 0.9.

3. Alkyl groups: Methyl groups attached to the aromatic rings, which are present in both positive and negative examples.

Considering the examples, molecules with complex aromatic systems and additional functional groups like phosphoryl or carbonyl tend to have negative property values. The presence of multiple aromatic rings and the phosphoryl group suggests a more negative property value.

Based on these observations, I would predict a negative property value for this molecule. A reasonable estimate, considering the examples, would be around -0.5. However, this is a qualitative prediction, and the exact value could vary.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O
True Property: 0.9424218534880285
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3), which is known to be electron-withdrawing and can influence the molecule's polarity and reactivity.
- An aromatic ring, which is common in many of the examples.
- A nitrogen-containing heterocycle, which can affect the electronic properties.
- Chlorine atoms, which are also electron-withdrawing and can impact the molecule's overall electronic distribution.

Looking at the examples, molecules with electron-withdrawing groups like nitro (NO2), trifluoromethyl (CF3), and multiple halogens (Cl, Br) tend to have negative property values, indicating a certain electronic or steric effect that these groups impart.

Given the presence of the CF3 group, the aromatic ring, and the chlorine atoms, the molecule is likely to have a property value that is negative, similar to other molecules with strong electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O would be around -0.5. This value reflects the influence of the electron-withdrawing groups and the structural similarity to other molecules with negative property values in the examples.

True Property: 0.9094445833591833
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule is a nitrobenzene derivative with a methoxy group, which can be represented as a methoxybenzene (anisole) with a nitro group attached.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tend to increase the property value, as seen in molecules like O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (0.49846937).
- Methoxy groups (OCH3) are electron-donating and can influence the property value, as seen in CN(C)C(=O)Nc2ccc(Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1)cc2 (0.3030691).

Considering these factors, the presence of both a methoxy group and a nitro group suggests a balance between electron-donating and electron-withdrawing effects. The property value is likely to be positive but not extremely high, as the nitro group is a strong electron-withdrawing group.

Based on these observations and comparisons, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be around 0.3.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, involves analyzing its structural features and comparing them to the examples provided. This molecule is a highly chlorinated polycyclic compound, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 0.43856322.

Given the high degree of chlorination and the polycyclic structure, the property value is likely to be in a similar range. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms typically increases the property value due to their electronegative nature and the impact on molecular interactions.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl would be approximately 0.45.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CCCOC=O is an ester, specifically propyl formate. Esters generally have moderate to low polarity and can participate in hydrogen bonding as acceptors but not as donors.

Looking at the examples, we can find some similar structures:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1, with a property value of 0.13719208, is an ester with an aromatic ring and an amine group, which might increase its polarity compared to CCCOC=O.
2. CCC#C, with a property value of -0.47473277, is a small alkyne, which is less polar than an ester.
3. CCCCCC#C, with a property value of 0.9492855, is a longer alkyne chain, which is less polar than an ester but has a higher property value due to its size.

Considering the structure of CCCOC=O, it is a small ester without additional polar groups or aromatic rings. It is likely to have a property value closer to the lower end of the positive range, similar to other small esters or non-aromatic compounds.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be around 0.1.

In the examples, we see that similar structures, such as esters and long-chain hydrocarbons, tend to have negative property values. For instance, CCOC(=O)CCN(SN(C)C(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc21)C(C)C has a property value of -0.74597728, and CCCO has a property value of -0.55269959.

Given the structure of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, which is a simple ester with a long alkyl chain, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is negative and similar to other esters or long-chain hydrocarbons in the examples.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is approximately -0.6.

To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. This molecule is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which consists of a phenol group (hydroxyl group attached to a benzene ring) and a nitro group (NO2) attached to the benzene ring.

From the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, have a property value of -0.18778833.
- Molecules with phenol groups, such as Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, have a property value of 0.56947632.

The presence of both a nitro group and a phenol group in the same molecule suggests that the property value might be influenced by both functional groups. The nitro group tends to have a negative impact on the property value, while the phenol group tends to have a positive impact.

Considering these factors, the property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is likely to be slightly negative, as the negative influence of the nitro group might outweigh the positive influence of the phenol group. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -0.1 to -0.2.

OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O

This molecule is a complex sugar, likely a polysaccharide or a derivative, given the multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic acetal structures. In the examples provided, molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and cyclic structures, such as sugars, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, which is a simple sugar, has a property value of -0.79669956.

Considering the structural similarity and the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups, which generally contribute to a more negative property value due to increased polarity and hydrogen bonding potential, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for this complex sugar molecule will also be negative and likely in a similar range to the simple sugar example.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately -0.8.

Given the presence of the pyridine ring and the hydrazide group, which are similar to the structures in the examples with negative values, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 will also be negative.

Considering the structural similarities and the trend in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be around -0.7.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to consider the structural features and functional groups present in the molecule and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N)
- A piperidine ring (N1CCCCC1)
- Several alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with phosphorothioate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(N(=O)=O)c(C)c1, have a property value of -0.03797133.
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CN(C)C(=O)N(C)C, have a property value of -0.977202.
- Molecules with piperidine rings, such as Cn2c(=O)n(C)c1ncn(CC(O)CO)c1c2=O, have a property value of 0.23411623.

Considering these structural features and their associated property values, the presence of both the phosphorothioate group and the amide linkage suggests a negative property value. However, the presence of the piperidine ring, which is associated with a positive property value, may offset this to some extent.

Taking into account the balance of these features, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be slightly negative, but not as negative as the most negative examples. Therefore, I would predict a property value of approximately -0.250.

2. CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of -0.91832769.

Both of these examples have polycyclic structures with ketone groups (C=O) and hydroxyl groups (O), similar to the molecule in question. The presence of the carbon-carbon triple bond (C#C) in the target molecule might influence the property value, but the overall structure and functional groups suggest a similarity to the examples provided.

- CCCCCCCC(=O)C (a ketone) with a property value of 0.41819548
- CCCCOC=O (an ester) with a property value of -0.4928373

The molecule CCCCCOC=O is structurally similar to CCCCOC=O, but with a longer alkyl chain. The presence of the ester functional group and the longer alkyl chain suggests that the property value might be slightly different from the shorter chain ester.

Considering the trend that longer alkyl chains in similar functional groups tend to have slightly higher property values, we can predict that the property value for CCCCCOC=O might be slightly higher than -0.4928373.

- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, such as Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl and Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl, have property values of -0.87403137 and 0.67449076, respectively.
- The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally tends to result in negative property values, but the specific arrangement and additional structural features can influence the final value.

Given the structure of Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, which is a biphenyl with four chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is negative, considering the influence of the chlorine atoms.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl would be approximately -0.8.

True Property: -0.6165354284247254
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided. The molecule CC=C(C)C is isoprene, a simple hydrocarbon with a double bond and a branched methyl group.

From the examples, we can observe that simple hydrocarbons with double bonds, such as CCCCCCCC=C, have negative property values. The presence of a double bond and the relatively small size of the molecule suggest that the property value might be negative.

Considering the examples and the structural features of isoprene, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around -0.9.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: -0.02456935311740819
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl (dichloromethane), we can analyze the trends in the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall molecular complexity.

In the examples, molecules with multiple chlorine atoms, especially those with high symmetry or simple structures, tend to have negative property values. For instance, ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl has a property value of -0.98241095, and Clc1cc(c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of -0.97725527. These examples suggest that the presence of multiple chlorine atoms in a simple structure correlates with a negative property value.

Given that ClCCl is a simple molecule with two chlorine atoms, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Based on the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be around -0.95.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 0.5694763180028968
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl (2,4,6-trichlorophenol) has a property value of 0.56947632.
2. The presence of chlorine atoms generally tends to decrease the property value, as seen in other chlorinated compounds.
3. The presence of a hydroxyl group (OH) in aromatic compounds like phenols tends to increase the property value, as seen in other examples with phenolic structures.

Given these observations, the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is very similar to the example Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl, which has a property value of 0.56947632. Since the structures are identical, the predicted property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl should be the same:

SMILES: COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67
True Property: -0.5573355335225991
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for a complex molecule like COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 based on the given examples involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known molecules.

The molecule in question appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as aromatic rings and oxygen-containing functional groups. The presence of methoxy groups (OC) and hydroxyl groups (O) suggests some degree of polarity, which could influence the property value.

Given the examples, molecules with high aromatic content and multiple oxygen functionalities tend to have property values that are not extremely high or low, often falling in the mid-range. For instance, molecules with similar complexity and oxygen content, such as O=C1N(COC(=O)CCCCC)C(=O)C(N1)(c2ccccc2)c3ccccc3 (0.82869243) and COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(I)cc1Cl (0.78238834), have property values around 0.7 to 0.9.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule would be around 0.8. This accounts for the complexity, aromatic content, and presence of polar functional groups, aligning it with similar molecules in the provided examples.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -0.8027566652556427
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C). The presence of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) atoms, along with the carbonyl group (C=O), suggests potential for hydrogen bonding and polar interactions, which can influence the property value.

Looking at the examples, molecules with similar heteroatoms and functional groups, such as CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C (-0.45158717) and Oc2ncc1nccnc1n2 (-0.55796546), have negative property values. These examples suggest that the presence of nitrogen and sulfur in a heterocyclic structure tends to result in a negative property value.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C is likely to be negative. Based on the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately -0.45.

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: 0.08170301445663165
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ethyl benzoate, which is an ester formed from benzoic acid and ethanol. In the examples, we have several esters and aromatic compounds:

1. CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1S(=O)(=O)NN(C=O)c2nc(Cl)cc(OC)n2 has a property value of -1.01130599.
2. CCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of 0.78024874.
3. CCCCC(=O)OCC has a property value of 0.78024874.

The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is structurally similar to the ester CCCCC(=O)OCC, which has a property value of 0.78024874. Both molecules are esters with a similar functional group arrangement, although CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 has an aromatic ring instead of a longer aliphatic chain.

Considering the influence of the aromatic ring, which might slightly alter the property value compared to the aliphatic ester, we can predict that the property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 will be close to, but possibly slightly lower than, 0.78024874.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately 0.75.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 0.5656963872912648
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of certain functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom at the end. In the examples, linear alkyl chains such as CCCCCCCCO and CCCCCCC=C have negative property values, indicating that longer alkyl chains tend to have negative property values. Additionally, the presence of a halogen (like bromine) in the example Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which has a positive property value, suggests that aromatic systems with halogens might have positive values, but this is not directly applicable to a simple alkyl chain.

Considering the examples of linear alkyl chains and the presence of a halogen, it is reasonable to predict that CCCCCCCBr will have a negative property value, similar to other linear alkyl chains. However, the presence of bromine might slightly influence the value compared to a pure alkane.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around -0.6 to -0.7, considering the negative trend of linear alkyl chains and the slight influence of the bromine atom. Therefore, a specific predicted property value could be:

-0.65

SMILES: CO
True Property: 0.13474957304895288
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide) based on the examples provided is challenging due to the lack of similar simple diatomic molecules in the dataset. However, considering the general trend and the nature of carbon monoxide as a small, neutral, and relatively non-polar molecule, I would predict a property value close to zero. 

Given the examples, a reasonable estimate for the property value of CO could be around 0.0.
