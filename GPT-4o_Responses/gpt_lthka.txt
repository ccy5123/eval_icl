SMILES: CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC
True Property: 365.3491613831558
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC, we can look for patterns in the given examples. The molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is a linear ester with a long carbon chain, similar to other esters and alkanes in the examples.

Let's consider the examples with similar structures:
- CCCCCCCCC(=O)OC has a property value of 365.34916138.
- CCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is one carbon longer than the above example.

From the examples, it seems that adding a CH2 group to a linear alkane or ester increases the property value by a certain amount. However, the exact increment is not directly given, but we can infer that the property value for CCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC should be slightly higher than 365.34916138.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC is approximately 365.34916138.

SMILES: Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2
True Property: -281.0378164485809
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule is a chlorinated aromatic compound with a lactam (cyclic amide) structure.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Chlorinated aromatic compounds like Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl and Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c1Cl have relatively high property values (487.13221518 and 1302.14188288, respectively).
- Compounds with a lactam structure, such as O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC, have negative property values (-440.2925791).

The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 combines both features: a chlorinated aromatic ring and a lactam. The presence of chlorine generally increases the property value, while the lactam structure tends to decrease it.

Considering these factors, the property value for Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is likely to be a balance between the high values associated with chlorination and the lower values associated with the lactam. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around the midpoint of these influences.

Given the examples and the structural analysis, the predicted property value for Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 is approximately:

SMILES: CC(C)N(=O)=O
True Property: 299.7736708784867
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CC(C)N(=O)=O is isopropyl nitrite, which contains an isopropyl group (CC(C)) and a nitro group (N(=O)=O).

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Cc1ncc(N(=O)=O)n1CCO, tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of alkyl groups like isopropyl (CC(C)) in molecules such as CCC(C)CC, which has a positive property value, suggests that alkyl groups might contribute positively to the property value.

Considering these observations, the presence of the nitro group is likely to have a significant negative impact on the property value, while the isopropyl group might slightly offset this effect. However, given the strong influence of the nitro group, the overall property value is expected to be negative.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(C)N(=O)=O would be around -400.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO, we need to analyze its structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple rings and carbonyl groups. It resembles steroid-like structures, which are often found in the examples with property values around zero or slightly negative. For instance, the molecule CC(=O)C1CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC12C has a property value of 0.0, and it shares a similar polycyclic framework with carbonyl groups.

Given the structural similarities, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CC12CC(O)C3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1C(=O)CO will be close to zero. Therefore, the predicted property value is:

0.0

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A difluorobenzene moiety (Fc1cccc(F)c1), which is similar to FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 with a property value of -65.5754905.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)NC(=O)N), which is a common feature in several molecules but not directly comparable to any specific example.
- A chlorobenzene moiety (c2ccc(Cl)cc2), which is similar to Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1 with a property value of 674.49075948.

The molecule is a combination of these structural features. The presence of both electron-withdrawing groups (fluorine and chlorine) and the amide linkage suggests a property value that might be influenced by these factors.

Considering the examples, the presence of halogens (F and Cl) and the amide linkage might suggest a property value that is negative, as seen in other complex aromatic structures with electron-withdrawing groups.

Based on the analysis and comparison with similar structures, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(F)c1C(=O)NC(=O)Nc2ccc(Cl)cc2 would be approximately -159.25476265, which is similar to NC(=S)Nc1ccccc1, another structure with electron-withdrawing groups and an amide-like linkage.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC(C)C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some aspect of molecular stability, energy, or interaction.

The molecule CCCOC(C)C is a simple ether with a linear chain and a branching methyl group. In the examples, similar simple aliphatic molecules with ethers or alcohols, such as CCCCCCO (824.37759492) and CCCCCC(O)CC (824.37759492), have property values around 824.38. These molecules are structurally similar to CCCOC(C)C in terms of having a simple carbon chain with an oxygen atom.

Based on this pattern, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is likely to be similar to these examples. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCOC(C)C is 824.37759492.

SMILES: CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O 
True Property: 74.94341771962173
Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O, involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them with the examples provided. The molecule is a substituted pyrrole with a bromine atom and two carbonyl groups.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of halogens, especially bromine, tends to increase the property value. Additionally, carbonyl groups can have varying effects depending on their context within the molecule. The presence of a pyrrole ring, which is a heterocyclic aromatic compound, might also influence the property value.

Considering these factors and comparing with similar structures in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC(C)n1c(=O)[nH]c(C)c(Br)c1=O would be around -500.0. This is a rough estimate based on the trends observed in the provided data.

SMILES: c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2
True Property: -599.5473417569729
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2, we need to analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is biphenyl, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a single bond.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Simple aromatic hydrocarbons like benzene derivatives tend to have negative property values.
- Larger, more complex aromatic systems tend to have more negative values.
- The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure and possibly the number of aromatic rings or the degree of conjugation.

Given that biphenyl is a relatively simple aromatic compound with two phenyl rings, we can compare it to similar structures in the examples:

- Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O has a property value of -140.51890822.
- Nc3cc2c1ccccc1ccc2c4ccccc34 has a property value of -1517.60420882, which is a more complex aromatic system.
- Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 has a property value of -843.11344935, which is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.

Considering these examples, biphenyl is simpler than the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons but more complex than a single benzene ring. Therefore, its property value should be less negative than the more complex systems but more negative than a single benzene ring.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of biphenyl (c1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2) would be around -355.98123417, similar to Cc1cc2ccccc2cc1C, which is a methyl-substituted biphenyl.

SMILES: CCCCS
True Property: 1189.7267562989941
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCS, we can look for patterns in the given examples. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size and shape of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCS is a linear chain of five carbon atoms with a sulfur atom at the end. This structure is similar to the linear alkanes in the examples, such as CCCCCCC=C (618.28319619) and CCCCCCC(C)C (861.84930378). The presence of sulfur, however, might slightly alter the property value compared to a pure hydrocarbon chain.

Given the examples, it seems that the presence of sulfur might not drastically change the property value compared to a similar hydrocarbon chain. Therefore, the property value for CCCCCS is likely to be close to that of a similar-sized alkane.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCS would be around 618.28319619, similar to the linear alkane CCCCCCC=C.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO, we can look for similar structures in the provided examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is a branched alcohol with a structure similar to other branched alkanes and alcohols in the list.

From the examples:
- CCC(C)(C)C has a property value of 861.84930378.
- CC(C)C1CCC(C)CC1O has a property value of 824.37759492.
- CCCC(C)(O)CC has a property value of 824.37759492.
- CCCCC(=O)OCC has a property value of 365.34916138.

The molecule CCCC(C)(C)CO is most similar to CCCC(C)(O)CC, which is a branched alcohol with a similar structure. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCC(C)(C)CO is likely to be close to 824.37759492.

To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1, we can look for similar structures in the provided examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is a naphthalene derivative, which is similar to the structure Cc1ccc2c(ccc3ccccc32)c1 with a known property value of -843.11344935. 

Given the structural similarity, we can predict that the property value for Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 will be close to -843.11344935. However, since Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 is a simpler structure (a naphthalene with a methyl group), it might have a slightly different value. Considering the pattern and the structural complexity, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc2ccccc2c1 would be approximately -843.11344935.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C, we can analyze the structure and compare it to the examples provided.

The given molecule is a derivative of a cyclic urea, similar to the example O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C)CC=C, which has a property value of -683.85868669. The main difference between the two molecules is the substitution of a methyl group (C) with a more complex alkyl chain (C(C)CCC) in the given molecule.

The addition of a larger alkyl group generally increases the molecular weight and can affect the electronic distribution, but the core structure remains similar. Based on the examples, the property values seem to be influenced by the molecular structure and functional groups.

Considering the similarity in the core structure and the nature of the substitution, the property value for the given molecule is likely to be close to that of the example with a slight adjustment for the increased size and complexity of the substituent.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(C(C)CCC)CC=C would be slightly more negative than -683.85868669, due to the increased size and potential electronic effects of the larger substituent. A predicted value could be around -700.0, accounting for these factors.

SMILES: FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1
True Property: -65.57549050466892
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 is trifluoromethylbenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a trifluoromethyl group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that aromatic compounds with halogen substituents tend to have positive property values. For instance, Clc1ccc(I)cc1 has a property value of 1086.67955693, and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1030.47199364. These values are relatively high and positive, likely due to the presence of halogens.

Given that trifluoromethylbenzene has a similar aromatic structure with a highly electronegative trifluoromethyl group, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value. However, the exact value will depend on the specific influence of the trifluoromethyl group compared to the halogens in the examples.

Considering the trends and the electronegativity of fluorine, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1ccccc1 would be around 1000.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a sugar, specifically a hexose, which is similar to glucose. 

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups (OH) tend to have property values in the positive range. For instance, the molecule OCC(O)C(O)C(O)C(O)CO has a property value of 637.01905062. The structure of OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is similar in that it is a polyhydroxylated compound, which suggests it will also have a positive property value.

Considering the structural similarity to the example with a property value of 637.01905062, and the fact that the molecule in question is a cyclic form of a similar sugar, the predicted property value for OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O would be close to this value. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of OCC1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O is approximately 637.01905062.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a complex cyclic structure with multiple rings and functional groups, including ketones and esters. It resembles some of the more complex cyclic structures in the examples, such as:

- CC1(O)CCC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)CCC4(C)C3CCC21C, which has a property value of 271.66988923.
- CCC(=O)OC3CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)CCC1(C)C2CCC34C, which has a property value of -187.3585443.

The molecule CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C has additional functional groups compared to the second example, such as an ester linkage and additional hydroxyl groups, which could influence the property value.

Considering the structural complexity and the presence of multiple functional groups, the property value is likely to be influenced by these factors. The presence of additional oxygen-containing functional groups (like esters and hydroxyls) might lower the property value compared to a similar structure without them.

Given these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)OCC(=O)C3(O)CCC4C2CCC1=CC(=O)C=CC1(C)C2C(O)CC34C would be slightly lower than the example with a value of -187.3585443, due to the additional functional groups.

Therefore, a predicted property value could be approximately -250.0.

From the examples, we can observe that polycyclic compounds with ketone and hydroxyl groups tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule CC12CCC3C(CCc4cc(O)ccc34)C2CCC1O has a property value of -93.67927215. This molecule is somewhat similar in complexity and functional groups to the one we are analyzing.

Considering the structural similarities and the presence of functional groups, the predicted property value for CC34CCC1C(CCC2CC(=O)CCC12C)C3CCC4O is likely to be in the negative range, similar to the example provided. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be approximately -93.67927215.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is an acetanilide derivative with a nitro group. The presence of the nitro group (N(=O)=O) is a significant factor, as seen in other examples where nitro groups tend to contribute to negative property values. For instance, O=N(=O)c1ccccc1 has a property value of -430.92465189, and COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -618.28319619.

The acetanilide structure (CC(=O)Nc1ccccc1) itself is similar to other aromatic amides, which generally have less negative or slightly positive property values. However, the addition of the nitro group is expected to lower the property value significantly.

Considering these factors and the trends observed in the examples, the predicted property value for CC(=O)Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O is likely to be around -500.0. This is a rough estimate based on the influence of the nitro group and the aromatic amide structure.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

1. **Functional Groups and Structural Features:**
   - The molecule contains a phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(OCC)SC), which is not directly present in the examples, but it is a significant functional group that can influence the property.
   - It also contains a chlorinated aromatic ring, similar to some of the examples.
   - The molecule has an ester linkage (n1c(=O)oc2), which is present in some examples.

2. **Comparison with Examples:**
   - The presence of chlorine in aromatic rings is seen in several examples, such as Clc1cccc(Cl)c1c2ccccc2 and Clc1ccc(Cl)cc1, which have property values of -56.20756329 and 674.49075948, respectively.
   - The presence of an ester linkage is seen in examples like CCC(C)OC(=O)C, which has a property value of 365.34916138.
   - The presence of sulfur, as in CSSC, has a high property value of 1517.60420882, but this is a disulfide, which is different from the phosphorothioate.

3. **Prediction:**
   - Considering the combination of a phosphorothioate group, a chlorinated aromatic ring, and an ester linkage, the property value is likely to be influenced by the electronegative elements (Cl, O) and the presence of sulfur.
   - The examples with chlorine and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values, while those with ester linkages can vary.

Given these considerations, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)SCn1c(=O)oc2cc(Cl)ccc12 is likely to be negative, reflecting the influence of the chlorinated aromatic ring and the ester linkage. A reasonable estimate, considering the structural complexity and the presence of sulfur, would be around -800.0.

From the examples, we can observe that nitrogen-containing heterocycles, especially those with multiple nitrogen atoms, tend to have negative property values. For instance:

- Nc1nc(=O)[nH]cc1F has a property value of -440.2925791.
- Nc1cc[nH]c(=O)n1 has a property value of -374.7170886.
- COc2ncc1nccnc1n2 has a property value of -805.64174049.

Given the structural similarity of O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 to these examples, particularly the purine-like structure, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. Considering the trend and the complexity of the bicyclic structure, a value in the range of -400 to -800 seems plausible.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=c1[nH]cnc2nc[nH]c12 is approximately -600.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)OC=O, we need to analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities in their structures and corresponding property values.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is isopropyl acetate, an ester. In the provided examples, we have several molecules with similar functional groups or structural features:

1. CCOC=C (430.92465189) - This molecule is an ether with a double bond.
2. CCC(C)C(=O)C (552.70770568) - This molecule is a ketone with a similar carbon chain length.
3. CCC(C)(C)C (861.84930378) - This molecule is a branched alkane.

The molecule CC(C)OC=O is an ester, which is somewhat similar to the ether and ketone in terms of functional group complexity. The property values for these molecules are in the range of 430 to 552. Given that esters are generally more polar than ethers but less so than ketones, the property value for CC(C)OC=O is likely to be closer to the ketone value.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a diphenylurea, which consists of two phenyl rings connected by a urea linkage.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings and amide or urea linkages tend to have negative property values. For instance:

- NC(=O)c1cccnc1 has a property value of -430.92465189.
- CNC(=O)Oc1cc(C)cc(C)c1 has a property value of -552.70770568.
- Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O has a property value of -618.28319619.

Given that O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 is structurally similar to these examples, particularly NC(=O)c1cccnc1, which also contains an amide linkage and an aromatic ring, we can infer that the property value will likely be in the negative range.

Considering the structural similarity and the trend observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C(Nc1ccccc1)Nc2ccccc2 would be approximately -430.92465189, similar to the example with a single aromatic ring and an amide group.

True Property: -599.5473417569729
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. The given molecule is triphenylene, a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a fused ring system.

Looking at the examples, we notice that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, such as c1ccc2cc3cc4ccccc4cc3cc2c1 (a larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon), have a property value of -1330.24566452. The structure of triphenylene is somewhat similar but smaller in size compared to the larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the examples.

Given the trend that larger and more complex aromatic systems tend to have more negative property values, and considering the size and structure of triphenylene, we can predict that its property value will be negative and likely less negative than the larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C1c2ccccc2c3ccccc13 (triphenylene) would be around -1000.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring, which is a common feature in several examples with negative property values.
- A trifluoromethyl group (C(F)(F)F) attached to the aromatic ring, which can also contribute to a negative property value.
- An alkene group (CC(C)=C) attached to the nitrogen, which is less common in the examples but may not significantly alter the trend.

Based on the examples, molecules with nitro groups and aromatic rings tend to have negative property values. The presence of the trifluoromethyl group further suggests a negative value, as seen in other examples with similar groups.

Considering these structural features and the trends observed in the examples, the predicted property value for the molecule CCN(CC(C)=C)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O is likely to be negative and similar in magnitude to other nitroaromatic compounds.

A reasonable prediction for the property value is approximately -618.28319619, which aligns with the values of other nitroaromatic compounds in the examples.

The property values for these molecules are 1470.76457275, 1704.96275312, and 1292.77395566, respectively.

The molecule also contains a benzene ring with substituents: a methoxy group (OC), a thiomethyl group (SC), and a methyl group (C). The presence of these groups can influence the property value, but the phosphorothioate group is likely the dominant factor.

Considering the similarity in the core structure (phosphorothioate group) and the presence of different substituents on the benzene ring, the property value for COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(SC)c(C)c1 is likely to be in a similar range to the other phosphorothioate-containing molecules.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCCN(=O)=O, we need to analyze the given examples and identify patterns or trends that relate molecular structure to the property values.

The molecule CCCN(=O)=O is a simple alkyl chain (propyl group) with a nitro group attached. In the examples, simple alkyl chains like CCC (propane) have a property value of 861.84930378. However, the presence of functional groups like nitro groups (N(=O)=O) tends to significantly lower the property value, as seen in other examples with nitro groups.

For instance, the molecule CCCN(CCC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O has a very low property value of -1377.0853006, indicating that nitro groups contribute to a decrease in the property value.

Considering the effect of the nitro group, we can expect the property value for CCCN(=O)=O to be significantly lower than that of a simple alkane like CCC. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCN(=O)=O would be around -552.70770568, similar to other molecules with nitro groups and simple alkyl chains.

- Clc1ccc(Br)cc1 with a property value of 852.48137656
- c1c(Br)ccc2ccccc12 with a property value of 93.67927215

The molecule Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is similar to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but with a fluorine atom instead of a chlorine atom. Fluorine is more electronegative than chlorine, which might affect the property value. However, the presence of bromine is consistent in both molecules.

Considering these factors, the property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is likely to be in a similar range to Clc1ccc(Br)cc1, but potentially slightly different due to the substitution of fluorine for chlorine. Given the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Fc1cccc(Br)c1 would be around 852.48137656, with a slight adjustment for the electronegativity difference.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Fc1cccc(Br)c1 is approximately 852.48137656.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O contains a phosphorothioate group (P=S) and a cyclic imide structure, similar to the example CCOP(=S)(OCC)SC(CCl)N1C(=O)c2ccccc2C1=O, which has a property value of 459.02843353. The main difference is the substitution of the sulfur atom with a nitrogen atom in the imide ring.

Considering the structural similarity and the presence of the phosphorothioate group, the predicted property value for CCOP(=S)(OCC)N2C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O is likely to be close to 459.02843353. However, due to the absence of the sulfur atom and the presence of the nitrogen atom, the property value might be slightly lower.

To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. This molecule is a methylated derivative of a benzamide structure with a naphthyridine-like core.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with aromatic rings and heteroatoms (such as nitrogen and oxygen) tend to have negative property values. The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) and nitrogen atoms in heterocyclic rings also contributes to more negative values.

For instance, the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1C has a property value of 131.15098101, which is positive, likely due to its simple aromatic structure without additional electronegative atoms or functional groups. In contrast, molecules with more complex aromatic systems and additional functional groups, such as carbonyls or heteroatoms, tend to have negative values, such as c1ccc2c(c1)[nH]c3ccccc32 with a value of -786.90588606.

Given the structure of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C, which includes a carbonyl group and a nitrogen-containing heterocycle, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value. The presence of the carbonyl group and the nitrogen atoms in the heterocycle suggests a more negative value compared to simpler aromatic hydrocarbons.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1cc(=O)n(c2ccccc2)n1C would be approximately -600, considering its structural similarity to other molecules with negative values in the dataset.

To predict the property value for the molecule C=CCC=C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule C=CCC=C is a linear conjugated diene, specifically 1,3-butadiene.

Looking at the examples, we notice that simple hydrocarbons and conjugated systems tend to have positive property values. For instance, CC/C=C/C (a linear alkene) has a property value of 618.28319619, and CCC(C)(C)CC (a branched alkane) has a property value of 861.84930378. These values suggest that hydrocarbons with conjugated systems or increased branching tend to have higher positive property values.

Given that C=CCC=C is a simple conjugated diene, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value, likely in the range of the simpler hydrocarbons provided. Considering the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of C=CCC=C would be around 600 to 700.

To predict the property value for the molecule BrC(Br)Br, we need to consider the patterns and trends from the given examples. The property values seem to be influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups, the size of the molecule, and the presence of halogens.

The molecule BrC(Br)Br is a simple compound with three bromine atoms attached to a central carbon atom. In the examples, halogenated compounds tend to have higher property values, especially when multiple halogens are present. For instance, FC(F)(F)C(Cl)Br has a high property value of 1386.45322781, and Clc1cc(Cl)c(cc1Cl)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 758.80210441.

Given that BrC(Br)Br is a small molecule with three bromine atoms, we can expect its property value to be relatively high due to the presence of multiple heavy halogen atoms. However, it is likely to be lower than the values for larger or more complex halogenated compounds.

Based on these considerations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of BrC(Br)Br would be around 1000.

The molecule Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl has two chlorinated phenyl rings connected by an ether linkage. This structure is more complex than the first example but less complex than the second example, which has an additional phenyl ring.

Given the structural complexity and the presence of chlorine atoms, the property value is likely to be between the values of the two examples mentioned above. Considering the additional ether linkage, which might slightly lower the property value compared to a simple dichlorinated benzene, a reasonable prediction would be closer to the lower end of the range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl is approximately:

The molecule CCCOCC is a linear chain with an ether functional group (R-O-R') and a total of 5 carbon atoms. Let's compare it to similar structures in the examples:

1. CC(C)O (824.37759492) - This is a small alcohol with 3 carbon atoms.
2. CCC(O)CC (824.37759492) - This is a larger alcohol with 5 carbon atoms.
3. CCC#C (449.66050632) - This is a small alkyne with 4 carbon atoms.
4. CCC#C (449.66050632) - This is a small alkyne with 4 carbon atoms.
5. C1CCCCCC1 (861.84930378) - This is a cyclohexane with 6 carbon atoms.

The molecule CCCOCC is similar in size to CCC(O)CC, which has a property value of 824.37759492. However, CCCOCC is an ether, not an alcohol. Ethers generally have lower property values compared to alcohols due to the absence of hydrogen bonding.

Considering the examples and the nature of ethers, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOCC would be slightly lower than that of CCC(O)CC. Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCOCC could be around 700.0.

The molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is an acetanilide derivative with a bromine substituent on the phenyl ring. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Acetyl group (CC(=O)N-)**: This is a common feature in several molecules, such as CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -1096.04748415. The acetyl group contributes to the overall property value, often making it more negative.

2. **Phenyl ring (c1ccc(Br)cc1)**: The presence of a bromine atom on the phenyl ring is similar to Fc1cccc(Br)c1, which has a property value of 515.23599682. The bromine atom generally increases the property value due to its electronegativity and size.

3. **Amide linkage (NC(=O))**: This linkage is present in several molecules, such as CN(C)C(=O)C(c1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which contributes to a more negative property value.

Considering these structural features and their contributions, the molecule CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 is likely to have a property value that is influenced by both the electron-withdrawing nature of the acetyl group and the bromine atom. The presence of the amide linkage also suggests a more negative value.

Based on the examples and the structural analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC(=O)Nc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around -365.34916138, similar to Oc1ccc(C=O)cc1, which also has an electron-withdrawing group on a phenyl ring.

To predict the property value for the molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and look for patterns or similarities. The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is a combination of an isopropyl group (CC(C)C) and a phenyl group (c1ccccc1).

From the examples, we have:
- CC(C)CO, 824.37759492
- Cc1ccccc1N, -56.20756329
- CCc1ccc(C)cc1, 131.15098101
- CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1, 131.15098101

The molecule CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is similar to CCc1ccc(C)cc1 and CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1, both of which have a property value of 131.15098101. The presence of the isopropyl group (CC(C)C) and the phenyl group (c1ccccc1) in the molecule suggests that it should have a similar property value.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CC(C)Cc1ccccc1 is 131.15098101.

SMILES: O=Cc1ccccc1
True Property: -177.99061708410142
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=Cc1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule O=Cc1ccccc1 is benzaldehyde, which consists of a benzene ring with an aldehyde group attached.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Simple aromatic compounds like COc1ccccc1 (anisole) have a property value of -56.20756329.
- Compounds with nitro groups attached to an aromatic ring, such as O=N(=O)c1ccccc1N(=O)=O, have more negative property values, like -993.00028478.
- The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) in cyclic structures, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1O, results in a property value of -552.70770568.

Benzaldehyde has a carbonyl group attached to a benzene ring, similar to the structure of NC(=O)c1ccccc1O, but without the hydroxyl group. The presence of the carbonyl group in benzaldehyde is likely to contribute to a negative property value, but not as negative as those with additional electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of benzaldehyde (O=Cc1ccccc1) would be around -552.70770568, similar to NC(=O)c1ccccc1O, but slightly less negative due to the absence of the hydroxyl group.

Therefore, the predicted property value for O=Cc1ccccc1 is approximately -552.70770568.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The given molecule is a heterocyclic compound with a nitro group and an oxazole ring. The presence of these functional groups and the overall structure can be compared to similar molecules in the examples:

1. The molecule Clc2ccc1oc(=O)[nH]c1c2 has a similar heterocyclic structure with an oxazole ring and a property value of -281.03781645.
2. The molecule COc2ccc(Oc1ccc(NC(=O)N(C)C)cc1)cc2, which contains aromatic rings and a nitro group, has a property value of -1658.12311705.

Considering the structural similarities, particularly the presence of the oxazole ring and the nitro group, the property value for the given molecule is likely to be in the negative range, similar to the examples with heterocyclic and nitro-containing structures.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2CN(N=Cc1ccc(o1)N(=O)=O)C(=O)N2 would be approximately -500.0.

True Property: -974.2644303550811
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a diaryl hydrazine, which is structurally similar to the example N(=Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2, which has a property value of -974.26443036.

The main difference between the two molecules is the presence of a double bond in the example molecule, which is absent in the molecule we are predicting. The removal of the double bond in the hydrazine linkage typically results in a less negative property value due to the change in electronic structure and potential stabilization effects.

Considering this structural difference and the trend observed in the examples, the predicted property value for N(Nc1ccccc1)c2ccccc2 would likely be slightly less negative than -974.26443036. A reasonable estimate for the property value could be around -900.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule in question is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. 

Looking at the examples, we can identify some trends based on the molecular structure and the given property values. For instance, cyclic structures with amide groups tend to have negative property values, as seen in examples like C1N(C(=O)NCC(C)C)C(=O)NC1 (-318.50952531) and O=C1NC(=O)NC(=O)C1(CC)C(C)CCC (-440.2925791).

The molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 is similar to these examples in that it is a cyclic structure with two amide groups. Given the pattern observed, we can predict that the property value for this molecule will also be negative and likely in a similar range to the examples provided.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CCCC1)C(=O)N2 would be approximately -365.34916138, which is the same as the example O=C1CCCN1, another cyclic structure with a similar size and functional groups.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated biphenyl, specifically 2,2',4-trichlorobiphenyl.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Chlorinated aromatic compounds tend to have positive property values. For instance:
   - Clc1ccccc1Cl has a property value of 674.49075948.
   - Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a property value of 758.80210441.

2. The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, as seen in the examples.

Given that Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl is a trichlorinated biphenyl, we can expect its property value to be higher than that of Clc1ccccc1Cl, which is a dichlorobenzene.

Considering these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1ccc(cc1)c2c(Cl)cccc2Cl would be around 800. This is slightly higher than the dichlorobenzene example, accounting for the additional chlorine atom and the biphenyl structure.

SMILES: CCc1ccc(CC)cc1
True Property: 131.15098100933804
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1, we need to analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including functional groups, aromaticity, and the presence of heteroatoms.

The molecule CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a simple aromatic hydrocarbon, specifically an alkyl-substituted benzene (ethylbenzene). In the examples, similar simple hydrocarbons like CCCCCCCc1ccccc1 (a long-chain alkylbenzene) have a positive property value (131.15098101), while smaller aromatic compounds like Cc1ccccc1N (aniline) have a negative property value (-56.20756329).

Given that CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is a relatively simple aromatic hydrocarbon without additional functional groups that might significantly alter its property value, it is reasonable to predict a property value that is positive but not as high as the long-chain alkylbenzene. Considering the examples, a value around the lower end of the positive range for hydrocarbons seems appropriate.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCc1ccc(CC)cc1 is approximately 65.5754905.

True Property: -140.51890822429056
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O is a sulfonamide derivative, which is similar in some respects to nitrobenzene derivatives in terms of electron-withdrawing groups attached to an aromatic ring. In the examples, nitrobenzene derivatives such as Nc1ncnc2nc[nH]c12 (-683.85868669) and Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O (-618.28319619) have negative property values, indicating that the presence of strong electron-withdrawing groups like nitro groups tends to result in negative property values.

The sulfonamide group (S(N)(=O)=O) is also a strong electron-withdrawing group, similar to the nitro group. Therefore, we can expect the property value for Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O to be negative and in a similar range to the nitrobenzene derivatives.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Nc1ccc(cc1)S(N)(=O)=O would be approximately -618.28319619, similar to the nitrobenzene derivative Nc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O.

Predicted Property:
The molecule you provided, c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34, is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon known as triphenylene. To predict its property value based on the examples given, we need to identify a similar structure from the list.

The molecule c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4c3c2cc5ccccc54, with a property value of -1573.81177211, is a polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon with a similar structure to triphenylene, but it has an additional benzene ring, making it a larger and more complex structure.

Triphenylene is smaller and less complex than the molecule with a property value of -1573.81177211. Therefore, we can expect the property value of triphenylene to be less negative (or more positive) than -1573.81177211.

Considering the trend in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of triphenylene would be around -1330.24566452, which is the value for another polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, c1cccc2c3c(C)cc4ccccc4c3ccc12. This molecule is also similar in complexity to triphenylene.

Therefore, the predicted property value for c1ccc2c(c1)c3cccc4cccc2c34 (triphenylene) is approximately -1330.24566452.

Predicting the specific property value for the given molecule, Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3, based on the examples provided, involves analyzing the structural features and comparing them to the known examples.

The molecule in question appears to be a polycyclic aromatic compound with multiple hydroxyl groups and a ketone group. This structure is somewhat similar to other polycyclic aromatic compounds with multiple hydroxyl groups in the examples, such as Oc1ccc(cc1)C2(OC(=O)c3ccccc23)c4ccc(O)cc4, which has a property value of -2201.46289551.

Given the presence of multiple hydroxyl groups and the overall complexity of the structure, it is likely that the property value will be significantly negative, similar to other complex aromatic compounds with multiple functional groups.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc2cc(O)c1C(=O)CC(Oc1c2)c3ccc(O)c(O)c3 would be approximately -2000.0.

To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC contains:
- A phosphate group (P=O and P-O bonds)
- An amide linkage (NC(C)=O)
- A thioether linkage (SC)

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with phosphate groups, such as COP(=S)(OC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl and COP(=O)(OC)OC(=CCl)c1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, have relatively high property values (1292.77 and 927.42, respectively).
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as CCC1(C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O)C2=CCCCC2, tend to have negative property values (-683.86).
- Molecules with sulfur, such as CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, have high property values (1227.20).

Considering these observations, the presence of the phosphate group and sulfur linkage in COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC suggests a relatively high property value. However, the amide linkage might slightly reduce this value.

Based on the structural analysis and comparison with the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=O)(NC(C)=O)SC would be around 800.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cl\C=C/Cl, we need to consider the patterns and trends in the given examples. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, including the presence of specific functional groups and the overall size and complexity of the molecule.

The molecule Cl\C=C/Cl is a simple alkene with two chlorine atoms attached to a carbon-carbon double bond. This structure is relatively small and simple compared to many of the examples provided. In the examples, smaller and simpler molecules tend to have higher property values, while larger and more complex molecules, especially those with multiple functional groups, tend to have lower (more negative) property values.

Given the simplicity of Cl\C=C/Cl and the presence of two chlorine atoms, we can compare it to other chlorinated compounds in the examples. For instance, the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of 487.13221518, and it is a chlorinated aromatic compound. The molecule Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which is a highly chlorinated aromatic compound, has a property value of 1030.47199364.

Considering the simplicity and the presence of two chlorine atoms in Cl\C=C/Cl, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be positive and likely lower than the highly chlorinated aromatic compound but potentially higher than the simpler chlorinated aromatic compound.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cl\C=C/Cl is around 487.13221518, similar to the simpler chlorinated aromatic compound. However, given the simplicity of the molecule, it might be slightly lower, so a predicted value could be approximately 400.

SMILES: c1ccncc1
True Property: 65.57549050466902
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1ccncc1, we need to analyze the given examples and identify patterns or similarities. The molecule c1ccncc1 is pyridine, a six-membered aromatic ring with one nitrogen atom.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Aromatic compounds with a single ring and no additional functional groups, such as CNc1ccccc1 (aniline) and Cc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (nitrobenzene), have property values around -56.20756329 and -430.92465189, respectively.
- The presence of a nitrogen atom in the ring, as seen in c1cnc2c(c1)ccc3ncccc23 (quinoline), results in a property value of -974.26443036.

Given that pyridine is a simple aromatic ring with one nitrogen atom, it is likely to have a property value similar to other simple aromatic compounds with nitrogen. However, it is less complex than quinoline, which has a more negative property value due to its larger structure and additional nitrogen.

Considering these observations, the property value for pyridine (c1ccncc1) is likely to be closer to the simpler aromatic compounds with nitrogen, but not as negative as quinoline. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of pyridine is around -56.20756329, similar to other simple aromatic compounds in the examples.

To predict the property value for the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question has several key features:
1. An ester linkage (COC(=O)).
2. A phenyl ring (c1ccccc1).
3. An amide linkage (Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23).
4. A pyridine-like structure (ccnc).
5. A chlorine substituent on an aromatic ring.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of an amide linkage (e.g., CNC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C2OCCO2) also correlates with negative property values.
- The presence of an ester linkage (e.g., CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1C(=O)OCC) is associated with negative property values.

Considering these observations, the molecule OCC(O)COC(=O)c1ccccc1Nc2ccnc3cc(Cl)ccc23 has structural similarities with molecules that have negative property values, particularly due to the combination of aromatic rings, an amide linkage, and a chlorine substituent.

Based on these structural features and the trends observed in the examples, I predict that the property value for this molecule is likely to be negative. A reasonable estimate, considering the complexity and the presence of multiple aromatic systems and functional groups, would be around -1000.00000000.

The examples suggest that the property values are related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some aspect of molecular stability, reactivity, or another chemical property.

The molecule CCCCCO is a linear alcohol, specifically 1-pentanol. In the examples, linear alkanes and simple alcohols tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule OC1CCCCCCC1 (a cyclic alcohol) has a property value of 824.37759492, and COC=O (a simple ester) has a property value of 365.34916138.

Given that CCCCCO is a simple linear alcohol, we can expect its property value to be positive and likely in the range of other simple alcohols or esters. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCO would be around 824.37759492, similar to other simple alcohols in the dataset.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a sulfonamide with a benzene ring, a carbonyl group, and an ether linkage. Let's break down the structure:

1. **Sulfonamide Group (S(=O)(=O)N)**: This functional group is known for its electron-withdrawing properties and can significantly affect the overall property value. In the examples, molecules with strong electron-withdrawing groups tend to have negative property values.

2. **Benzene Ring (c2ccccc2)**: Aromatic rings are common in the examples, and they often contribute to the stability and electronic properties of the molecule.

3. **Carbonyl Group (C(=O))**: This group is also electron-withdrawing and can influence the property value similarly to the sulfonamide group.

4. **Ether Linkage (CCO1)**: This part of the molecule is less polar and may contribute to a less negative or more positive property value.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, particularly those with similar functional groups and aromatic systems, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of the sulfonamide and carbonyl groups.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC1=C(C(=O)Nc2ccccc2)S(=O)(=O)CCO1 would be around -500.0.

COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C

This molecule contains several key features:
- An ester group (COC(=O))
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring
- A heterocyclic ring with nitrogen (pyrrole-like structure)
- Multiple carbonyl groups

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with nitro groups, especially when attached to aromatic systems, tend to have negative property values (e.g., CCCCN(CC)c1c(cc(cc1N(=O)=O)C(F)(F)F)N(=O)=O, -1377.0853006).
- Aromatic systems with additional functional groups like carbonyls and esters also tend to have negative property values (e.g., CNC(=O)Oc1cccc(N=CN(C)C)c1, -1049.20784807).
- The presence of multiple electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro and carbonyl) generally leads to more negative values.

Considering these observations, the molecule COC(=O)C1=C(C)NC(=C(C1c2ccccc2N(=O)=O)C(=O)OC)C is expected to have a negative property value due to the presence of the nitro group, multiple carbonyls, and the aromatic system.

To predict the property value for the molecule O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule is a diketopiperazine, which is a cyclic dipeptide. 

Looking at the examples, we can see that cyclic structures, especially those with multiple rings or heteroatoms, tend to have negative property values. For instance, the molecule ClC(Cl)CC(=O)NC2=C(Cl)C(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O has a property value of -412.18879746, and it contains a similar amide linkage and cyclic structure.

Given the diketopiperazine structure, which is a relatively small and compact cyclic structure with two amide linkages, it is reasonable to predict a negative property value, but not as negative as larger or more complex aromatic systems.

Based on this analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of O=C2NC(=O)C1(CC1)C(=O)N2 would be around -300.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCC, we can look at the examples provided and try to find a pattern or similar structures. The molecule ClCC is a simple chlorinated ethane, which is a small and relatively simple structure.

From the examples, we can see that small, simple hydrocarbons like CCCCC (pentane) have a property value of 861.84930378, and CCC(C)(C)CC (2,2-dimethylbutane) also has the same value. However, these are larger hydrocarbons compared to ClCC.

For smaller molecules, such as CC#N (acetonitrile), the property value is 384.08501581. The molecule Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene) has a property value of 402.82087024, which is a bit larger and more complex than ClCC.

Considering the simplicity and size of ClCC, it is likely to have a property value closer to smaller molecules like CC#N. Given the presence of chlorine, which might increase the property value slightly compared to a simple hydrocarbon of similar size, we can estimate a value slightly higher than 384.08501581.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC would be approximately 400.0.

   - Clc1ccc(cc1)c2cccc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 215.46232594.

2. The presence of a trichloromethyl group (C(Cl)(Cl)Cl) also contributes to a positive property value. For example:
   - ClC(Cl)C(Cl)(Cl)SN2C(=O)C1CC=CCC1C2=O has a property value of 1227.19846516.
   - Clc1ccc(cc1)C(c2ccc(Cl)cc2)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl has a property value of 758.80210441.

Considering these observations, the molecule Clc1cccc(n1)C(Cl)(Cl)Cl is expected to have a positive property value due to the presence of both the chlorinated aromatic ring and the trichloromethyl group. Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around 758.80210441, similar to the other trichloromethyl-substituted aromatic compounds.

Given the structural similarity and the presence of the alcohol functional group, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CCCCC(C)O will be close to that of the other alcohols with similar chain lengths.

2. Aromatic compounds with halogen substitutions, such as Clc1ccc(cc1)c2ccccc2Cl (1,2-dichlorobenzene) and ClC(Cl)C(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)c2ccc(Cl)cc2 (1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane), also have relatively high property values.

Given these observations, and considering the presence of two bromine atoms (which are heavier than chlorine atoms), we can expect the property value for 1,4-dibromobenzene to be relatively high.

Based on the pattern and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Brc1ccc(Br)cc1 would be around 1676.85897148, similar to the value for ClC(Cl)Cl, but potentially slightly higher due to the presence of bromine instead of chlorine. However, without exact calculations or a clear pattern for bromine-containing compounds, this is an estimation based on the trends observed in the examples.

SMILES: Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl 
True Property: 1030.4719936447982
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property value is influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of halogens and aromatic rings.

The molecule Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl is a chlorinated biphenyl, similar to the example Clc1c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1Cl)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, which has a property value of 2117.15155058. The given molecule has a similar structure but with fewer chlorine atoms.

Considering the structural similarity and the pattern observed in the examples, the property value for Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl is likely to be slightly lower than 2117.15155058 due to the reduced number of chlorine atoms.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Clc1cc(Cl)c(c(Cl)c1)c2c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc2Cl would be approximately 2000.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a triaryl phosphate ester, which includes:
- Three aromatic rings (phenyl groups).
- Two methyl groups attached to two of the phenyl rings.
- A phosphate group linking the three phenyl groups.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and functional groups like phosphates or esters tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of electron-withdrawing groups (like nitro or carbonyl groups) or halogens often results in more negative values.
- The presence of alkyl chains or simple hydrocarbons tends to result in positive values.

Given the structure of the molecule, it is similar to other aromatic compounds with functional groups that have negative property values. The presence of the phosphate group and multiple aromatic rings suggests a more negative value.

Based on these observations and the trends from the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Cc1ccc(OP(=O)(Oc2cccc(C)c2)Oc3ccccc3C)cc1 would be around -500.0.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the given molecule, FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule contains:
- A trifluoromethyl group (CF3) attached to a phenyl ring, which is a common feature in several molecules.
- A cyclic amide structure (lactam) with two chlorine atoms attached to the cyclohexane ring.

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with halogen substitutions, especially multiple chlorines, tend to have higher property values.
- The presence of aromatic rings and carbonyl groups also influences the property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule has similarities with some of the higher property value examples, such as those with multiple halogens and aromatic rings. However, the presence of the trifluoromethyl group and the specific cyclic structure might moderate the value.

Based on these observations, a reasonable prediction for the property value of FC(F)(F)c1cccc(c1)N2CC(CCl)C(Cl)C2=O would be around 1300, considering the influence of the halogens and the aromatic structure.

Therefore, the predicted property value is approximately 1300.

To predict the property value for the molecule COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule is methoxy nitrobenzene, which consists of a benzene ring with a methoxy group (OCH3) and a nitro group (NO2) attached.

From the examples, we can observe that:
- Aromatic compounds with nitro groups tend to have negative property values, indicating a certain trend.
- The presence of a methoxy group (as in anisole, c1ccccc1O) results in a property value of -56.20756329.
- Nitrobenzene derivatives, such as O=N(=O)c1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O, have a property value of -993.00028478.

Considering these observations, the presence of both a methoxy group and a nitro group on the benzene ring suggests that the property value will be negative, likely between the values for anisole and dinitrobenzene.

Given the structure and the trends observed, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COc1ccccc1N(=O)=O would be approximately -500.0.

To predict the property value for the given molecule, ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a highly chlorinated cycloalkane, similar to the example ClC1C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C(Cl)C1Cl, which has a property value of 2491.86863918. Both molecules are heavily chlorinated, which significantly increases their property values due to the high atomic mass and electronegativity of chlorine atoms.

Given the structural similarity and the high degree of chlorination, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for ClC1CC2C(C1Cl)C3(Cl)C(=C(Cl)C2(Cl)C3(Cl)Cl)Cl will be in a similar range, possibly slightly higher due to the additional complexity and number of chlorine atoms.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately 2491.86863918.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOC=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCOC=O is a simple ester, specifically propyl formate.

From the examples, we can observe that:

1. Simple aliphatic chains like CCCCCCCC=C have a positive property value (618.28319619).
2. Molecules with functional groups like esters, amides, and others tend to have negative property values, such as CCOC(=O)c1ccc(N)cc1 (-552.70770568) and CNC(=O)Oc1cccc2CC(C)(C)Oc12 (-740.06624998).

Given that CCCOC=O is a small ester, it is likely to have a negative property value, similar to other small molecules with functional groups.

Considering the trend and the nature of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOC=O would be around -365.34916138, similar to NC(=O)c1ccccc1, which is a small molecule with a carbonyl group. However, since CCCOC=O is simpler and smaller, the value might be slightly less negative.

Therefore, a predicted property value for CCCOC=O could be approximately -300.

True Property: 365.3491613831558
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is an ester, specifically a decanoate ester, which is a relatively simple linear molecule with a long carbon chain.

From the examples, we can observe that linear aliphatic molecules, such as alkanes and simple esters, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule CCCCCC(CC)C=O has a property value of 552.70770568, and CCCCCC=C(CC)C=O has a property value of 309.14159809. These examples suggest that the property value increases with the length of the carbon chain.

Given that CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC is a decanoate ester, which is longer than the examples provided, we can reasonably predict that its property value will be higher than those of the shorter chains. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC would be around 700 to 900.

Based on this analysis, I would predict the property value for CCCCCCCCCC(=O)OCC to be approximately 800.

The molecule in question has the following features:
- A nitro group (N(=O)=O) attached to an aromatic ring.
- Two chlorine atoms attached to aromatic rings.
- An amide linkage (C(=O)N) connecting two aromatic rings.

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with nitro groups, such as Clc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, have negative property values (-159.25476265).
- Molecules with chlorine atoms on aromatic rings, such as Oc1cc(Cl)ccc1Oc2ccc(Cl)cc2Cl, also have negative property values (-159.25476265).
- Molecules with amide linkages, such as NC(=O)c1ccccc1, have negative property values (-365.34916138).

Given these observations, the molecule Oc1ccc(Cl)cc1C(=O)Nc2ccc(cc2Cl)N(=O)=O is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of the nitro group, chlorine atoms, and the amide linkage.

Considering the structural similarities and the negative contributions from these functional groups, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule would be around -159.25476265, similar to other molecules with nitro and chlorine groups.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule in question contains two phosphorothioate groups (P(=S)(OC)O), which are similar to the phosphorothioate group in the example molecule COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, which has a property value of 768.17003163. However, the molecule in question has two such groups, which could potentially increase the property value.

Additionally, the molecule has two aromatic rings connected by a sulfur atom, which is a feature not directly seen in the examples but can be compared to other aromatic systems. The presence of multiple aromatic rings and sulfur linkages might suggest a more complex structure, potentially leading to a higher property value.

Considering these factors and the examples provided, a reasonable prediction for the property value of COP(=S)(OC)Oc1ccc(Sc2ccc(OP(=S)(OC)OC)cc2)cc1 would be around 1500. This accounts for the additional complexity and the presence of two phosphorothioate groups compared to the example with one such group.

SMILES: Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O
True Property: -618.2831961868787
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a nitrophenol, specifically 4-nitrophenol, which has a nitro group (-NO2) and a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to a benzene ring.

From the examples, we can identify a few relevant patterns:

1. **Aromatic Compounds with Nitro Groups**: 
   - Cc1ccccc1N(=O)=O has a property value of -430.92465189.
   - Clc1ccc(Oc1ccc(cc1)N(=O)=O)c(Cl)c2 has a property value of -805.64174049.

2. **Aromatic Compounds with Hydroxyl Groups**:
   - NC(=O)c1ccccc1O has a property value of -552.70770568.
   - Cc1cc(C)cc(O)c1 has a property value of -56.20756329.

3. **Aromatic Compounds with Both Nitro and Hydroxyl Groups**:
   - The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is similar to the combination of the above two types, with both a nitro and a hydroxyl group on a benzene ring.

Considering these patterns, the presence of both a nitro group and a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring tends to result in a more negative property value compared to having just one of these groups. The nitro group generally contributes to a more negative value due to its electron-withdrawing nature.

Given these observations, the predicted property value for Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is likely to be more negative than -430.92465189 but not as negative as -805.64174049, as it has only one nitro group and one hydroxyl group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O is approximately -552.70770568, aligning it with the pattern observed for aromatic compounds with similar functional groups.

Predicted Property:
Predicting the property value for the given molecule, OCC1OC(CO)(OC2OC(COC3OC(CO)C(O)C(O)C3O)C(O)C(O)C2O)C(O)C1O, involves analyzing its structure and comparing it to the examples provided. The molecule appears to be a complex carbohydrate, likely a polysaccharide or a derivative, given the multiple sugar-like rings and hydroxyl groups.

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with multiple hydroxyl groups and complex ring structures, such as sugars, tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule C1OC(O)C(O)C(O)C1O, which is a simple sugar, has a property value of 674.49075948.

Considering the complexity and the number of hydroxyl groups in the given molecule, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be higher than that of the simpler sugar example. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of the given molecule is approximately 800.0.

SMILES: CCC#C
True Property: 449.6605063177302
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCC#C, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule CCC#C is a linear alkyne, specifically 1-butyne, with a terminal triple bond.

Looking at the examples, we can see that linear alkanes and alkenes like CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCO and CCCCCCCCCC=C have positive property values, such as 824.37759492 and 618.28319619, respectively. These molecules are relatively simple hydrocarbons with no polar functional groups, similar to CCC#C.

Given that CCC#C is a small, simple hydrocarbon with a triple bond, it is reasonable to predict that its property value will be positive and likely closer to the lower end of the positive values seen in the examples, as it is a smaller molecule compared to the long-chain hydrocarbons.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCC#C would be around 365.34916138, which is similar to the value for CC(C)OC=O, another small molecule with a simple structure.

To predict the property value for the molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl contains:
- A phosphorothioate group (P=S)
- An ether linkage (O)
- A chlorinated aromatic ring with three chlorine atoms

From the examples, we can identify some relevant patterns:
- Molecules with multiple chlorine atoms on an aromatic ring, such as Clc1cccc(Cl)c1Cl and Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)c(Cl)c(Cl)c2Cl, have relatively high property values (946.16064871 and 1030.47199364, respectively).
- Molecules with a phosphorothioate group, such as COP(=S)(OC)SCC(=O)N(C(C)C)c1ccc(Cl)cc1, have a property value of 768.17003163.

Considering these observations, the presence of multiple chlorine atoms on the aromatic ring and the phosphorothioate group suggests that the property value for CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl is likely to be relatively high, similar to the examples with similar features.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOP(=S)(CC)Oc1cc(Cl)c(Cl)cc1Cl would be around 768.17003163, as it shares structural similarities with the example containing a phosphorothioate group and chlorinated aromatic ring.

True Property: -468.39636074763524
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1, we need to consider the structural features and compare them with the examples provided.

The molecule c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 is a pyridine ring with a carbonyl group (C=O) and a hydrazine group (NN) attached. This structure is somewhat similar to the example Nc2nc1[nH]cnc1c(=O)[nH]2, which has a pyrimidine ring with a carbonyl group and an amine group. The property value for this example is -871.21723099.

Given the structural similarity, particularly the presence of a nitrogen-containing heterocycle and a carbonyl group, we can infer that the property value for c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 might be in a similar range. However, the presence of the hydrazine group (NN) instead of an amine group could slightly alter the property value.

Taking these considerations into account, a reasonable prediction for the property value of c1nccc(C(=O)NN)c1 would be approximately -900.0. This value reflects the influence of the nitrogen heterocycle and the carbonyl group, with a slight adjustment for the hydrazine group.

True Property: 1227.1984651588048
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C, we need to analyze the structural features and compare them with the examples provided. The molecule contains several functional groups and structural motifs:

1. **Phosphorothioate group (P(=S)(O)O)**: This is a key feature that can influence the property significantly. In the examples, the presence of phosphorus or sulfur-containing groups often results in a negative property value.

2. **Amide group (C(=O)N)**: Amides are present in some of the examples, and they tend to contribute to a negative property value.

3. **Cyclohexane ring (N1CCCCC1)**: This is a saturated ring structure, which is present in some examples with varying effects on the property value.

4. **Alkyl chains (CCC, OCCC, SCC)**: These are common in many examples and generally contribute to a positive property value, but their effect can be moderated by other functional groups.

Considering these features and comparing them with the examples, particularly those with similar functional groups and structural complexity, the molecule is likely to have a negative property value due to the presence of the phosphorothioate and amide groups, which are known to contribute negatively in the examples.

Based on the analysis, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCOP(=S)(OCCC)SCC(=O)N1CCCCC1C would be approximately -500.0. This value reflects the influence of the phosphorothioate and amide groups, balanced by the presence of alkyl chains and the cyclohexane ring.

SMILES: CCCCCCCC
True Property: 861.8493037756493
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCC, we can look at the examples provided and identify patterns or trends. The molecule CCCCCCCC is a linear alkane, specifically octane.

From the examples, we can see that linear alkanes and similar structures tend to have positive property values. For instance:

- CCCCCC (hexane) has a property value of 824.37759492.
- CCCCCCCO (heptanol) has a property value of 824.37759492.
- CCC(C)C1(CC(Br)=C)C(=O)NC(=O)NC1=O (a more complex structure) has a property value of -234.19818037, which is negative, indicating that more complex or functionalized molecules tend to have negative values.

Given that CCCCCCCC (octane) is a simple linear alkane, we can expect its property value to be similar to that of hexane and heptanol, which are also simple hydrocarbons. Therefore, the predicted property value for CCCCCCCC is likely to be around 824.37759492, similar to the other simple alkanes in the examples.

Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided.

The molecule in question is a polycyclic compound with a hydroxyl group (O) and a carbon-carbon triple bond (C#C). It resembles some of the polycyclic structures in the examples, such as:

1. CC12CCC3C(CCC4=CC(=O)CCC34C)C2CCC1O, which has a property value of 271.66988923.
2. CC1CC2C3CCC4=CC(=O)C=CC4(C)C3(F)C(O)CC2(C)C1(O)C(=O)CO, which has a property value of -421.55672467.

The presence of the hydroxyl group and the carbon-carbon triple bond in the molecule may influence the property value. The examples suggest that polycyclic structures with oxygen-containing functional groups tend to have negative property values, especially when they include additional functional groups like carbonyls or hydroxyls.

Considering these factors, the predicted property value for the molecule CC34CCC1C(CCC2=CC(=O)CCC12O)C3CCC4(O)C#C is likely to be negative and closer to the value of the second example due to the presence of the hydroxyl group and the triple bond, which may contribute to a more negative value.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of this molecule is approximately -400.

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be a complex polycyclic structure with multiple ether and ester linkages, as well as several aromatic rings. The presence of methoxy groups (OC) and hydroxyl groups (O) suggests some similarity to other molecules in the dataset that contain these functional groups.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple rings and oxygen-containing functional groups, it is reasonable to compare this molecule to other complex polycyclic structures in the dataset. One such example is:

C1C(O)CCC2(C)CC3CCC4(C)C5(C)CC6OCC(C)CC6OC5CC4C3C=C21, 505.86806961

This molecule is also a complex polycyclic structure with multiple oxygen atoms and rings. Based on this comparison, the predicted property value for the given molecule is likely to be in a similar range.

Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67 is approximately:

SMILES: Oc1ccccc1Cl
True Property: 215.4623259439123
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the presence of specific functional groups and the overall structure of the molecule.

The molecule Oc1ccccc1Cl is a chlorophenol, which is similar to some of the examples provided. For instance, the molecule Fc1ccccc1 (fluorobenzene) has a property value of 65.5754905, and Clc1ccccc1I (iodobenzene) has a property value of 1086.67955693. These examples suggest that halogenated benzene rings tend to have positive property values.

Considering the presence of both a hydroxyl group (OH) and a chlorine atom (Cl) on the benzene ring, we can compare it to other molecules with similar functional groups. The molecule Oc1cccc(c1)N(=O)=O (nitrophenol) has a property value of -618.28319619, indicating that the presence of a nitro group significantly lowers the property value.

However, the presence of a chlorine atom, as seen in Clc1ccccc1 (chlorobenzene), which is not directly listed but can be inferred from similar structures, would likely have a positive influence on the property value.

Taking into account the balance between the hydroxyl group and the chlorine atom, and comparing it to similar structures, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1ccccc1Cl would be slightly positive, but not as high as chlorobenzene alone due to the presence of the hydroxyl group.

Therefore, a predicted property value for Oc1ccccc1Cl could be approximately 65.5754905, similar to Fc1ccccc1, considering the influence of the hydroxyl group.

- A chloroalkyne group (ClCC#C)
- An ester linkage (OC(=O))
- An amide linkage (NC(=O))
- A chlorinated aromatic ring (c1cccc(Cl)c1)

From the examples, we can observe:
- Molecules with aromatic rings and halogens (e.g., Cl, F) tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of carbonyl groups (C=O) in esters and amides also contributes to negative property values.
- The presence of multiple halogens, especially chlorine, tends to increase the magnitude of the negative property value.

Considering these factors, the molecule ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 is expected to have a negative property value. Given the structural complexity and the presence of multiple electronegative atoms and functional groups, the property value is likely to be significantly negative.

Based on the trends observed in the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCC#CCOC(=O)Nc1cccc(Cl)c1 would be approximately -600.0.

- Another phenyl ring with a chlorine substituent.

From the examples, we can observe the following trends:
- Molecules with multiple aromatic rings and halogen substituents tend to have negative property values.
- The presence of heterocyclic rings like pyrimidine (c2cncnc2) also contributes to negative property values.
- The presence of multiple chlorine atoms generally increases the property value, but in this case, the overall structure and the presence of heterocycles and phenol suggest a negative value.

Considering these observations, the molecule OC(c1ccc(Cl)cc1)(c2cncnc2)c3ccccc3Cl is likely to have a negative property value. Based on the structural similarities to other molecules with negative values, a reasonable prediction for the property value would be around -800.0.

SMILES: CCCCOC=O
True Property: 365.3491613831558
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCOC=O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule CCCCCOC=O is similar in structure to CCCCCCC=O, which has a property value of 552.70770568. Both molecules contain a carbon chain with a carbonyl group, but CCCCCOC=O has an ether linkage (OC=O) instead of a simple ketone (C=O) as in CCCCCCC=O.

Given the structural similarity and the presence of the ether linkage, which might slightly alter the property value, the predicted property value for CCCCCOC=O should be close to that of CCCCCCC=O. Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCOC=O is approximately 552.70770568.

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1405.1890822429064
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we can look at the examples provided and identify patterns or similarities. The molecule ClCCl is similar to ClCCCl, which has a property value of 1405.18908224. The difference between ClCCl and ClCCCl is the presence of an additional carbon atom in ClCCCl.

Given that ClCCl is a smaller molecule with one less carbon atom, we can reasonably predict that its property value will be somewhat lower than that of ClCCCl. However, without a clear pattern or formula to determine the exact difference, we can only make an educated guess.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be slightly lower than 1405.18908224, but still relatively high due to the presence of chlorine atoms. A plausible estimate could be around 1300.0, considering the trend observed in the examples.

True Property: -56.20756328971609
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule Cc1cccc(C)c1O is a methylphenol, specifically p-cresol, which is a benzene ring with a methyl group and a hydroxyl group attached.

From the examples, we can identify a few relevant patterns:

1. **Aromatic Compounds with Hydroxyl Groups:**
   - Oc1cccc(O)c1: -243.56610759
   - c1(O)cc(O)ccc1CCCCCC: -243.56610759

2. **Aromatic Compounds with Methyl Groups:**
   - CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O: -56.20756329

3. **Aromatic Compounds with Both Methyl and Hydroxyl Groups:**
   - The closest example to p-cresol is CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, which has a similar structure with a methyl group and a hydroxyl group on an aromatic ring, and its property value is -56.20756329.

Given these observations, the property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O (p-cresol) is likely to be similar to that of CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1O, as they both have a similar functional group arrangement on an aromatic ring.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Cc1cccc(C)c1O is approximately:

-56.20756329

SMILES: Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl 
True Property: 487.1322151775409
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of halogens like chlorine and bromine, as well as the overall aromaticity and connectivity of the molecule.

The molecule Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is a biphenyl structure with four chlorine atoms. We can compare it to similar structures in the examples:

1. Clc2c(Cl)c(Cl)c(c1ccccc1)c(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 758.80210441.
2. Clc1ccc(Cl)c(c1)c2c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c2Cl has a property value of 1030.47199364.
3. Oc1c(Cl)c(Cl)cc(Cl)c1Cl has a property value of 1030.47199364.

The molecule in question is similar to these examples, particularly the second one, which is a biphenyl with multiple chlorine atoms. Given the pattern observed, the property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is likely to be close to the value for the second example.

Therefore, the predicted property value for Clc1ccc(c(Cl)c1)c2cc(Cl)ccc2Cl is approximately 1030.47199364.

SMILES: CC=C(C)C
True Property: 618.2831961868789
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CC=C(C)C, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples include various types of molecules, and their property values seem to be related to their structural features, such as the presence of functional groups, rings, and overall molecular complexity.

The molecule CC=C(C)C is a simple alkene, specifically 2-methyl-2-butene. In the examples, simple hydrocarbons like alkanes and alkenes tend to have positive property values. For instance, the molecule CCCCCCCCCC=C (a longer alkene) has a property value of 618.28319619, and CCCCCCCC (an alkane) has a property value of 861.84930378.

Given that CC=C(C)C is a smaller and less complex molecule compared to the longer alkenes and alkanes in the examples, we can expect its property value to be lower than those of the larger hydrocarbons. However, it should still be positive, as seen with other simple hydrocarbons.

Based on this reasoning, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CC=C(C)C would be around 131.15098101, which is similar to the value for CC(C)c1ccc(C)cc1, another relatively simple hydrocarbon. Therefore, the predicted property value for CC=C(C)C is:

SMILES: ClCCl
True Property: 1405.1890822429064
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule ClCCl, we need to consider the patterns and trends from the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall complexity of the molecule.

The molecule ClCCl is dichloromethane, a simple molecule with two chlorine atoms attached to a single carbon atom. In the examples, simpler molecules with halogen atoms, such as Clc1cccc(Cl)c1 (215.46232594) and ClC(=C(Cl)Cl)Cl (1704.96275312), have positive property values. However, these examples are more complex than ClCCl.

Given the simplicity of ClCCl compared to the examples, and considering that simpler halogenated compounds tend to have lower positive values, a reasonable prediction for the property value of ClCCl would be a small positive number. 

Therefore, the predicted property value for ClCCl is approximately 100.

SMILES: Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl
True Property: 758.8021044111695
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is a chlorinated phenol, specifically 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.

From the examples, we can observe that the presence of chlorine atoms generally increases the property value. For instance, Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl has a property value of 758.80210441. The molecule Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is similar, with three chlorine atoms attached to a phenol ring.

Given the pattern observed in the examples, the presence of additional chlorine atoms tends to increase the property value. Therefore, the property value for Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl is likely to be higher than that of Oc1c(Cl)cc(Cl)cc1Cl.

Considering these factors, a reasonable prediction for the property value of Oc1c(Cl)ccc(Cl)c1Cl would be approximately 758.80210441, as it is a similar structure with an additional chlorine atom, which should increase the value slightly. However, without more specific data or a clear trend, this is an estimation based on the closest example.

True Property: -2257.6704588036023
Predicted Property:
Predicting the specific property value for the given molecule based on the examples provided is a complex task, as it involves understanding the relationship between molecular structure and the property values, which are not explicitly defined in the examples. However, I can attempt to make an educated guess based on the patterns observed in the examples.

The molecule provided is:

COc1cc(cc(OC)c1O)C6C2C(COC2=O)C(OC4OC3COC(C)OC3C(O)C4O)c7cc5OCOc5cc67

This molecule appears to be quite complex, with multiple aromatic rings, ether linkages, and a significant degree of oxygenation. In the examples, complex molecules with multiple rings and heteroatoms tend to have negative property values, often significantly so.

Given the complexity and the presence of multiple oxygen-containing functional groups, which often correlate with negative property values in the examples, I would predict that the property value for this molecule is likely to be negative and relatively large in magnitude.

Based on the examples, a reasonable prediction for the property value might be around -1500 to -2000. However, without a clear understanding of what the property represents, this is a speculative estimate.

Therefore, my predicted property value for the molecule is approximately:

-1750.

SMILES: CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C
True Property: -112.4151265794324
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C, we need to analyze the structure and compare it with the examples provided. The molecule contains a thiosemicarbazide moiety (CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)) and a tert-butyl group (C(C)(C)C).

From the examples, we can observe that molecules with similar functional groups and structural complexity tend to have similar property values. For instance, the molecule CN1CC(O)N(C1=O)c2nnc(s2)C(C)(C)C has a similar thiosemicarbazide moiety and a tert-butyl group, and its property value is -271.66988923.

Given the structural similarities, it is reasonable to predict that the property value for CSc1nnc(c(=O)n1N)C(C)(C)C will be close to -271.66988923. Therefore, the predicted property value for the molecule is approximately:

-271.66988923

SMILES: CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1
True Property: -365.34916138315555
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The molecule in question is ethyl benzoate, which is an ester derived from benzoic acid and ethanol.

From the examples, we can observe that:

- Esters like CCCCCC(=O)OC have a property value of 365.34916138.
- Aromatic compounds like CC2=CC(=O)c1ccccc1C2=O (which is a diketone with an aromatic ring) have a property value of -730.69832277.
- The molecule CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is an ester with an aromatic ring, similar to the combination of the two examples above.

Considering the structure of ethyl benzoate, which is an ester with an aromatic ring, the property value is likely to be influenced by both the ester and aromatic characteristics. The property value for esters is generally positive, while aromatic compounds can have negative values depending on their specific structure and functional groups.

Given the examples and the nature of the molecule, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 would be around the average of the ester and aromatic values, but slightly more negative due to the aromatic influence.

Therefore, the predicted property value for CCOC(=O)c1ccccc1 is approximately -730.69832277.

SMILES: CCCCCCCBr
True Property: 1311.5098100933792
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CCCCCCCBr, we can analyze the given examples and their corresponding property values. The examples suggest that the property values are influenced by the molecular structure, particularly the presence of certain functional groups and the overall size of the molecule.

The molecule CCCCCCCBr is a linear alkyl chain with a bromine atom attached. In the examples, the molecule Brc1ccc2ccccc2c1, which contains a bromine atom attached to an aromatic ring, has a property value of 93.67927215. The molecule CCCCCCCCO, which is a linear alkyl chain with an alcohol group, has a property value of 824.37759492.

Considering that CCCCCCCBr is similar in structure to CCCCCCCCO but with a bromine atom instead of an alcohol group, we can expect the property value to be somewhat similar but likely lower due to the different nature of the bromine atom compared to the alcohol group.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CCCCCCCBr would be around 824.37759492, but slightly lower due to the presence of bromine instead of an alcohol group. A predicted value could be approximately 700.0.

SMILES: CO
True Property: 824.3775949158385
Predicted Property:
To predict the property value for the molecule CO (carbon monoxide), we need to consider the pattern in the given examples. The property values seem to be related to the molecular structure, possibly reflecting some thermodynamic or electronic property.

Carbon monoxide is a simple diatomic molecule with a triple bond between carbon and oxygen. It is much smaller and simpler than most of the molecules listed, which are larger organic compounds or complex structures.

Given the examples, smaller and simpler molecules like CCC (propane) and CC#C (propyne) have positive property values, while more complex molecules tend to have negative values. The smallest molecule in the examples, NC(=O)N (urea), has a positive value of 177.99061708.

Considering the simplicity and small size of CO, it is reasonable to predict a positive property value, likely smaller than that of urea due to its even simpler structure.

Therefore, a reasonable prediction for the property value of CO would be a small positive number, such as:

**100.0**
